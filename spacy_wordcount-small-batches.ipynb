[PRESENTED I\\ THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND  ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 13, 1847.]   INTRODUCTION.   General considerations ivhich should serve as a guide in adopting a  Flan of Organization.  1. Will of Smithson. The property is bequeathed to the United  States of America, \" to found at Washington, under the name of the  Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffu-  sion of knowledge among men,\"  2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government of  the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the  testator.  3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently  supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and  perpetuate h's name.  4. The ( jects of the Institution are, 1st, to increase, and 2d, to  diffuse knowledge among men.  5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.  The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addi-  tion of new truths ; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus  increased, among men.  6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of  knowledge ; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.  7. Knowledge can be increased by difterent methods of facilitating  and promoting the discovery of new truths ; and can be most exten-  sively diffused among men by means of the press.  8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should  be such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of  increasing and difi'usiug knowledge, which cannot be produced either  at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.  9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provi-  sionally, can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or be  abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.  10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time  occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution,   8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.  a considerable portion of the interest which, has accrue\"?, should be  added to the principal.  11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultit^aied,  the funds are small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the  construction of the building ; and not only the first cost of the edifice  should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in  repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected  with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-  ported by the Institution.  12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined  by the plan of organization, and not the converse.  13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be bene-  fitted by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure  on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.  14. Besides the foregoing considerations deduced immediately from  the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements  of the act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a  library, a museum, and a gallery of art^ with a building on a liberal  scale to contain them.  SECTION I.  Plan of Organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing  deductions from the will of Smithson.  To Increase Knowledge. It is proposed â€”  1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-  ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths ; and  2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income lor particular  researches, under the direction of suitable persons.  To Diffuse Knowledge. It is proposed â€”  1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the  different branches of knowledge ; and  2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general  interest.  DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.  I. â€” By stimulating researches.  1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all  branches of knowledge.  2. The memoirs tlius obtained to be published in a series of volumes,  in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to Know-  ledge.  3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for  publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human  knowledge, resting on original research ; and all unverified specula-  tions to be rejected.  4. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for  examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in   PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9  the brancli to which the memoir pertains ; and to be accepted for pub-  lic '\"ion only in case the report of this commission is favorable.  5. The comm^*''sion to be chosen hy the officers of the Institution,  and the name ot the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a  favorable decision be made.  6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions  of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to all the  colleges and principal libraries in this country. One part of the  remaining copies may be offered for sale; and the other carefully pre-  served, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand from  new institutions.  7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs  to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to  Congress.  II. â€” By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects of  research, under the direction of suitable persons.  1. The objects, and the amount appropriated, to be recommended  by counsellors of the Institution.  2. Appropriations in different years to different objects, so that, in  course of time, each branch of knowledge may receive a share.  3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published,  with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithsonian  Contributions to Knowledge.  4. Examples of objects tor which appropriations may be made.  (1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving the  problem of American storms.  (2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological^  magnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the  formation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.  (3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determination  of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of light ;  chemical analyses of soils and plants ; collection and publication of  scientific facts^ accumulated in the offices of government.  (4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,  moral, and political subjects.  (5.) Historical researches and accurate surveys of j^laces celebrated  in American history.  (6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the dif-  ferent races of men in North America; also, explorations and accurate  surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people of our  country.  DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.  I. â€” By tlie publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new  discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year in  all branches of knoivledge not strictly professional,  1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally interest-  ing, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the   10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.  reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals, as the  income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of knowledge  may indicate.  2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the  different branches of knowledge.  3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publica-  tions, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his report;  to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on the title-  page of the report.  4. The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons  interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it  without purchasing the whole.  5. These reports may be presented to Congress for partial distri-  bution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific  institutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.  The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in  the reports :  I. PHYSICAL CLASS.  1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,  and meteorology.  2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.  3. Agriculture.  4. Application of science to arts.  II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.  5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,  antiquities, &c.  6. Statistics and political economy.  T. Mental and moral philosophy.  8. A survey of the political events of the world, penal reform, &c.  III. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.  9. Modern literature.  10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.  11. Bibliography.  12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.  II. By the puUication of separate treatises on suhjects of generol interest.  1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs  translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the  direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the  best exposition of a given subject.  2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission  of competent judges previous to their publication.   PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 11  3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of  the present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in  the table of reports.  SECTION II.  Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of  the Board of Begents providing for the two modes of increasing and  diffusing hioioledge.  1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated  the formation of a library and a museum ; and the Board of Kegents,  including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide  the income* into two equal parts.  2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge  by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme  before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation of  a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art,  3. These two plans are not incompatible one with another.  4. To carry out the plan before described^ a library will be required,  consisting, 1st, of a complete collection of the transactions and pro-  ceedings of all the learned societies in the world ; 2d, of the more  important current periodical publications, and other works necessary  in preparing the periodical reports.  5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of  objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.  6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of  experimental science.  7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those men-  tioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the United  States should be procured, in order that the valuable books first pur-  chased may be such as are not to be found in the United States.  8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,  should be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of biblio-  graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any work  which he may require.  9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase  by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-  vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary  to purchase articles of this kind.  10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts  of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.  11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of ex-  pense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other  similar societies.   * The amount of the Smithsonian bequest received into the Treasury of the  United States is $515,169 00  Interest on the same to July 1, 1846, (devoted to the erection of the  building) 242,129 00  Annual income from tJie bequest. , 30,910 14   12 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.  12. A small appropriation sliould annually be made for models of  antiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.  13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, be-  sides the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except  one, to act as librarian.  14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to  the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,  keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and  keejjer of the museum, and may, with the consent of i;he Regents,  employ assistants.  15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,  will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit  new objects of art ; distinguished individuals should also be invited to  give lectures on subjects of general interest.   This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has be-  come the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change  is that expressed by the following resolutions, adopted January 15^  1855, viz :  Itesolved, That the 7th resolution passed by the Board of Regents,  on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the in-  come between the active operations and the museum and library,  when the buildings are completed, be and it is hereby repealed.  Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-  tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the  Institution, in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,  be necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-  ance, and a compliance in good faith with the law.   EEPOET or THE SECEETARY EOE 1857   To the Board of Regents:  Gentlemen : It again becomes my duty to present to you the  history of the operations of another year of the Institution which  the government of the United States has entrusted to your care. In  an establishment of this kind, of which the policy has been settled  and is strictly adhered to, there must of necessity be much sameness in  the general form and character of the successive reports ; but since  the field of science is boundless, and new portions of it are continually  presented for investigation, there will always be found in the details,  facts of sufficient interest to relieve the routine of the statements  relative to the condition of the funds and the scrutiny of the receipts  and expenditures.  It might at first sight appear surprising that so constant a supply  of materials for the Smithsonian Contributions and so many objects of  interest, demanding the assistance of the Smithsonian fund, should  be presented, but it will be evident, on reflection, that this results  from the influence of the Institution itself in increasing the number  of laborers in the field of science, as well as in accumulating the  materials on which they are to be engaged. The tendency is con-  stantly to expand the operations, and much caution and self-control  are necessary to repress the desire to be more liberal in the assistance  rendered to worthy objects, than the income will permit. Indeed, a  charge is frequently made of illiberality for what is the result of re-  stricted means. It must be evident that nothing is more important to  the permanency and proper conduct of the Institution than the cautious  and judicious management of its funds. Any embarrassment in this  quarter would involve a loss of confidence in the directors^ which would  be fatal to the usefulness and efficiency of the establishment.  I have from the first expressed the regret that the original law of  Congress directed the expenditure of so large a portion of the income  on objects of a local character, and this feeling has been increased by  the experience which time has afforded in regard to the good which  could be eflected by a more critical observance of the terms of the   14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  \"bequest, as well as by the increasing expense of sustaining a large  building, a library, and museum. It is to be hoped, however, that  at least a partial relief will hereafter be afforded by an annual appro-  priation, which it is reasonable to expect government will make for  the keeping and exhibition of the collections of the various exploring  expeditions which have been entrusted to the care of the Regents.  At the last session of Congress an appropriation was made for the  construction and erection of cases to receive the collections of the  United States Exploring Expedition and others in Washington, and  also for the transfer and arrangement of the specimens. This appro-  priation was granted in accordance with the recommendation of the  late Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Patents, in  order that the large room in the Patent Office occupied by the museum  might be used for the more legitimate purposes of that establishment.  We presume that the other part of the recommendation will also be  carried out, namely, that the annual appropriation be continued which  has heretofore been made for the care of this portion of the govern-  ment property. While, on the one hand, no appropriation should be  made which would serve to lessen the distinctive character of Smith-  son's bequest, on the other it is evident that the government should  not impose any burdens upon the Institution which would impair its  usefulness or divert its funds from their legitimate purpose.  It was stated in the last report that the extra fund of the Insti-  tution, which had been saved from the accrued interest, was invested  in State Stocks. This investment was made because the fund was at  the time drawing no interest, and because, until action could be pro-  cured by Congress in relation to receiving said fund into the United  States Treasury, it was deemed the safest disposition of the money.  Though a temporary depreciation of these stocks took place during  the last year, there is no reason to regret the investment. Their  marketable value is at present about the same as it was at the time  they were purchased.  By reference to the report of the Executive Committee it will be  seen that the expenditures during the year, though less than the  amount of receipts, have somewhat exceeded the estimates. This has  been occasioned, first, by unexpected repairs which were found neces-  sary to the building, in consequence of an unprecedented hail storm,  which destroyed several thousand panes of glass and did considerable  injury to the roof and other parts of the edifice ; secondly, by an  expansion of the system of foreign exchanges, rendered necessary by  the large amount of material entrusted to the Institution by the   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15  different agricultural and other societies of the country ; and thirdly,  the necessity we were under, on account of the financial pressure, of  paying bills for publications which will appear during the present  and the next year. The funds of the Institution are, however, still  in a prosperous condition, but great care is required to prevent the  accumulation of small expenses, which, individually, by reason of  their insignificance, are allowed to occur, but which in the aggregate,  at the end of the year, are found to have swelled into amounts of  considerable magnitude.  Publications. â€” The ninth annual quarto volume of Contributions to  Knowledge was completed and distributed during the first half of the  year. It is equal in size and importance to the preceding volumes,  and contains the following memoirs :  1. On the relative intensity of the heat and light of the sun upon  different latitudes of the earth. By L. W. Meech.  2. Illustrations of surface geology, by Edward Hitchcock, LL.D.,  of Amherst College.  Part 1. On surface geology, especially that of the Connecticut  valley, in New England.  Part 2. On the erosions of the earth's surface, especially by  rivers.  Part 3. Traces of ancient glaciers in Massachusetts and Ver-  mont.  3. Observations on Mexican history and archa3ology, with a special  notice of Zapotec remains, as delineated in Mr. J. Gr. Sawkins' draw-  ings of Mitla, &c. By Brantz Mayer.  4. Eesearches on the Ammonia Cobalt bases. By Professor Wol-  cott Gibbs and Professor F. A. Genth.  5. New tables for determining the values of the co-efiicients in the  perturbative functions of planetary motion, which depend upon the  ratio of the mean distances. By J. D. Kunkle.  6. Asteroid supplement to new tables for determining the values of  h- and its derivatives. By J. D. Eunkle.  It was stated in the last report that Mr. L. W. Meech proposed to  continue his interesting investigations relative to the heat and light  of the sun, provided the Smithsonian Institution would pay the ex-  pense of the arithmetical computations. Though most of his time is  necessarily occupied in other dutieSj he would cheerfully devote his  leisure hours to the investigation with a view of extending the bounds   16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  of knowledge. During the past year an appropriation lias been made  of one hundred dollars for the purpose here mentioned, and we are  assured, from what Mr. Meech has already accomplished, that this  sum will be instrumental in producing valuable results. He proposes  to determine, from several elementary formulas, the laws of terres-  trial temperature for different latitudes. The first formula has been  pretty thoroughly applied, and the annual temperature computed by  it compared with the result of actual observation. The diurnal  temperatures have also been deduced and seem to agree with actual  observation within the presumed errors of the latter. The temper-  ature, however, of the surrounding medium, defived from the annual  temperature, differs widely from the results obtained by the diurnal  temperatures. The author is inclined to attribute this difference to a  defect in the law of radiation as generally received, which, deduced  from experiments in the laboratory, he thinks inapplicable to the  phenomena of terrestrial temperature. The second formula takes into  account another cause of the variation of temperature, namely, the  cooling due to the contact of the air ; and the third formula includes  also the effect of the absorption of solar heat in its passage through  the atmosphere. The investigation will include the consideration of â€”  1st, terrestrial radiation ; 2d, contact of air ; 3d, the sun's intensity ;  4th, atmospheric absorption ; 5th, the difference in radiating power of  luminous heat by day and non-luminous heat by night. Among  other inferences to be deduced is the relative heating or radiating  powers of sea and continent, when the land is covered with foliage  and vegetation, and when it is covered with ice and snow. These  researches are intimately connected with the extended series of obser-  vations on the climate of the United States, now carried on at the  expense and under the direction of the Institution.  The paper of Professor Gibbs and Dr. Genth, which forms a part of  the 9th volume, has been republished in the American Journal of  Science and in the London Chemical Gazette, due credit being given  to the Smithsonian Contributions, from which it was copied. We  regret to be informed by the authors of this interesting paper that  the sum appropriated by the Institution for assisting in defraying the  expense of the materials and apparatus employed in their researches  was scarcely sufficient to compensate for more than one-fourth of their  outlay. Limited means, and not a want of proper appreciation of the  labors of these gentlemen, prevented their entire reimbursement for  the pecuniary loss in the prosecution of their valuable researches.  They intend, notwithstanding this, to continue their investigations,   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17  and to devote as much time to them as their other engagements and  the means at their disposal will allow. Since this memoir has met  the approval of the scientific world, it will be proper to make as  liberal an appropriation as the demands on the limited income of the  Institution will permit for the continuance of researches in the same  line. The publication of the paper was of comparatively little  expense, since it required no costly illustrations, and this may be an  additional reason for granting a larger appropriation for further in-  vestigations in the same line.  The ninth volume also contains the supplement to the tables by J.  D. Runkle, mentioned in the last report. The tables in this supple-  ment are intended to facilitate calculations with reference to the  asteroids. The search for these bodies has been prosecuted with so  much vigor of late that their list now extends to more than fifty, and  the mechanical labor required to calculate their places is so great that  this can scarcely be expected to be accomplished, except by the use of  general tables. The work of Gauss on the theory of the motion of  the heavenly bodies leaves little to be desired, so far as the deter-  mination of their orbits is concerned ; but this is by no means the  case with regard to their perturbations by the larger planets. The  tables therefore will afford an important means of facilitating the ad,  vance of our knowledge, particularly of this class of the members of  our solar system.  The third part of the Nereis Boreali- Americana, by Dr. Willip^m H.  Harvey, has been completed and will be included in the tenth volume  of the Contributions. Two hundred extra copies of the text of the  preceding parts having been struck off before the distribution of the  types, and the drawings on the lithographic stones having been pre-  served, an equal number of plates from the latter have been printed  and colored, so that we shall be enabled to make up two hundred  copies of the complete work to be offered for sale, which will serve,  it is hoped, to reimburse, in some degree, the heavy expense incurred  in the publication of this interesting addition to the science of botany.  It may be proper to mention that the work was published in numbers,  in order that the whole expense should be defrayed by tlie appro-  priation of different years, as well as to furnish the author the oppor-  tunity of rendering the work more complete by more extended re-  search.  For the purpose of classification, the sea plants have been grouped  2 s   18 EEPOET OF THE SECEETARY.  under three principal heads which are readily distinguished by their  general color.  They are as follows :  1. Melanospermea3 â€” plants of an olive-green or olive-brown color.  2. Ehodosperme^e, or plants of a rosy-red or purple color.  3. Chlorospermea3, or plants of a grass, rarely of a livid purple  color.  The numbers of the work already published relate to the first two  divisions, and the third, now about to be issued, will contain the last,  with an appendix describing new species discovered since the date of  the former parts.  The text of the first part of the work on Oology, mentioned in pre-  ceding reports, has been printed ; but the publication of the plates to  accompany it will be so expensive that we were obliged to defer it  until the present year. In the meantime the author will proceed with  the preparation of the other parts of the memoir, and the whole will  be completed as soon as the funds of the Institution will permit.  From an accidental oversight in the preparation of the last Eeport, I  neglected to mention the fact that the author of this interesting work  is Dr. Thomas M. Brewer, of Boston. The omission of his name in  the reports would not only be unjust to himself, but might also pre-  vent him from receiving in some cases additional information relative  to his labors from correspondents who are engaged in the same line of  research. The announcement of the fact of the intended publication  of this memoir has induced a number of persons to enter into corre-  spondence with the Institution on the subject, and we doubt not that  these remarks will tend to call forth other additioxis to our knowledge  of this branch of natural history.  Since the date of the last Report a grammar and dictionary of the  Yoruba language of Africa have been accepted for publication. Thi  work is another contribution from the missionary enterprise of the  present day, and has been prepared by the Eev. Thos. J. Bowen, of  the Southern Baptist Missionary Board, from materials collected  during a residence of six years in Africa, and revised and rewritten with  the aid of W. W. Turner, esq., of Washington. The grammar and  dictionary are prefaced by a brief account of the country and its inhab-  itants. The long residence of the author in this part of the interior  : of Africa has enabled him to gather more minute knowledge of its  topography, climate, and productions, and of the political, social, and  moral relations of its inhabitants than has before been obtained. He   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19  lias collected interesting information as to the habits of thought and  action of the people, and their capacity for moral and intellectual  culture, which would have escaped the casual notice of the mere  traveller.  Yoruba is a country of Western Africa, situated to the east of  Dahomey, and extending from the Bight of Benin, in a northerly  direction, nearly to the Niger. It is between the countries explored  by the distinguished travellers,, Barth, on the north, and Livingstone,  on the south. The author describes it as a beautiful and fertile region,  densely inhabited by a population devoted to agricultural pursuits,  who do not dwell on the lands they cultivate, but live clustered  together in villages and towns, some of which contain from 20,000 to  70,000 inhabitants. The people are generally of a primitive, simple  and harmless character, and governed by institutions patriarchal  rather than despotic. In their appearance they resemble the Cau-  casian race, while their mental powers and general moral impulses  are considerably advanced in the scale of intelligence. They have,  indeed, already attained no inconsiderable degree of social organiza-  tion, while they have escaped some of the more depraved incidents of  an advanced civilization.  The language, which is said to be spoken by about two millions of  people, is represented by Professor Turner to be very homogeneous in  its structure, almost all of it being derived from some five hundred  primitive words. \"Its articulations are sufficiently easy to imitate,  and there is a system of vocalic concords recurring through the whole,  which^ together with the multiplicity of vowels, renders it decidedly  euphonious. The great difficulty is found in the tones and accents,  which can be discriminated only by a good ear, and must be uttered  correctly to make the speaker intelligible. The Yoruba has neither  article nor adjective, properly so called, and it is almost wholly des-  titute of inflection. The verbal root remains unchanged through all  the accidents of person, mood, and tense, which are indicated by  separate pronouns and particles. The plurality of nouns is also indi-  cated by the aid of a plural pronoun. The numerals are based on the  decimal system, yet many of them are formed by subtraction instead  of addition or multiplication, as with us. Thus 15 is literally 10 -f- 5 ;  but 16 =r 20 â€” 4, 17 = 20 â€” 3, &c. Although this language is spoken  by a rude people, it abounds in abstract terms, and the missionary  finds no difficulty in expressing in it the ideas he desires to com-  municate.\"   20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  It is believed that this work will be received by the student of  ethnology as an interesting addition to this science, and that its pub-  lication will not only facilitate the labors of the missionary, but be  productive of valuable commercial results. The country in which the  language is spoken is rich in natural and artificial productions, and  as the inhabitants are anxious to establish relations of trade with  other parts of the world, it would seem to offer a new and tempting  field to mercantile enterprise.  Under the head of publications, we may allude to the Appendix to  the Annual Report of the Eegents. Previous to 1853 this report was  in a pamphlet form, and only in one or two cases were a few extra  copies ordered. Since that date an annual volume has been presented  to Congress, of which twenty thousand extra copies have been printed.  The liberal distribution of this work has met with general approbation,  the applications to the Institution for copies have been constantly in-  creasing, and, in connexion with the Report of the Patent Office, no  document has become more popular or is better calculated to advance  the cause of knowledge among the people. The object is, as far as pos-  sible, to distribute this volume among teachers, and through them to  diffuse precise scientific knowledge to the rising generation. It is made  also the vehicle of instruction, in the line of observations, to all who  are desirous of co-operating in the investigation of the natural history  and physical geography of this country. The wide distribution of this  report has tended, more than any other means, to make known the  character of the Institution, and to awaken an interest throughout  the whole country in its prosperity.  In order to render the series complete, the first volume â€” that for  1853 â€” contained a reprint of the previous reports of the Secretary,  from which a connected history of all the operations of the Institution  from the beginning may be obtained. These volumes are illustrated  by a large number of wood cuts, which have been provided at the  expense of the Smithsonian fund. We have, however, to regret that,  from the rapidity with which Congressional documents are hurried  through the press, we have not been allowed in all cases revised copies  of the proof. We cannot, therefore, be held entirely responsible for  inaccuracies of the press any more than for the style of printing or  the quality of the paper.  It is a part of the settled policy of the Institution to appropriate  its funds, as far as the original law of organization will allow, to  such objects only as cannot as well be accomplished by other means ;  and accordingly, in several instances, the printing of papers previously   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21  accepted for publication has been relinquished because it was subse-  quently found that the works could be given to the public, under  certain conditions, through other agencies. In such cases the favor-  able opinion expressed by the Institution as to the character of the  work, or the assistance rendered by the subscription on the part of the  Kegents, for a number of copies to be distributed in exchange for  other books among our foreign correspondents, has been sufficient to  induce some liberal minded parties to undertake the publication,  rather as an enterprise connected with the reputation of their estab-  lishments, than as a matter of profit. / â€žâ– .  Among the works of this class is the \"Theofy~of the Motion of the  Heavenly Bodies,\" by the celebrated Gauss, translated by Captain C.  H. Davis, U. S. N., late superintendent of the Nautical Almanac,  which was originally accepted by us for publication, but was after-  wards relinquished to Messrs. Little & Brown, of Boston, who have  shown in this instance, as well as in others of a similar character, a  liberality which cannot be otherwise than highly appreciated by a  discerning public. This book, which is essential to the advance of  practical astronomy, was published in Latin, in Hamburg, in 1809,  and is now of difficult access, as well as of restricted use, on account  of the language in which it appeared. It gives a complete system of  formulas and processes for computing the movement of a body revolv-  ing in an ellipse, or in any otuer curve belonging to the class of conic  sections, and explains a general method of determining the orbit of a  planet or a comet from three observations of the position of the body  as seen from the earth. The essay was called for at the time it was  produced by the wants of science. The planet Ceres, discovered on  the first day of the present century by Piazzi, of Italy, had been  lost to astronomers in its passage through the portion of the heavens  illuminated by the beams of the sun, and could not be found by the  means then known, when Gauss, from a few observations of its former  place, calculated its orbit, and furnished an ephemeris by which it  was readily rediscovered. The methods employed in this determina-  tion were afterwards given in a systematic form in the work now  translated. The copies subscribed for by the Institution, on account  of exchanges, and those paid for by the Navy Department, for the  use of the computers of the Nautical Almanac, were sufficient to  secure the publication of the work, which could not have been under-  taken without these aids.  In accordance with the same policy the Institution has subscribed  for a few copies of a work on ' ' The Pleiocene Fossils of South Caro-   22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  lina,' ' by M. Tuomey and F, S. Holmes. This work received the com-  mendation of some of the distinguished members of the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, at its meeting in Charles-  ton, in 1850, and its publication was undertaken at the risk and cost  of the authors. The actual expense, however, far exceeded their esti-  mate, and without the liberal aid of the legislature of South Carolina  they could not have escaped heavy loss, or been enabled to complete  the work in a proper style of art. To aid the same enterprise the  Institution was induced to make the subscription above mentioned for  copies to be distributed to foreign societies. We regret to state that  before the work was fully completed the science of the country was  called to mourn the loss of Professor Tuomey, of the University of  Alabama, who, during the past year, was prematurely snatched away  from his family and friends in the flower of his age. His works,  however, will remain as an inheritance to the cause of knowledge and  the best monument to his memory. We have been gratified to learn  that, at the late session of the legislature of South Carolina, a resolu-  tion was passed authorizing a continuance of the patronage of the  State to the publication of these researches, and consequently Professor  Holmes has signified his intention to publish two additional volumes  on the Eocene and the Post Pleiocene Fossils, to which the subscrip-  tion of the Institution will also be extended.  Another work, belonging to the same class, is the series of \" Contri-  butions to the Natural History of the United States of America,\" by  Professor Louis Agassiz. It has been mentioned in a previous report  that this distinguished savan was preparing a series of j^apers to be  presented to the Smithsonian Institution, and that the plates for some  of these had been engraved. But the number of these contributions,  and the cost of their illustration, would have absorbed a larger portion  of the Smithsonian fund than could have properly been devoted to  the labors of one individual. Fortunately, however, the reputation  and popularity of Professor Agassiz have enabled his friends to i^ro-  cure subscribers for an independent work, containing the result of his  valuable investigations, in numbers unprecedented in the annals of  science of this or of any other country. In order to assist this enter-  prise in the beginning, and to relieve its own funds, the Institution  subscribed for copies, to be distributed among foreign libraries, in ex-  change for rare works of a similar character, with which to enrich its  own library.  The Institution has also facilitated the researches described in the  first two volumes of the work in question, and I may quote the   EEPORT OF THE SECEETARY. 23  following sentence containing the acknowledgment of the author for  the services which have thus been rendered him : \" Above all, I must  mention the Smithsonian Institution, whose officers, in the true spirit  of its founder, have largely contributed to the advancement of my  researches by forwarding to me for examination not only all the  specimens of Testudinata collected for the museum of the Institution,  but also those brought to Washington by the naturalists of the dif-  ferent parties that have explored the western Territories, or crossed  the continent with the view of determining the best route for the  Pacific railroad. These specimens have enabled me to determine the  geographical distribution of this order of reptiles with a degree of  precision which I could not have attained without this assistance.\"  Besides this, the Institution caused special collections of turtles to be  made for Professor Agassiz, from those parts of the country from  which no specimens had previously been obtained.  It was originally intended, as announced in the prospectus, to issue  one volume a year, but the author found that the first volume was  insufficient to contain all the matter which he had designed to give  in it. Its publication was therefore delayed, that the whole of this  part of his general subject might be presented at once, and hence two  volumes have been issued together. The large subscription which  has been obtained has enabled the publishers to extend the original  plan, and to expend a much greater sum on the engravings than was  at first thought possible. The work will serve to increase and extend  the reputation of the illustrious author, as well as to afford a striking  example of the liberality of our country and its growing appreciation  of abstract science.  Under the head of publications, and in justice to the memory of a  distinguished naturalist, a profound scholar, and a worthy man, the  late Dr. Gerard Troost, of Tennessee, it ought to be stated in this  Eeport, that after his death, several years ago, a memoir he had pre-  pared on the organic remains known as Crinoidea^ illustrated by a  collection of specimens, was presented to the Smithsonian Institution  for publication. It was submitted to two naturalists of high reputa-  tion, and found by them to be an important addition to knowledge,  though left by its author in an unfinished condition. The gentlemen  to whom it was referred generously offered to supply the deficiencies,  and to prepare the work for the press. Their engagements, however,  have since been such as to prevent up to this time the completion of  the task which they undertook to accomplish. One of the gentlemen   24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  to whom the paper was referred, Prof. James Hall, in whose posses-  sion the specimens now are, states that he had hoped long since to  put the memoir in such a form as to do justice to the memory of Dr.  Troost, and bo in accordance with the latest views of the subject. To  do this, however, required an examination of other specimens, and for  this object he had never been able to find time. At present he is  engaged in a geological report of Iowa, in which there are several  plates of Crinoids, and any which may be identical with those de-  scribed by Dr. Troost will be accredited to him. We regret exceed-  ingly this long delay in the publication of the labors of one so highly  esteemed in life and gratefully remembered in death. It has, however,  been caused by circumstances over which we had no control, and which  have given us considerable disquietude.  The new and extended series of Meteorological and Physical Tables,  which has been in course of preparation for several years, is at length  completed and ready for distribution. It forms a volume of 634 large  octavo pages, which may be divided into separate parts, each distinct  in itself. A copy of these tables will be sent to each of the meteoro-  logical observers, and it is believed that a considerable number may  be sold in this country and Europe, from which something may be  derived towards compensating the author, Prof. Guyot, for the un-  wearied labor and attention he has bestowed upon the work.  At the request of the Institution, Baron Osten Sacken, of the Eus-  sian legation, who has made a special study of Dipterous Insects has  prepared a catalogue of the previously described species of this con-  tinent, analogous to that of Melsheimer's catalogue of the Cleoptera  of the United States, which was published some years ago by this  Institution.  It frequently happens that the same animal is described by different  naturalists under different names, and there may be among the species  enumerated in this catalogue some of this character, but in the pre-  sent state of the knowledge of American Diptera the publication of a  complete synonymical catalogue is impossible. Yet a list like the one  just completed is an indispensable preparatory work for the future  study of this branch of entomology. The catalogue includes the  species inhabiting not only the North American continent in general,  but also those in Central America and in the West Indies. It also  gives the principal localitiee where each species has been found.  In a list like this, says the author, completeness is the principal  merit ; the symmetrical arrangement is but of secondary importance.   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25  The groups adopted by Meigen and Wiedemann are retained, avoiding  the subdivisions introduced by modern authors.  The publication of this list, we trust, will very much facilitate the  study of entomology, and it is a special object of this Institution to en-  courage individuals to devote themselves to particular subjects of re-  search. The field of nature is so extended that unless it be minutely  subdivided, and its several parts cultivated by different persons, little  progress of a definite character can be anticipated. To collect the  materials for wider generalizations_, microscopic research is necessary  in every direction, and men enthusiastically devoted to one object are  required in every branch of knowledge in order that the whole may be  perfected. It is true, before entering on an investigation of this kind,  that it is desirable for the individual to have a general knowledge of the  different branches of science, since they are all intimately connected ;  and the student can then narrow his field of view until it comes within  the scope of his mental abilities, or the means which he may have at his  disposal for its advancement. As a general rule, however, the ability  to enlarge the bounds of science can only be obtained by almost ex-  clusive devotion to a few branches.  It is scarcely possible to estimate too highly, in reference to the  happiness of the individual as well as to the promotion of knowledge,  the choice in early life of some subject to which the thoughts can be  habitually turned during moments of leisure, and to which observa-  tion may be directed during periods of recreation, relative to which  facts may be gleaned from casual reading, and during journeys of  business or of pleasure. It is well that every one should have some  favorite subject of which he has a more minute knowledge than any  of his neighbors. It is well that he should know some one thing  profoundly, in order that he may estimate by it his deficiencies in  others.  In this connexion it may be proper to remark that the association  of individuals in the same community^ each with a special and favor-  ite pursuit^ each encouraging the others, each deferring to the others,  and each an authority in his own specialty, forms an organization  alike valuable to the individual, the community, and the public gen-  erally. To induce and encourage the establishment of such associa-  tions is one of the objects of the Institution. It is suprisiog what  interest may be awakened, what amounj^ of latent talents developed,  and what dignity imparted to the pursuits of a neighborhood by a  society in which the knowledge of each becomes common property,   26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  and the labors of each one are stimulated by the appreciation and  applause of his fellows.  I am acquainted with no plan of adult education better calculated  to elevate the mental character of a community or to develop the  local natural history of a district than that of a well organized and  efficiently conducted association of this kind. Such establishments,  I am happy to say, are now becoming common in every part of the  United States. They have taken the place, in many cases, of the de-  bating societies, which were formerly instituted for mental improve-  ment. To the latter it might justly be objected that they tend to  promote a talent of sophistical reasoning, rather than to engender an  uncompromising love of truth. The habit of fluent speaking may  undoubtedly be cultivated at the expense of profound thought, and  however j^romotive at times of the temporary interests of the indi-  vidual, can never be supposed to tend to the permanent advancement  of the species.  Meteorology. â€” The system of meteorological observations under the  direction of the Institution and the Patent Office has been so repeatedly  described in previous reports that it will scarcely be necessary to give  any more at this time than an account of the present state of the work.  The system was commenced in 1849, and has since then been gradually  improving in the number of observers, character of the instruments,  and the precision with which the records are made. The Institution  has awakened a wide interest in the subject of meteorology, and has  diffused a considerable amount of information with regard to it which  could not readily be obtained through other means. The manufac-  ture of instruments, compared with standards furnished b)^ the Insti-  tution from London and Paris, has been an important means of  advancing the science. The work is still continued by James Green,  173 Grand street, New York, and during the past year an increasing  number of full sets has been purchased by observers. The Institution  has continued to distribute rain-gages, with which observations are  now made on the quantity of aqueous precipitation in nearly every  State and Territory of the Union.  We are indebted to the National Telegraph line for a series of  observations from New Orleans to New York, and as far westward  as Cincinnati, Ohio, which have been published in the '' Evening  Star,\" of this city. These reports have excited much interest, and  could they be extended further north, and more generally to the  westward, they would furnish important information as to the ap-   KEPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 27  proacli of storms. We hope in the course of another year to make  such an arrangement with the telegraph lines as to he ahle to give  warning on the eastern coast of the approach of storms, since the  investigations which have been made at the Institution fully indicate  the fact that as a general rule the storms of our latitude pursue a  definite course.  The materials which have been collected relative to the climate of  the North American continent are as follows :  1st. A miscellaneous collection of MSS. and other tables relative to  the climate of the United States. This series will be enriched by a  reference list to all the meteorological records, which are to be found  in the extensive library of Mr. Peter Force, of this city, and other  accessible sources of information.  2d. The observations made under the direction of this Institution  since 1849.  3d. A series of observations made by Dr. Berlandier in Mexico.  4th. Observations made in the British possessions.  5th. The record of observations made by government and other  exploring expeditions.  6th. Copies of the observations made under the direction of the Sur-  geon General at the military posts.  7th. Copies of the observations made at the expense of the States  of New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maine, and Missouri.  8th. A series of observations from Bermuda and the West Indies.  Besides these, the Institution is endeavoring to obtain, by means of  its exchanges, a full series of all observations which have been made  in foreign countries, and to form a complete meteorological library.  Complaint has been made on account of the delay in publishing  deductions from the materials which have thus been collected, but,  with the limited means of the Institution, it should be recollected that  all objects enumerated in the j^rogramme of organization cannot be  simultaneously accomplished. The reductions have been steadily pur-  sued for the last five years, and all the funds, not otherwise absolutely  required, have been devoted by the Institution to this object.  It will be a matter of astonishment to those not j^ractically ac-  quainted with the subject, to be informed as to the amount of labor  required for the reduction of the returns made to this Institution for  a single year. During 1856 the records of upwards of half a million of  separate observations, each requiring a reduction involving an arith-  metical calculation, were received at the Institution. Allowing an  average of one minute for the examination and reduction of each   28 REPORT OP THE SECRETARY.  observation, the amount of time consumed will be nearly 7,000 hours,  or, at the rate of seven hours per day, it will be 1,000 days or up-  wards of three years, or, in other words, to keep up with the reduction  of the current observations the whole available time of three expert  computers is required. This is independent of the labor expended in  the correspondence, preparation and distribution of blank forms, and  the deduction of general principles. The work has been prosecuted,  therefore, as rapidly as the means at the disposal of the Institution  would jjermit. Since the arrangement was made with the Patent  Office, from twelve to fifteen persons, many of them females, have  been almost constantly employed, under the direction of Prof. Coffin,  in bringing up the arrears and in reducing the current observations.  All the materials collected at the Institution are in the process of  being arranged and bound in accessible volumes, with proper indices,  to be used by all who may be desirous of making special investigations  on any point relative to the climate of this country.  During the past year the reductions for 1855 were printed in  pamphlet form and distributed to observers for criticism and sug-  gestions as to improvements which might be adopted in the subse-  quent publication of the entire series.  Exchanges. â€” The system of international exchange has been carried  on during the past year with unabated zeal, and we trust with undi-  minished good results. A large amount of scientific material has  passed through our hands in its transfer to and from societies and  individuals in this and other countries. The returns made to the  Institution during 1857 for its own publications consist of 555 vol-  umes, 1,067 parts of volumes, and 138 charts. These works embrace  most of the current volumes of scientific transactions, and are of the  highest importance as aids in original research. The number would  be very much increased if the contents of several large cases, which  were accidentally delayed until the beginning of this year, were in-  cluded.  The importance of the exchanges is not to be estimated by the com-  mercial value alone of the books received. In addition to this we  must consider the effect which it produces in bringing into immediate  communication the cultivators of literature and science in this country  with those abroad, of distributing among our societies publications of  a class, the existence of which would scarcely otherwise be known,  and of facilitating the diffusion of knowledge which, by the ordinary  modes of transmission, would not be attained, except, perhaps, in the  course of years.   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29  The system has now attained a great development, and increases  measurably every year. The expenses hitherto have been principally  borne by the Institution, but their amount has now become so great  as seriously to interfere with other operations, and I therefore think  it advisable that a charge be made, to the parties receiving a certain  amount of packages annually, sufficient to reimburse some of the  outlay, of the Smithsonian funds. \"What would not be felt by each  one individually would, in the aggregate, materially lessen the burden  of expense connected with this part of the operations, which amounted,  in 1857, to about $3,000.  The expenses of the Smithsonian exchanges would be considerably  greater than they are but for the liberality of various transportation  companies in carrying packages free of cost. No charge on freight is  made by the United States Mail Steamship Company, the Panama  Railroad, or the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, forming the mail  line from New York to San Francisco, while the agents of the line  in these two cities, Messrs. I. W. Eaymond and A. B. Forbes, serve  the Institution in various ways. The California Express Agency  of Wells, Fargo & Co., has also acted with the greatest liberality,  and the same should be stated of the old line of Bremen and New York  steamers. None of the domestic agents of distribution â€” namely. Hick-  ling, Swan & Brewer, of Boston; D. Appleton& Co., New York; J. B.  Lipi^incott & Co., Philadelphia; John Russell, Charleston; B. M.  Norman, New Orleans ; Dr. Wislizenus, St. Louis ; H. W. Derby,  Cincinnati ; and Henry P. B. Jewett, of Cleveland â€” make any charge  for services ; and the same may also be said of Messrs. Oelrichs &  Liirman, of Baltimore.  The amount of labor involved in the exchanges is, of course, very  great, as will be readily inferred from an examination of the tables  of receipts and transmissions during the past year, given by Professor  Baird. The entries in the several record books fill over 700 pages ;  the circulars, invoices, and acknowledgments, exceed 4,300, in addi-  tion to over 600 receipts for packages. For a detailed account of all  the operations of the exchanges I would refer to the accompanying  report of Professor Baird.  Explorations, researches, d'c. â€” It was stated in the last report that  the magnetic instruments belonging to the Institution were given in  charge of Baron Miiller, for investigations in Mexico and Central  America. Two series of records of observations have been received,  but for nearly a year past nothing further has been heard from the  expedition. We should regret the loss of the instruments, although   30 RE POET OF THE SECRETARY.  the cost of them has been more than repaid by the services they have  rendered to science in the Arctic expedition under Dr. Kane, and in  the results which have already been obtained from them in Mexico.  The self-registering apparatus in the observatory on the Smithso-  nian grounds, established at the joint expense of the Coast Survey  and the Institution, has continued to record the variations in the  horizontal direction of the magnetic force during a considerable por-  tion of the past year. The interruptions which have taken place have  been principally caused by the impurities of the city gas, the exhala-  lations from which have interfered with the photographic process.  The records obtained, however, will furnish valuable data for study-  ing, in connexion with similar observations in other parts of the  globe, the character of the magnetic force, and to assist in determin-  ing how far the changes are merely local, or to what extent they  affect the whole earth.  Laboratory. â€” During the past year the laboratory has been under  the charge of Dr. E. W. Hilgard, recently appointed State geologist  of Mississippi. Among others, a series of experiments was made by  him, under direction of the Secretary, at the expense of the Navy  Department, relative to the vapor from a modification of bi-sulphuret  of carbon as a substitute for steam applied to mechanical purposes.  The result of these investigations was unfavorable to the substitution  of this material in the way proposed. Although a greater amount of  pressure is produced at the same temperature than in the case of  steam, yet the amount of work relative to the absolute quantity of  heat employed is by no means in accordance with this, the density of  the vapor and its greater specific heat require a corresponding amount  of fuel^ and when we consider the fact that the bi-sulphuret of carbon  is not a natural but a factitious substance, of which the vapor, when  combined with air, is highly explosive and extremely ofiensive on  account of its odor and the greater complexity of the engine required  for its use, its application in the place of steam would be far from  advantageous.  Another series of investigations was conducted in the laboratory  relating to the prevention of counterfeiting bank notes, particularly  by photography ; but as this was intended especially for private use,  the expenses were paid by the parties interested.  The Institution does not consider it a part of its duty to volunteer  an opinion as to the practicability of the new projects with which the  public mind is frequently agitated ; but when directly called upon by  the government or other parties of influence to pronounce a judgment   REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 31  on any point of practical or applied science, it does not shrink from  the responsibility, but, after diligent and cautious inquiry, gives the  conclusions, whatever they may be, at which it has arrived.  Library. â€” Extensive alterations are in the process of being made in  the wing of the building appropriated to the library, for the better  accommodation of the bocks. The shelving has been arranged in two  stories of alcoves, thereby more than doubling the space. Each lower  alcove is separately secured by a door ; a precaution which has been  found necessary in the library of the Institution as well as in that of  Congress. It is a fact to be regretted, but which it is necessary to  mention in order to vindicate the restrictions imposed upon an indis-  criminate access to the books, that there is in some quarters a lamentable  want of honesty with regard to the use of property of a public character.  Not only are works in many cases mutilated, merely to avoid the labor  of copying a few pages, but valuable sets are sometimes broken by  actual theft.  The appropriation for the library must not alone be measured by  the sum assigned for the \" cost of books ;\" it must be recollected that  the library is principally increasing by means of the exchanges ; that  every year the Institution sends abroad, besides all the public docu-  ments which it can procure, some hundreds of copies of the quarto  volumes of its transactions, the marketable value of which is several  thousand dollars. It therefore ought to be distinctly understood that  the library is constantly increasing by the addition of the most valuable  series of the transactions of literary and scientific societies in all parts  of the world, and that this is at the expense of what are denominated  the active operations of the Institution. It is true the number of  books directly purchased is comparatively small, but indirectly pro-  cured in the way stated the annual addition is valuable.  Among the numerous donations received during the past year it is  of course impossible in this report to particularize more than a few  of the most important. The Academies of Science of Vienna, St.  Petersburg, and of Brussels, have all contributed largely both of their  older and more recent issues. The Eeal Sociedad Economica, of  Havana, has been particularly liberal in this respect, furnishing nearly  complete series for many years back, as have also the Horticultural  societies of Paris and Berlin. The most extensive single gift during  the year has been that of the Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles, in  72 volumes, and the Histoire Naturelle des Mammirfees, of Buflfon  and Daubenton, in 15 volumes, from the Herzogliche Bibliothek der   32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  Friedensteinsclien Sammlnngen, Gotha. The Britisli Admiralty has  contributed a full set of all the charts published by it during the year.  We may also mention, as an object of special interest of this class, a  valuable set of historical maps, presented by Justus Perthes, the  celebrated geographical publisher of Gotha, exhibiting the political  condition of Europe from the beginning of the third century down to  the time of the crusades. The limits of the several empires are ex-  hibited by different colors, and the whole are on such a scale as to  be adapted for instruction in schools or academies. To render this  interesting work more generally known in this country, it is proposed  to exhibit the maps in the reading room and to translate and print  the pamphlet of explanations for the use of the visiters to the Insti-  tution.  Among the curiosities of the library received during the past year  the most prominent is an ornamental album, presented through the  Department of State, from Miss Contaxaki, a native of the isle of  Crete. This work was designed as a contribution to the universal  exhibition at Paris in 1855, where it received a diploma for the artistic  merit displayed in its execution. The \" Classical Bouquet,\" as it is  called, consists of illustrations of the principal monuments and places  in Greece, to which are added a few from the author's native isle of  Crete. These illustrations are accompanied by quotations from the  most illustrious Greek authors, beautifully illuminated, while many  of the pages are adorned with pressed flowers culled from the places  which the drawings represent. The book itself is a large quarto,  covered with blue velvet heavily embroidered, and lettered with silver.  It is inclosed in a case, made of olive wood of the country, about a foot  and a half square, richly carved and ornamented with appropriate  devices. This work was transmitted to the United States through  Charles C. Spence, esq., and affords a favorable specimen as well of  the present state of the arts in that country, which was the birthplace  of the true and the beautiful, as of the talents, the taste, and the un_  wearied industry of the lady who devised and principally executed it.  The library possesses an extensive collection of pamphlets, in-  cluding the separate theses of the candidates for graduation or honors  at the German universities ; also a series of the annual reports of the  public institutions and societies in this country. During the past year  these have been classified, a large number of them bound, and the  remainder arranged in pasteboard boxes, labeled and placed on the  shelves as volumes.   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33  The binding of the books received through exchange continues to  be a large item of expense, and we have devoted the renaainder of the  appropriation for the library, not expended in the purchase of books  or for clerical service, to this object.  In relation to the books received by the copyright law, I have but  little to say in addition to what has been stated in preceding reports.  The provisions of the act are still disregarded, to a considerable extent,  by the larger publishers, and, as a general rule, works are received of  but little value in themselves and inconsistent with the character of  the library of the Institution. Though the cost of postage has been  diminished by the law of Congress authorizing the free transmission  of copyrights, yet it has by no means exempted the Institution from  a large item of expense on this account. The publishers frequently  inclose witliin the packages letters relating to the proper direction of  the certificates and other matter pertaining to the copyright, and by  a decision of the Post Office Department all such communications are  charged with letter postage. Though the sum in each case appears  insignificant, yet in the aggregate it may amount, in the course of a  year, to several hundred dollars ; and since the system from the begin-  ning has been of no real benefit to the Institution, we have addressed  a circular to each publisher who forwards a copyright and neglects to  pay the postage on the accompanying letters, apprising him of the fact.  In conclusion, I may state that though the copyright law was un-  doubtedly intended to enrich the library of the Institution, yet the  non-compliance with it of some of the principal publishers, and the  reception of a large amount of worthless matter involving expense in  its transportation and care has entirely defeated this object. The cost  of the system has been at least ten times greater than the value of the  books received ; nor is this all ; a compliance with the act has constantly  subjected the Institution to unmerited censure. We have therefore  been a loser both in funds and in the friendly feeling of an influential  portion ofthe community, and it is to be hoped that Congress will, at  its present session, essentially modify the existing law. The deposit  of a single copy of each article in the Patent Office, instead of the  three now sent to Washington, would be sufficient to secure the  rights of the author, and answer all the objects of a complete collec-  tion of this class of American publications.  Museum. â€” The general plan and objects of the collections which  have been assiduously formed through the agency of the Smithsonian  3s   34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  Institution have been given in several of the preceding reports, and it  will be sufficient, at this time, to repeat that they are intended to  exhibit the distribution and development of the plants and animals, as  well as to illustrate the geological and mineralogical character of the  North American continent. The number of specimens required for  these purposes is great, since all the varieties from every locality re-  quire attention. During the past year specimens have been collected  by ten government expeditions and six private exploration parties.  Some of the returns from these are now on the way, and will greatly  enhance the number and value of the materials before received. Ac-  cording to the statement of Professor Baird, hereto appended, the  catalogued specimens of animals at the end of the year 1857, amount-  ed to: mammals, 3,200; birds, 8,766; skeletons and skulls, 3,340;  reptiles, 239 ; fishes, 613.  During the year several persons have availed themselves of the use  of the collections and library in the prosecution of original researches^  and, as usual, several government expeditions, which have been scntout  for surveys, the construction of roads and for military purposes^ have  been provided with instructions as to the mode of collecting specimens  and observing meteorological and other natural phenomena. No oppor-  tunity of adding to our store of information, in regard to the physical  geography and natural history of the western portion of this continent,  has been suffered to pass without being improved, and I may safely  say, that since the establishment of the Institution more has been  done to ascertain and make known the character of the less inhabited  portion of our continent than all which had been previously accom-  plished in this line. The survey of routes from the Gulf of Mexico  to the Pacific has served of late to add much to our knowledge of  Central America, and during the past year the British government  has sent out a party for the exploration of the country north of the  limits of the United States and between the great lakes and the Pacific  ocean. This survey^ in connexion with that along the 49th parallel of  latitude, now in progress for determining the boundary line between  the United States and the British possessions, will add to the natural  history of the northern portion of our territory, and will furnish the  data necessary to delineate more accurately the great mountain  system which determines the climate and physical peculiarities of the  western portion of tliis continent.  SmitJison' s personal effects. â€” The bequest of James Smithson included  all his personal effects, and these were obtained by Hon. Eichard Kush^   REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. oO  tiie agent of the American government, tlirougli wliom tlie legacy was  procured. They were delivered by him to the Secretary of State, and  afterwards deposited in the museum of the Patent Office, where they  remained until the last year, when they were transferred to the Regents'  room in the Smithsonian building. They have been arranged for exhi-  bition in a large case of black walnut, and now form an interesting por-  tion of the collections of the Institution. They consist of a very ex-  tensive series of rare though minute specimens of mineralogy, of the  table service of plate of Smithson, and of the portable chemical and  mineralogical apparatus with which he made his investigations.  Besides the above mentioned articles, the Institution has had in its  possession for several years the library of Smithson, containing 115  volumes, and a collection of manuscripts, principally consisting of what  would appear to be the materials of a philosophical dictionary. The  whole collection taken together serves to exhibit the character of the  man, and clearly to indicate his intention as to the nature of the Insti-  tution to which he gave his name. It serves to strengthen the convic-  tion, if anything of this kind were needed, that the proper interpretation  of the will has been given by the Regents in adopting the plan which  makes active operations, the discovery of new truths, and a diffusion  of these among men, the prominent object of the establishment.  In this connexion, it may be interesting to repeat a statement made  in a former report_, that the Institution is in possession of two like-  nesses of Smithson ; one, a portrait of him while a youth, in the cos-  tume of a student at Oxford, the other a medallion, from which a steel  engraving has been executed. The first was purchased from the widow  of John Fitall, the servant of Smithson, and the other was among his  effects, and identified by a paper attached to it, on which the w^ords  \" my likeness\" were written in Smithson's own hand. A list of the  papers published by Smithson^ and a record of all the facts which  could be gathered in relation to him, have been made, to serve here-  after for a more definite account of his life and labors than has yet  appeared.  Gallery of Art. â€” During the past year this apartment of the Smith-  sonian building has been enriched by a faithful copy, in Carrara  marble, of the \" Dying G-ladiator,\" one of the most celebrated statues  of antiquity. This copy, which is said to be the only one in marble  in existence, has been deposited here by its owner, F. W. Risque,  esq., of the District of Columbia, to whom the public of this country  is indebted for his liberality in the purchase and free exhibition of so   36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  costly and interesting a specimen of art, It is by Joseph Gott, an  English sculptor of high reputation, and its faithfulness, as a repre-  sentation of the original, is vouched for by a certificate, among others,  from our lamented countryman, Thomas Crawford.  The Stanley collection of Indian portraits, which is still in the  Gallery, has, during the past year, been increased by a number of  new pictures, and continues to be an object of interest to the visitors  of the national capital. This collection, now the most extensive in  existence, of Indian portraits, ought, as we have stated in previous  reports, to be purchased by government. It is a sacred duty which this  country owes to the civilized world to collect everything relative to  the history, the manners and customs, the physical peculiarities, and,  in short, all that may tend to illustrate the character and history of  the original inhabitants of North America. The duty which Mr.  Stanley owes to his family will not permit him to retain the collection  unbroken, and unless Congress make an appropriation for its pur-  chase, he will be obliged to dispose of it in portions. Such an event  would be a lasting source of regret; and, from the interest which a  number of distinguished members of the Senate and House of Eepre-  sentatives have expressed in regard to the purchase, we doubt not  that the proposition will in due time be favorably entertained.  Lectures. â€” During the past season the usual number of lectures  has been given, without any diminution in the size of the audience  and the apparent interest of the public.  In connexion with this subject, we may mention, complaints have  frequently been made against the Institution, on account of the bad  cocdition of the walks leading to the building ; but it should be recol-  lected that the grounds belong to the government and are not under  the control of the Eegents. A plank walk has, however, been laid  df'wn along the principal thoroughfare and lighted, on nights of lec-  tures, at the expense of the Institution.  The Smithsonian lecture-room is found to be the most commodious  apartment in the District for public meetings, and almost constant  applications are made for its use. This is granted in all cases, pro-  vided the actual expense of lighting, heating and attendance be paid,  and the object for which it is required be consistent with the character  of the Institution, and not merely intended to advance individual  interests. The rule which excludes from the lectures any subject  connected with sectarianism, discussions in Congress and the political  questions of the day, has been strictly observed.   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37  The following is a list of the lectures which were delivered during  the winter of 1857-'58 :  Seven lectures hy Professor John LeConte, of the South Carolina  College, on '' The Physics of Meteorology.\"  One lecture by Hon. H. W. Hilliard, of Alabama, on the \"Life  and Genius of Milton.\"  Two lectures by Dr. I. I. Hayes, of Philadelphia, on \" Arctic Ex-  plorations.\"  One lecture by Rev. T. J. Bowen, of Yoruba, Africa, on \" Central  Africa â€” the Country and People.\"  One lecture by D. K. Whitaker, esq., of Charleston, S. C, on the  '' Genius and Writings of Sir Walter Scott.\"  Two lectures by Professor C. C. Felton, of Harvard College, Cam-  bridge, Mass., on \" Modern Greece.\"  Four lectures by Dr. James Wynne, of New York, on the \" Dara-  tion of Life in Various Occupations.\"  Three lectures by Professor J. P. Espy, on \" The Law of Storms.\"  Five lectures by Rev. J. H. Mcllvaine, of Rochester, N. Y., on  \"Comparative Philology in some of its bearings upon Ethnology,  and embracing an account of the Sanscrit and Persian Arrowhead  Languages.\"  Three lectures by G. Gajani, on \" The Catacombs, the Coliseum, and  the Vatican of Rome.\"  One lecture by Professor Scheie de Vere, of the University of Vir-  ginia, on \" John Law and the Celebrated Mississippi Speculation.\"  From the foregoing \"' statements we think it will be generally  acknowledged that the Institution is steadily pursuing a course of  usefulness well calculated to make the name of its founder favorably  known and the results of his bequest highly appreciated in every  part of the civilized world, that its funds are in a good condition, and  that the prospect of its future influence in the promotion of know,  ledge is even more cheering than at any period of its past history.  Respectfully submitted.  JOSEPH HENRY,  Stcretary S. I.  Washington, January, 1858.   APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,   S.MITHSONIAN iNSTITFnON,  Washington, December 31, 1857.  Sir : I have tlie honor, herewith, to present a report, for 1857, of the  operations you have entrusted to my charge, namely, those which re-  late to the printing, to the exchanges, and to the collections of natural  history.  He.-^pectfully suomitted.  SPENCER F. BAIRD,  Assistant Secretary Smithsonian Institution.  Joseph Henry, LL.D.,  Secretary Smithsonian Institution.   Publications.  The puhlications of the Institution for the year consist of the ninth  volume of Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, embracing 484  pages of quarto text and 22 plates, and of the annual report to Con-  gress, an octavo volume of 468 pages. Considerable progress has  also been made with the printing of the tenth volume of Smithsonian  Contributions, 136 pages and five plates being finished.  The catalogue of North American Diptera, by Baron Ostensacken,  is nearly through the press and will include 112 octavo pages.  Exchanges.  The system of international exchanges so successfully prosecuted by  the Institution since its establishment has been carried on during the  year with the happiest results. A large amount of scientific material  has passed through its hands and has been promptly transmitted to  its destination. The general details of the system will be presented  hereafter.  The returns made to the Smithsonian Institution for its own dona-  tions wiU be found in the following table:  A. â€” Beceipt of hooks, &c., hy exchange in 1857.

In the followin*^ tables are exhibited the chief statistics of exchange  during both 1856 and 1857. The last annual report did not fully  cover the subject, owing to the fact that a supplementary sending was  required in January, 1857, to complete that of July, 1856, and a re-  port for 1856 could not reasonably include what was actually not per-  formed till the ensuing year. In presenting the series of tables  throughout, those of transmissions for 1856 are to be uuderstood as  embracing parcels forwarded in January 1857. This will explain the  apparent disproportion in amount for the two years, as much of what  was sent in the beginning of 1857 would otherwise not have gone until  the ensuinsr summer.   B.

DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM OF EXCHANGES.  As the system of international exchange now carried on by the  Smithsonian Institution has attained a very great development, a  sketch of the mode of conducting it may not be amiss at the present  time. The subject may be considered under two heads, one relating  to the parcels received from parties in the United States for transmis-  sion to foreign countries, and the other having reference to receipts  from abroad for institutions and individuals in America. In con-  nexion with this subject, it may be stated that a large room in the  Institution, measuring 70 feet by about 25, is devoted to the depart-  ment of exchanges, and, besides containing the stock on hand of  Smithsonian publications and of miscellaneous documents, is fitted up  on one side with a series of large binns, each one devoted to a partic-  ular portion of the world, and appropriately labelled. The floor of  the room is occupied by a series of long tables, five feet wide, on which  parcels are made up or unpacked. Printed addresses are arranged in  small pigeon holes, and include nearly all the correspondents of the  Institution, domestic and foreign, amounting, at the present time, to  nearly one thousand names.  Operations connected toith ty-ansmissions from the United States. â€” The  transmissions of the Smithsonian Institution are regulated, in a mea-  sure, by the time when the annual volume of Smithsonian Contribu-  tions is completed. One or two months before this time, a circular  letter of advice is transmitted to all the institutions and individuals  in the United States and the Canadas known or supposed to have  a desire to avail themselves of the facilities of the Smithsonian sys-  tem of exchanges, and the conditions stated upon which parcels will  be received. If any society or individual have published a work  likely to be of interest to the scientific and literary world abroad, and  no indication is given of an intention to distribute copies, a special  application is made for them, and no effort left untried to secure to  the foreign investigators the benefit of all original and useful Ameri-  can material. Such appeals are generally responded to very favor-  ably, and very many })ublications of the different bureaus of the gov-  ernment, of States, and of State agricultural and historical institutions,  of societies, and of individuals, have thus been obtained.  In nearly all cases, in the first instance, at least, the Smithsonian  Institution is called on to furnish lists of suitable foreign recipients  for the publications just referred to, or the volumes are sent in bulk,  to be addressed here. After the first sending, the exchange is usually  more directly between the parties corresponding, the Institution pre-  ferring to have the parcels properly addressed before forwarding to  Washington. In all cases great care is taken to secure the credit of  the donation to the proper party, and to prevent it being supposed to  come directly from the Institution.  To facilitate the selection of suitable recipients for donations or ex-  changes, the Institution publishes once in two years a carefully pre-  pared list of foreign institutions for general distribution. The last  one issued contains over 570 names, but manuscript additions bring   EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 45  the number up to about 700. The list of individuals is nearly as large  as that of institutions.  To facilitate the selection of recipients for particular works, of which  a limited number of copies only may be available for distribution,  classified lists of institutions are kept, as of academies of science gene-  rally, and of societies devoted to special subjects, as geography, ge-  ology, zoology, botany, ethnology, statistics, &c., and these are ar-  ranged from IS^o. 1 upwards, in the order of relative importance, or of  equable distribution among the centres of learning; thus six copies of  any work on hand would be assigned to the first six names on the list  of institutions most interested in it.  The parcels, as received irom the different portions of North Amer-  ica, are placed, after being addressed, (if not so alread}^) in their ap-  propriate receptacles, and the list entered specifically in a record book.  To facilitate such entry, a detailed invoice of each transmission is re-  quired, and the failure to furnish it puts the institution to the great  trouble of making it from the books themselves.  When the parcels have all been received, a list of the different do-  nors is printed, together with the titles of the various works which  the institution has for distribution at the time. On the da.y assigned  for commencing the labor of making up the packages, the binns are  emptied successively, the contents arranged carefully on the counters,  so as to bring everything for one address together, the Smithsonian  donations are added, and each particular piece is checked off in the  printed blank just referred to. This rough invoice is numbered and  handed to the packers, who make up the volumes into one or more  bundles, and mark them with the number of the invoice, by which  means they are easily identified and labelled. When parcels or books  are addressed to individuals, these are usually inclosed in the bundles  of the societies to which they belong, the number and addresses of  such sub-packages being marked on the rough invoices. A correct copy  is made of these lists, and forwarded by mail or otherwise to the par-  ties, in which is also stated the nature and time of the transmission.  These invoices are finally posted, to the debit of the party addressed,  in a large ledger, which shows what each has had, and what return  has been made to the Institution, The record of each package is,  therelbre, made four times.  In sending the invoice of the package for each address, a circular  is added explaining the objects of the transmission, and the conditions  on which the exchange will be continued.  The time occupied in invoicing and making up the packages varies  with the occasion, although a month is usually required to finish the  work. After the bundles are all made up, those tor each agent are  brought into one heap, and they are then packed into boxes, a check  list being kept of the numbers placed in each box.  There are three principal agents in Europe who have charge of the  Smithsonian exchanges in their respective regions : Dr. Felix Fltigel,  resident in Leipsic, has charge of continental Europe, with the ex-  ception of France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, (which are supplied by  Hector J3ossange, of Paris,) and of Greece and Turkey. Henry  Stevens, of London, is agent for Great Britain and Ireland. Greece   46 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SKCRETARY.  and Turkey are usually readied through the American minister at  Constantinople and the consul at Alexandria. Most of the points in  Asia and Africa are supplied through the Presbyterian Board of For-  eign ^Missions in New York, and the American Board in Boston,  Australia through Mr. I. W. Kaymond, of New York, and South  America through a variety of channels.  The boxes for the agents above mentioned, containing the different  parcels, are then sent from the Institution ; those for Dr. Fliigel being  shipped from Baltimore, through Oelrichs & Liirman, direct to Bre-  men, thence by railroad to Leipsic. The boxes for Messrs. Bossange  and Stevens are shipped by packet from New York.  The governments of Europe to whose ports shipments are made by  the Institution have all authorized their admission free of duty, on  filing an invoice with the customs authorities some time in advance of  the arrival of the boxes. After being received by the agents, these  boxes are unpacked, and the different parcels distributed to their desti-  nation through the channels selected by the intended recipients, accom-  panied by circular advices from the agents. In Germany the parcels  are usually transmitted through the booksellers of Leipsic, as they  may have occasion to send to correspondents in the various towns.  Exchanijes from foreign countries for America. â€” The system of ope-  rations in this case is similar in principle to that just described,  although the steps take place in inverse order. The packages are sent  to the agents of the Institution, who inclose them in boxes, which are  forwarded monthly, or oftener. On being received in Washington  they are unpacked, an entry made of their contents, and the parcels  placed temporarily in the binns assigned to their respective addresses.  They are then assorted, those for each party made up into one bundle,  and thus forwarded, by express or otherwise, accomj)anied by a blank  receipt, which is to be signed and returned.  MUSEUM.  A. â€” Increase of the Museum.  The collections in natural history received during the year 1857  have been of great extent, and embrace many important additions to  the material on hand for extending the knowledge of the animal,  vegetable, and mineral productions of America. The specimens  received have been from the usual variety of sources ; the most im-  portant being, as heretofore, those brought in by the different govern-  ment expeditions, as follows :  1. Survey of the northwestern boundary line, Archibald Campbell,  esq., commissioner. â€” The expedition left in April, 18H7, for Puget  Sound, and during the year had its main camp for the most part at  Simeahmoo bay, near the mouth of Frazer's river. Large collections  of the animals and plants of the Sound have been made by Dr. Ken-  nerly, surgeon and naturalist of the expedition ; and of minerals and  fossils by Mr. George Gibbs, the geologist.   HEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 47  2. Exploration of the Black Hills and Loup Fork, under Lieutenant  G. K. Warren, U. S. A â€” Lieutenant Warren made his third visit to  the Upper Missouri and Yellowstone region, accompanied, as on pre-  vious expeditions, by Dr. Hayden as geologist and naturalist. Very  large collections in all branches of natural history were made and  brought home, tending, in great measure, to complete our knowledge  of the distribution of species over the high plains of the west.  3. Wagcn road to Bridger' s Pass, under Lieutenant F. T. Bryan, U.  S. A. â€” During his second year's work on this road to Utah Territory,  Lieutenant Bryan, as before, was accompanied by Mr. Wm. S. Wood,  who continued and completed the collections of the preceding year, in  securing many species not previously obtained. Dr. Wm. A. Ham-  mond, U. S. A., who accompanied the party as surgeon, also made a  separate and independent collection of much interest, not only on the  route, but while stationed at Fort Eiley. In this he was for a time  assisted by Mr. J. Xantns de Vesey.  4. Wagon road to California via South Pass, under Wm. 31. 3Ia-  graio. â€” This party, accompanied by Dr. James G. Cooper, as surgeon  and naturalist, aided by C. Drexler, reached Fort Laramie during the  autumn. The collections in all departments were large and import-  ant, and were accompanied by copious notes on the species observed.  5. Survey of the southern boundary of Kansas, under Lieutenant  Colonel Johnston, U. S. A. â€” A valuable collection of specimens in  alcohol was made during the survey by J. H. Clark, esq., astron-  omer of the expedition.  6. Survey of the Isthmus of Darien, under Lieutenant N. 3Iichler, U.  S. A. â€” This expedition, accompanied by Mr. A. Schott and Messrs.  Wm. S. and Charles Wood, sailed for Carthagena in October, pro-  ceeding thence to the isthmus. While at Carthagena a collection of  birds and shells was made and sent to Washington, and others are on  their way.  Among government expeditions fitted out in 1857, but from which  no collections have yet been received, are the following :  7. Wagon road route to California via El Paso and Fort Yuma,  under Colonel Leech. â€” This expedition was accompanied by Dr. McCay  and Mr. Hays, both of whom were prepared to make collections in  natural history.  8. Exploration of the La Plata and its tributaries, under Captain  Page, V. S.N. â€” Christopher Wood doing duty as zoological collector.  9. Artesian well exp)edition, on the Llano Estacado, under Captain  Pope, U. S. A. â€” This is the third expedition to the sterile regions of  western Texas, conducted by Captain Pope.   48 EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.  10. Exploration of the Colorado river, under Lieutenant J. G. Ives.â€”  This expedition started in September, accompanied by Dr. J. S.  Newberry, surgeon and geologist, and H. B. MoUhausen, artist and  zoologist. Stveral collections made by these gentlemen about San  Diego are on their way_, but have not yet been received.  The more important private explorations from which specimens  have been received are as follows :  11. Region around Fort Tejon, California, hy J. Xantus de Vesey. â€”  The collections made by Mr. Vesey will compare favorably with any  obtained under government auspices, and embrace complete series of  the animals and plants of the vicinity of Fort Tejon, as far as met  with ; they also include quite a number of new species.  12. Southern Illinois and Northern Red river, hy R. Kennicott. â€” Mr.  Kennicott, under a commission from the Northwestern University, at  Evanston, Illinois, to procure for its museum a collection of specimens  of the natural history of the northwest, visited southern Illinois in the  spring, and after exploring the vicinity of Cairo and New Madrid  for several months, proceeded to the Red river of the North, within  the British possessions, and nearly to Lake Winipeg. The collections  made cover all branches of zoology.  13. Coast of Florida, hy G. Wurdemann, United States Coast  Survey. â€” Mr. Wurdemann's collections were in continuation of those  of previous years, and included a great variety of species, among them  several birds new to the fauna of the United States.  14. Red river of the North and of Nelson's river, U. B. Territory,  hy Donald Gunn, esq. â€” A large collection of birds and mammals made  in these regions by Mr. Gunn, assisted by Mr. John Isbister, have  added much to our knowledge of the distribution of species.  A collection of about 150 species of birds of Arctic America, Mexico,  and Guatemala, presented by John Gould^ esq., of London, has fur-  nished very important data for comparison and determination of species  of the United States.  Of the numerous ether collections made it is impossible to give an  account here. The detailed list of contributions and donations will,  however, furnish additional information on the subject.  In conclusion it may be proper to state, that of the government expe-  ditions mentioned above, that under Mr. Campbell was organized by  the State Department ; those under Lieutenant Warren, Lieutenant  Bryan, Colonel Johnston, Captain Pope, and Lieutenant Ives, by the  War Department ; those under Mr. Magraw and Mr. Leech, by the De-  partment of the Interior ; and those under Captain Page and Lieu-  tenant Michler, by the Navy Department.  In the reception of collections from the California coast, the Institu-  tion is under great obligations to the California Mail Steamship  Line, composed of the United States Mail Steamship Company, the   REPORT OP ASSISTANT SECRETARY.   49   Panama Railroad Company, and the Pacific Steamship Company, as  also to Messrs. Wells, Fargo, Co., for free transportation of very many  boxes and packages. The expense of what has been thus received, if  charged for at the usual rate, would have been entirely beyond the  means of the Institution, and if in an unprecedentedly short time our  knowledge of the natural history of California has been carried to a  point fully equal to that of any of the older States_, it is unquestionably  owing in very great measure to the liberality of the companies above  mentioned in so generously seconding the efforts of the Institution.  The folloioing table exhibits the additions made to the record books of the  museum in 1857, in continuation of previous years:    1851.   1852.   1853.   1854.   1855.   1856.   1857.

The remarks in the last annual report of the Institution in relation  to the richness and extent of its collections are strengthened by the  additions of the past year, and they are confidently believed to be  beyond competition in the field of American zoology. The precise  statistics cannot now be given for the different classes and orders, as  the cataloguing is not yet completed. In one department, however,  some idea of the facts may be realized by the statement, that on the  first of July, 1857, the Institution possessed â€”  Species.  Of skins or alcoholic specimens of North American mammals 20.'>  Of skins or alcoholic specimens of South American mammals 18  Of skins or alcoholic specimens of European mammals 60  283  Of skulls or skeletons of North American mammals 221  Of skulls or skeletons of South American mammals 17  Of skulls or skeletons of European mammals 48  2S6   This was entirely exclusive of Cetacea, Pinnipedia, Cheiroptera and  Quadrumana, of which there were many species. Since the first of  July, the number of species of all orders has received a large increase.  The species of North American mammals in the museum of the In-  stitution, not mentioned in the great work of Audubon and Bachman,  exceeds 80. Of birds, the North American species are believed to ex-  ceed 600 ; of reptiles, 400 ; of fishes, probably 800 or more. As all  these classes are in process of elaboration, accurate statistics can  probably be presented in the next report.  4 s   50 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.   Work done in the museum.  The systematic registration of the Smithsonian collections has been  carried on as rapidly as other duties would admit. The number of  species labeled and entered during the year amounted to 5,271 ; most  of them in three dijS'erent series of records, making nearly 15,000 entries.  It may be proper to state that all collections, as received, are entered in  a general record book, of which the alphabetical list of donations ap-  pended to this report is a trau script. The different specimens are  next labeled and then entered on the record for the class, or particular  order, and from this posted in a ledger consisting of separate sheets,  one for each species, systematically arranged, and each sheet contain-  ing an enumeration of all the specimens of its species, with the lo-  calities, sex, date, measurements and other memoranda, making the  third time of writing out the name and statistics. In this way not  only can information be obtained of the number of species of each class  or order, but also of the separate specimens, with the locality and gen-  eral character of each one. The posting up is complete for the mam-  mals, birds, and osteological specimens, and well under way for the  reptiles and fishes, and some orders of invertebrates.  During the past year the general report on the mammals of the  Smithsonian collection has been completed and printed, forming volume  VIII of the Report of the Pacific Railroad Survey. That on the birds  is far advanced, and will be finished in the course of the ensuing  year, which will also, it is hoped^ witness the completion of reports  on the reptiles and fishes.  Distribution and use of the Smithsonian collections.  As in previous years, the Smithsonian specimens have been freely  used by students and investigators in natural history, in preparation  of Monographs and other researches. Duplicates have also been dis-  tributed to a considerable extent, and as the collections become better  arranged and other circumstances allow, it is hoped to make such  distribution on a very extensive scale.

The estimated expenditure amounted to $34,000, the actual ex-  penditure to $35,149 16. The excess is due to unexpected repairs,  necessary to the building in consequence of a very severe hail  storm, which broke several thousand panes of glass, and otherwise  injured the edifice ; and to the payment of the last unsettled account  contracted by the architect for the gas pipes and fixtures.  The expenditures, however, are less than the income for the year,  leaving a total balance now in the hands of the Treasurer of $10,341 30.  Of this sum^ $5,000 are the remainder of the extra fund, ($125,000,)  intended to be permanently invested, and the whole is at present re-  quired for carrying on the operations of the Institution, until the  receipt of the next semi-annual income.  During the past year, the stocks purchased by the Institution tem-  porarily declined in commercial value, but they are now selling at  about the same prices as those at which they were bought. Fluctua-  tions, however, of this character do not affect the income of the Insti-  tution, since the amount of interest continues permanently the same.  The committee respectfully submit the following estimate of the  receipts and expenditures for the year 1858 :  Receipts.

The building of the Smithsonian Institution having been completed,  the special object of the Building Committee for which it was originally-  appointed, might be considered accomplished, and therefore an annual  report no longer necessary ; but as a large portion of the edifice re-  mained unfinished, and since repairs are required which will probably  be very expensive, it is thought proper that the committee should be  continued.  At the last session of Congress an appropriation of fifteen thousand  dollars was made for cases for the accommodation of the collections  belonging to government. These are now finished and form a beauti-  ful addition to the large hall, and are apparently well adapted to the  purpose for which they are intended. With strict economy the appro-  priation of Congress has been found sufficient to provide accommoda-  tions for the present reception of the articles, though in the course of  time additional cases will be required.  The west wing of the building, devoted to the library, has been  furnished with alcoves and a gallery extending around three sides of  the large room. This arrangement, which will serve very much to  increase the accommodation and security of the books, produces a  very pleasing architectural efiect.  The large cisterns in the grounds near the building, which were  directed to be arched over at the last session of the Board, have been  properly secured, and one of them converted into an ice-house.  The balance of a bill for gas fixtures, which had been contracted by  the architect, and which remained unsettled, on account of a disagree-  ment as to certain charges, has been finally paid, after a reduction of  1352 99.  The peculiar style of architecture of the building, and the large  amount of surface it exposes to the weather, renders constant repairs  necessary. During the past year almost the whole time of two work-  men has been occupied in this service.  Eespectfully submitted.  RICHAED RUSH,  WM. H.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day at 11 o'clock  a. m.  Present : Hon. R. B. Tanej, Chancellor, Hon. John C. Breckin-  ridge, James M. Mason, S. A. Douglas, Gen. Jos. G. Totten, Prof.  A. D. Bache, Wm. B. Magruder, and the Secretary.  The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.  The Chancellor, Chief Justice Taney, then presented the following  communication :  Washington, 3Iarcli 16, 1857.  Gentlemen : When the Board of Regents was originally organized  it was deemed proper that the Vice President of the United States for  the time being should be elected as the Chancellor. The Institution  exists under the authority of Congress, and they have made certain  officers of the government ex officio Regents. The Vice President is  the highest in rank of the officers thus designated ; and it would seem  to be peculiarly proper that the one who presides over the delibera-  tions of one branch of the national legislature should also preside over  the deliberations of a scientific institution which the nation has brought  into existence and fosters.  Unfortunate events have for some time past left the government  without a Vice President elected by the people. And when that office  was vacant the Regents conferred on me the office which had always  before been filled by the Vice President. And when I accepted it I  regarded the appointment as a temporary one. The reason for the  appointment has now happily ceased, and I desire to give the Regents   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 73  an opportunity of restoring the original plan of organization, in which  I fully concurred when it was adopted.  I therefore resign the office of Chancellor of the Institution, and at  the same time return my thanks for the honor which the Eegents  bestowed upon me in electing me to that office.  But my resignation will not lessen the interest I feel in the Insti-  tution. On the contrary, every year's experience has more and more  convinced me of its usefulness and efficiency in promoting the objects  of its founder, and I shall always be ready to offer my humble aid if  I can be useful in advancing its prosperity and success.  I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, your obedient  servant,  E. B. TANEY.  To the Eegents of the Smithsonian Institution.  Mr. Breckinridge, Vice President of the United States, moved that  the present Chancellor, Chief Justice Taney, be re-elected to that  office, expressing his unwillingness to assume the position which had  been so long and so ably filled by its present occupant.  The motion was adopted unanimously, whereupon Judge Taney  remarked that he was anxious to serve the Institution to the best of  his ability, and he could not decline this expression of the confidence  of the Board if they insisted on his retaining the office of Chancellor.  The Secretary announced that, by joint resolution of the Senate and  House of Eepresentatives, Hon. Eichard Eush, of Pennsylvania, and  Gen. Joseph Gr. Totten, of the city of Washington, had been re-elected  Eegents for six years ; also that the President of the Senate had re-  appointed Hon. James A. Pearce and Hon. James M. Mason, Eegents  for the same period of time.  The Secretary announced to the Board that, since its last meeting,  three distinguished men of science, correspondents of the Institution,  had deceased, namely : Prof. J. W. Bailey, Dr. E. K. Kane, and  Mr. W. C. Eedfield.  On this announcement Prof. Bache offered a series of appropriate  remarks, referring to their eminent services in the promotion of  science.  Gen. Totten offered the following resolutions, which were adopted :  Resolved^ That the Eegents of the Smithsonian Institution have  heard with regret the announcement of the death of Prof, Jacob W.  Bailey, whose communications to the Smithsonian Contributions have   74 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS.  attracted the notice and won the approval of naturalists throughout  the world.  Besolved, That the Regents offer to the family of Prof. Bailey their  condolence on the loss which they have sustained.  Mr. Douglas offered the following resolutions, which were adopted :  Besolved, That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, in  common with the whole country, have heard with deep regret of the  death of one of their esteemed collaborators. Dr. E. K. Kane, to whom  was committed by this Institution a set of philosophical instruments  for the purpose of research in the polar regions, which he used, and  carefully returned at the hazard of his life, with a series of obser-  vations of great value to science.  Resolved, That the Regents offer to the family of Dr. Kane their  condolence on the loss which they have sustained.  Prof. Bache offered the following resolution, which was adopted :  Resolved, That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution have  heard with regret of the decease of their valued correspondent, William  C. Redfield, of New York, whose labors in meteorology have ren-  dered his name familiar to men of science in every part of the civilized  world, and offer to his family their condolence on the loss which  they have sustained.  A communication from Dr. Robert Hare was read, relative to the  practical construction of minute weights and measures.  On motion of Dr. Magruder, the following resolutions were adopted:  Resolved, That a copy of the communication of Dr. Hare be trans-  mitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, with the recommendation of  the Board of Regents that the instrument offered by Dr. Hare be  received by the government, and placed in the Office of Weights and  Measures.  ^ Resolved, That the communication of Dr. Hare be inserted in the  appendix to the report of the Regents to Congress.  A communication from J. A. Johnson, esq., of Maryland, relative  to an \"International Geographic and Scientific Commission\" was  read and referred to the Executive Committee and the Secretary.  The Secretary made a communication to the Board, relative to an  article which had been published by Prof. S. F. B. Morse, containing  charges against his moral character and his scientific reputation.  The Chancellor made a few remarks, confirming Prof. Henry's  statement as to the advice he had given him respecting this attack.  On motion of Mr. Mason, the following resolution was adopted :  Resolved, That the communication of the Secretary and accompany-   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 75  ing documents be referred to a committee, to examine and report upon  it at the next session of the Board of Regents.  Whereupon the Chancellor appointed Messrs. Mason, Pearce, Felton,  and Douglas as the committee.  The Board then adjourned sine die.   Washington, January 20, 1858.  In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the  Smithsonian Institution, fixing the time of the beginning of their  annual meeting on the third Wednesday of January of each year, the  Board met this day in the Regents' room.  No quorum being present, the Board adjourned to meet on Thurs-  day, January 28, 1858.  THURSDAY, January 28, 1858.  A meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day at 10 a. m.,  in the Smithsonian Institution.  Present : Hon. John C. Breckinridge, Vice President of the United  States, Hon. J. M. Mason^ Hon. S. A. Douglas, Hon. George E.  Badger^ Prof, A. D. Bache, Prof. C. C. Felton^ Mr. Seaton, Treasurer,  and the Secretary.  In the absence of the Chancellor the Vice President was called to  the chair.  The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.  The Secretary stated that, since the last meeting of the Board, the  Speaker of the House of Representatives had appointed Hon. William  H. English, of Indiana, Hon. Benjamin Stanton, of Ohio, and Hon.  L.J. Gartrell, of Georgia, as Regents for the term of their service as  members of the House.  The Treasurer presented a statement of the receipts and expendi-  tures during the year 1857^ and also a general statement of the funds;  which were referred to the Executive Committee.  The following communication was presented :  Washington, January 23, 1858.  Gentlemen : The undersigned offers for sale, and respectfully sug-  gests to your honorable Board the propriety of purchasing, the gallery  of Indian portraits now, and for some years past, in the Smithsonian  Institution.   76 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  He proposes to sell the whole collection described in the catalogue  published by the Institution, one hundred and fifty-two in number ?  for the sum of twelve thousand dollars â€” one-third of the same cash  and the remainder at'two equal annual instalments ; or, if it should  be preferred, one-fourth down and the residue in three equal annual  instalments.  The undersigned commenced his labors in this work in 1842, and  devoted the best years of his life in travelling through the region of  our country peopled principally by the red man â€” through the wilds  of Oregon and what is now Washington Territory. All of the por-  traits are accurate likenesses of prominent chiefs and braves, and  readily recognized by men who have had intercourse with the various  tribes of Indians.  Since 1852 he has cherished the hope (but has not been able to  realize it) that Congress would authorize the purchase of this collec-  tion. He has J up to this time, made sacrifices â€” such as one believing  in the merit of his own work, and whose zeal in persevering through  arduous and unremitting toil to accomplish it, alone would make â€” to  keep this collection together. He will not affect the modesty of  refraining from expressing his belief that no other gallery (aside from  what artistic merit the public may award it) possesses the interest,  in a national point of view, that this does. Some of the chiefs repre-  sented are no longer living ; and_, to the little we know of their history  it will be some satisfaction to add the perpetuation of their features.  These were taken from life and in the character they themselves pre-  ferred to be handed down to the gaze of future generations.  The price at which he offers this collection will not more than cover  the outlay in cost of material, transportation, insurance, travelling  expenses, &c., and will not afford him any compensation for his time  and labor. Taking, as he humbly conceives, the intrinsic .value of  these Indian portraits into consideration, he will receive no pecuniary  profit by their disposal on the terms named.  His ardent desire that they should be preserved, as a national work,  in some place at the capital of our country ; his failure heretofore to  induce Congress to agree to their purchase, and the more pressing  reasons of liabilities now maturing, impel him to make this proposi-  tion. Your honorable Board are again requested to consider it and  communicate your answer at as early a day as is convenient. If the  purchase of the portraits is not authorized by you, he will be com-   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 77  pelled to expose them at public auction in time to liave tlie proceeds  available by the Ist of May next.  The undersigned will take this occasion to tender his acknowledg-  ments to the Board and Professor Henry for the use of the hall in the  Institution where the gallery now is, and for other courtesies, which  he will always appreciate.  I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,  J. M. STANLEY.  The Hon. Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.  On motion, this communication was referred to a special committee,  and Messrs. Felton, Douglas, and Badger were appointed.  The Secretary laid before the Board a present from Miss Contaxaki,  of Greece, consisting of a volume of drawings, &c., illustrating the  celebrated works of art in her own land, together with the following  letters :  Washington, November 23, 1857.  Sir : During my last trip to the east I was charged by Miss Eliza-  beth B. Contaxaki, a native of the isle of Crete, with an '' ornamental  album,\" which she desired me to present, through you, to the Smith-  sonian Institution. In forming the work, this lady designed it as a  contribution to the Universal Exhibition at Paris, in 1855, worthy of  the classic renown of the ancient city of Athens. So ardent is her  admiration of the United States and its institutions that she wishes  it to be permanently placed in this country, and having a high appre-  ciation of you as an American statesman, and your reputation as a  classical scholar, she desired that I would request you to offer it in  her name to the Smithsonian Institution.  The \" Classical Bouquet/' as it is entitled, consists of illustrations  of the principal monuments and places in the kingdom of Greece, to  which are added a few from her native isle of Crete, not yet emanci-  pated from the Moslem yoke. These illustrations are explained by  quotations from the ancient Greek authors in the original language,  beautifully illuminated ; whilst many of the pages are adorned with  flowers culled from the spots which the drawings represent.  Miss Contaxaki is the sole originator and authoress of it, assisted  in its execution by native artists of Greece. The beauty of the finish,  and the faithfulness and accuracy of the quotations from Hesiod,  Homer, Xenophon, Plato, and others, show that the present sons and   78 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS.  daughters of the renowned ancient city of Minerva are not insensible  of the glory that was once attached to her name, nor incapable of  appreciating those monuments of art, science, and literature which  still survive.  Feeling assured that^ as an eminent classical scholar, you will fully  appreciate the worth of the Classical Bouquet, I beg to present it,  through you, to the Smithsonian Institution, in her name.  With sentiments of the highest respect, I remain your obedient  servant,  CHAS. S. SPENCE.  Hon. Lewis Cass,  Secretary of State.  Washington City, November 25, 1857,  Sir: I send you herewith a splendid album, together with a letter  from Mr. Spence, explanatory of the circumstances of its execution  and transmission to this country. I perform the duty of presenting it  to the Smithsonian Institution with great pleasure, for it is a finished  specimen of taste and art, worthy of a prominent place in your inter-  esting collection. Mr. Spence has so well described it that any  further reference to it on my part is unnecessary.  I am, dear sir, respectfully yours,  LEWIS CASS.  Prof. Henry,  Smithsonian Institution, Washington City.  On motion, the work was referred to Professor Felton, to report a  resolution expressive of the high appreciation of the gift on the part  of the Board, and a letter of acknowledgment to M iss Contaxaki.  A letter was read from Sir George Simpson, expressing the desire  and intention of the agents of the Hudson's Bay Company to co-  operate with the Smithsonian Institution in procuring sj)ecimens of  natural history, and in the prosecution of scientific researches.  The Board then adjourned to meet on Saturday, 30th instant, at 11  o'clock, a. m.  SATUPvDAY, January 30, 1858.  The Board of Regents met this day in the hall of the Institution  at 11 o'clock a. m.  Present : Hon. J. C. Breckinridge, Vice President of the United  States, Hon. J. A. Pearce, Hon. J. M. Mason, Hon. S. A. Douglas,  Hon. W. H. English, Professor A. D. Bache, Professor C. C. Felton,  Mr. Seaton, Treasurer, and the Secretary.   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 79  The Vice President took the chair.  The minutes were then read and approved.  The minutes of the last meeting of the \"Establishment\" were read  for information, according to the by-laws of that body.  The Secretary stated to the Board the action of Congress at its last  session relative to the construction of cases in the Smithsonian  building for the gov^ernment collections, and also the decision of the  Attorney General respecting the law.  The Secretary then presented the annual report of the operations,  expenditures, and condition of the Institution during the year 1857 ;  which was read.  The Board then visited the rooms of the building, the collections,  &c., and adjourned.  Washington, April 10, 1858.  The Board of Regents met this day at 11 o'clock a. m.  Present: Hon. J. M. Mason, Hon. S. A. Douglas, Hon. George E.  Badger, Hon. Benj. Stanton, Hon. L. *J. Gartrell.  Mr. Mason was called to the chair.  The minutes were read and approved.  The report of the Building Committee for the year 1857 was read  and accepted.  The report of the Executive Committee was presented, together  with the estimates for the year 1858.  Communications relative to the care of the government collections,  the Wynn estate, the publications, investigations^ and other opera-  tions of the Institution, were read.  On motion of Mr. Badger, the Secretary was directed to have the  windows and other parts of the east wing of the building put in good  order.  The following report from Professor Felton was x)resented :  REPORT on the PRESENT OF MISS CONTAXAKI.  The Secretary laid before the Board a volume received from Greece,  and sent as a gift to the Smithsonian Institution, together with the  letter of the Hon. Mr. Spence, late United States minister to Con-  stantinople, to the Secretary of State, and the letter of the Hon. Lewis  Cass, the Secretary of State, to Professor Henry, the Secretary of the  Institution. The volume and the correspondence were referred to  Professor Felton.  The volume was transmitted from Athens, Greece, through Mr.   80 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  Spence. It was designed and executed by a Greek lady of rare liter-  ary accomplisliments, Miss Elizabeth B. Contaxaki, assisted by six  Greek gentlemen, resident in Athens. It contains sketches of the  principal ruins in that city, and views of the most famous historical  places there and in other parts of Greece, correctly drawn and deli-  cately colored, together with the passage, from the classic authors,  in which the objects and places are described or referred to, transla-  tions of the passages, and extracts from English and French writers  on the same subjects. The book is adorned with exquisitely drawn  vignettes, and emblematic devices, and with specimens of the wild  flowers which grow in the places described, carefully preserved,  pressed, and attached to the leaves. The volume is bound in blue  velvet, and tastefully decorated with silver. It is put in an elegantly  and richly carved case, made of olive wood, from the olive groves near  Athens, where stood, in ancient times, the academic groves of Plato's  school. The body of the case is made of the trunk of the tree, and  the ornamental portions, of the root, which is of darker and richer  color. This beautiful gift, t*herefore, combines a great variety of  objects, possessing, from their associations with the loftiest achieve-  ments of Hellenic genius, a deep and singular interest, and forming  a most appropriate memorial of the country from which European  art, education, philosophy, and letters took their rise.  Miss Contaxaki, the tasteful designer of this memorial_, is a native  of the island of Crete. At the time of the outbreak of the Greek  revolution, her father was a landed proprietor there, and, in common  with the great body of the Hellenic race, lost most of his property by  the rapacity and tyranny of the Turks. His family was dispersed,  and his daughter Elizabeth became an inmate in the family of the  Eev. Dr. John H. Hill, the American missionary, who established  himself in Athens, at the close of the war, for the benevolent and  enlightened purpose of aiding the Greeks to reconstruct the shattered  edifice of civilization, by establishing the school, which still continues  to dispense the blessings of education among the children of its first  pupils in that illustrious capital. Kesiding with Dr. Hill for many  years, and educated chiefly under his superintendence and care, Eliza-  beth became known to many American travellers in the East, by  whom she has often been mentioned with a cordial appreciation of her  accomplishments and merits. Their personal relations have naturally  inspired her with a warm interest in the United States, heightened  by the sympathies of the citizens of America in the regeneration of  her country, and the substantial aid furnished by them to Greece in   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 81  the hour of her utmost need. Kecently Miss Contaxaki, after a visit  to Constantinople, where she was received with distinction, has re-  turned to her native island, which is under the government of the  Pacha of Egypt, and, hy her learning and ability, has succeeded in  recovering, through the Moslem tribunal, a portion of her paternal  estate.  The volume now presented to the Smithsonian Institution was sent  to the great Paris Exhibition of 1855, where it excited much admira-  tion, and gained a diploma fur its accomplished author. She has  now transmitted it for permanent deposit among the treasures of the  Smithsonian Institution in the United States.  The Regents of the Institution accept the gift with great pleasure,  not only on account of its rare beauty, its intrinsic value, and the  many interesting associations it suggests with that famous city,  called by Milton \"the eye of Greece, mother of art and arms,\" but  also as an expressive symbol of the hearty good will for the American  republic, cherished by the enlightened spirit of a nation which has so  honorably vindicated its right to the glories of an illustrious descent  by re-establishing the institutions of freedom and learning on the soil  where, in ancient times, they earliest flourished, and with unex-  ampled splendor.  The committee recommends the adoption of the following resolu-  tions by the Board :  Resolved, That the regents of the Smithsonian Institution ac-  cept, with gratitude, the splendid memorial volume presented by Miss  Elizabeth B. Contaxaki, and that they recognize, in the beauty, taste,  and art displayed in its general execution and style of its embellish-  ment, a pleasing indication that the genius which placed the ancient  Greeks at the head of the civilization of the world still survives in  their descendants.  Resolved^ That a copy of the above report, and of these resolutions, be  transmitted, with a letter of acknowledgment from the Smithsonian  Institution, to Miss Contaxaki, the accomplished donor.  On motion, the report was accepted and the resolutions adopted.  The Board then adjourned.  WEDNESDAY, Mat 19, 1858.  The Board met this day in the Vice President's room.

Mason,  6s   82 PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS.  Hon. J. A. Pearce, Hon. S. A. Douglas, Hon. W. H. English, Hon.  Benjamin Stanton, Prof. A. D. Bache, and the Secretary.  The minutes were read and approved.  Mr. Pearce explained the report of the Executive Committee and the  estimates for the year 1858, and, on motion, they were adopted.  The following report was presented from Prof. Felton, of the com-  mittee to whom was referred the communication of Mr. J. M. Stanley:  REPORT ON THE PROPOSITION TO PURCHASE THE INDIAN GALLERY.  N.  The Secretary laid before the Board a letter from Mr. J. M. Stanley,  painter of the gallery of Indian jjortraits, now on deposit with the  Smithsonian Institution, proposing to sell them to the Institution for  the sum of twelve thousand dollars.  The committee appointed to consider and report upon the subject  respectfully represent that, while they are fully sensible of the great  historical and ethnological value of this collection of portraits, and  of their characteristic excellence, they are yet of opinion that it  would be inexpedient to withdraw the sum mentioned from the funds  necessary to carry on the scheme of active operations, which has been  so ably inaugurated and, thus far, so successfully executed. The  income of the Smithsonian fund should not be scattered among differ-  ent and disconnected objects, and the sum necessary for the purchase  of the gallery cannot be spared, without crippling for a time, at least,  the regular operations of the Institution.  Among the Contributions to Knowledge several important works  relating to the aboriginal inhabitants of America have been published  by the Institution and circulated over the civilized world.  Grammars and dictionaries of the Indian languages may be men-  tioned as of special interest, and of great value to the science of com-  parative philology. Their language will probably pass away, and  the races speaking them disappear; but the works to which we allude  will preserve, ibr future investigators of the science of philology,  the characteristic form in which their thoughts were expressed^ and  will have an important bearing, not only on general ethnological  inquiries, but on the j)hilosophy of the human mind. These volumes  have been eagerly sought and studied by the most eminent compara-  tive philologists of Europe, and have, by universal consent^ contri-  buted materially to the increase and diffusion of knowledge among  men in that department of science.  But though your committee are of opinion that the purchase of this   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 83  gallery would interfere with the present plan of operations, and that  it would not so directly tend to the increase and diffusion of know-  ledge, they would earnestly express the opinion that, in a national  point of view, the value of these portraits can hardly be over-  estimated.  They represent forty-three different tribes, and are taken from the  leading personages in them. The artist has studied carefully the  peculiarities of the tribes, the characteristic expressions of the in-  dividuals, their natural attitudes and actions, their several styles of  costume and ornament, and has reproduced, with artistic skill, all these  particulars. To this interesting enterprise he has given ten of the  best years of his life, having traversed, with great labor and incon-  venience, the principal regions inhabited by the subjects of his pencil.  The number of portraits, including that of the artist, enumerated in  the catalogue, is one hundred and fifty-two. The price for which  they are offered is much below their real value, being less than $80  a piece. At the proposed rate the artist will receive no compensation  for his time and labor, and barely enough to defray the cost of material,  transportation, travelling expenses and insurance.  The number of the tribes represented so faithfully in this gallery,  and the prominence of the individuals, render the collection very  complete and satisfactory, as presenting a general view of the charac-  teristic features of the red man. These circumstances make it important  that the gallery should be preserved entire. Its peculiar value con-  sists in its comprehensive character no less than in the fidelity of the  individual details. Centuries hence, when most all of the tribes here  represented shall have disappeared, as the New England tribes, for  example, have nearly disappeared, this gallery will be an object of  .the profoundest interest to the student of man, the historian, the  philosopher, and the statesman.  The relations between the government o* the United States and the  Indian tribes form one of the most delicate and important subjects of  national legislation. The government has not only endeavored to  deal with the red men in a liberal and paternal spirit, but has done  much towards illustrating their character and condition by the pub-  lication of costly works embodying the observations and researches of  investigators who have devoted themselves to Indian studies. It  appears to your committee that to purchase this collection, and to  place it in some secure situation easy of access to visitors at the  capital, would be an act worthy of the enlightened liberality of Con-   84 PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS,  gress. The cost would be insignificant, and the value of the collection  would increase in all future time. No place is so suitable for its  permanent deposit as the city of Washington, and no guardianship so  appropriate as that of the government of the United States.  Your committee recommend to the Board that the subject of the  purchase of Mr. Stanley's Indian gallery be brought respectfully to  the attention of Congress, as a measure eminently deserving a favor-  able consideration in its bearings upon the history of the aboriginal  tribes of America, and as a monument of deep and lasting interest to  the people of the United States.  The report was accepted, and laid on the table for the present.  The Secretary stated that Mr. Putnam having resigned the agency  of the Smithsonian publications in New York,[Messrs. D. Appleton &  Co. had been appointed his successors.  The Secretary announced that since the last meeting of the Board  the death of Dr. Egbert Hare, of Philadelphia, had occurred, who  was one of the principal benefactors of the Institution, and its first  honorary member.  Professor Bache gave an account of the life, character, and scientific  researches of Dr. Hare, and ofi'ered the following resolutions :  Besolvcd, That the Kegents of the Smithsonian Institution have  learned with deep regret the decease of one of the earliest and most  venerated honorary members of the establishment, Kobert Hare, M.D.,  of Philadelphia, late professor of chemistry in the University of  Pennsylvania.  liekolved, That the activity and power of mind of Dr. Hare, shown  through a long and successful career of physical research, the great  fertility of invention, the happy adaptations to matters of practical  life, and the successful grappling with questions of high theory in  physical science, have placed him among the first in his country of  the great contributors to knowledge, clarum et venerahile nom.en.  Befclved, That while we deplore the loss of this great and good  man, who has done so much to keep alive the flame of science in our  country in past days, we especially mourn the generous patron of our  Institution, the sympathizing friend of the youth of some of us, and  the warm-hearted colleague of our manhood.  Jiesolved, That we ofi'er to the bereaved family of Dr. Hare our  sincere condolence in the loss which they have sustained by his death.  The resolutions were adopted.  The report of the Secretary for 1857 was then accepted.   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 85  Professor Felton, in behalf of the special committee to whom the  following communication of Professor Henry of March 16, 1857,  together with accompanying documents, &c., were referred, presentej^  a report.  COM.MUNICATION FROM PROF. HENRY, SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN  INSTITUTION, RELATIVE TO A PUBLICATION BY PROF. MORSE.  Gentlemen : In the discharge of the important and responsible  duties which devolve upon me as Secretary ot the Smithsonian Insti-  tution, I have found myself exposed, like other men in public positions,  to unprovoked attack and injurious misrepresentation. Many instances  of this, it may be remembered, occurred about two years ago, during  the discussions relative to the organic policy of the Institution ; but,  though very unjust, they were suffered to pass unnoticed, and gene-  rally made, I presume, no lasting impression on the public mind.  During the same controversy, however, there was one attack made  upon me of such a nature, so elaborately prepared and widely circu-  lated, by my opponents, that, though I have not yet publicly noticed  H, 1 have from the first thought it my duty not to allow it to go un-  answered. I allu<le to an article in a periodical entitled \" Shatfner's  Telegraph Companion,\" from the pen of Prof. S. F. B. Morse, the  celebrated inventor of the American electro-magnetic telegraph. In  this, not my scientific reputation merely, but my moral character was  pointedly assailed ; indeed, nothing less was attempted than to prove  that in the testimony which I had given in a case where I was at  most but a reluctant witness, I had consciously and wilfully deviated  from the truth, and this, too, from unworthy and dishonorable  motives.  Such a charge, coming from such a quarter, appeared to me then, as  it appears now, of too grave a character and too serious a consequence  to be withheld from the notice of the Board of Regents. I, therefore,  presented the matter unofficially to the Chancellor of the Institution,  Chief Justice Taney, and was advised by him to allow the matter to  rest until the then existing excitement with respect to the organiza-  tion of the Institution should subside, and that in the meantime the  materials for a refutation of the charge might be collected and pre-  pared, to be brought forw^ard at the proper time_, if I should think it  necessary.  The article of Mr. Morse was published in 1855, but at the session  of the Board in 1856 I was not prepared to present the case properly   86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS.  to your consideration, and I now (1857) embrace the first opportunity  of bringing the subject officially to your notice, and asking from you  an investigation into the justice of the charges alleged against me.  And this I do most earnestly, with the desire that when we shall all  have passed from this stage of being, no imputation of having at-  tempted to evadein silence so grave a charge shall rest on me, nor on you,  of having continued to devolve upon me duties of the highest respon-  sibility, after that was known to some of you individually, which, if  true, should render me entirely unworthy of your confidence. Duty  to the Board of Regents, as well as regard to my own memory, to my  family, and to the truth of history, demands that I should lay thi^  matter before you, and place in your hands the documents necessary  to establish the veracity of my testimony, so falsely impeached, and  the integrity of my motives, so wantonly assailed.  My life, as is known to you, has been principally devoted to science,  and my investigations in different branches of physics have given me  some reputation in the line of original discovery. I have sought,  however, no patent for inventions, and solicited no remuneration for  my labors, but have freely given their results to the world, expecting  only, in return, to enjoy the consciousness of having added^ by my in-  yCstigations, to the sum of human knowledge^ and to receive the  credit to which they might justly entitle me.  I commenced my scientific career about the year 1828, with a series  of experiments in electricity, which were continued at intervals up to  the period of my being honored by election to the office of Secretary  of this Institution. The object of my researches was the advancement  of science, without any special or immediate reference to its applica-  tion to the wants of life or useful purposes in the arts. It is true, nev-  ertheless, that some of my earlier investigations had an important  bearing on the electro-magnetic telegraph, and brought the science to  that point of development at which it was immediately applicable to  Mr. Morse's particular invention.  In 1831 I published a brief account of these researches, in which I  drew attention to the fact of their applicability to the telegraph ; and  in 1832, and subsequently, exhibited experiments illustrative of the  application of the electro-magnet to the transmission of power to a  distance, for producing telegraphic and other effects. The results I  had published were communicated to Mr. Morse, by his scientific  assistant. Dr. Gale, as will be shown on the evidence of the latter ;  and the facts which I had discovered were promptly applied in render-  ing effective the operation of his machine.   PEOCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 87  In the latter part of 1837 I became personally acquainted with Mr.  Morse, and at that time, and afterwards, freely gave him information  in regard to the scientific principles which had been the subject of my  investigations. After his return from Europe, in 1839, our intercourse  was renewed, and continued uninterrupted till 1845. In that year,  Mr. Vail, a partner and assistant of Mr. Morse, published a work pur-  porting to be a history of the Telegraph, in which I conceived manifest  injustice was done me. I complained of this to a mutual friend, and  subsequently received an assurance from Mr. Morse that if another  edition were published, all just ground of complaint should be removed.  A new emission of the work, however, shortly afterwards appeared,  without change in this respect, or further reference to my labors. Still  I made no public complaint, and set up no claims on account of the  telegraph. I was content that my published researches should remain  as material for the history of science, and be pronounced upon, accord-  ing to their true value, by the scientific world.  After this, a series of controversies and lawsuits having arisen be-  tween rival claimants for telegraphic patents, I was repeatedly ap-  pealed to, to act as expert and witness in such cases. This I uniformly  declined to do, not wishing to be in any manner involved in these lit-  igations, but was finally compelled, under legal process, to return  to Boston from Maine, whither I had gone on a visit, and to give evi-  dence on the subject. My testimony was given with the statement that  I was not a willing witness, and that I labored under the disadvantage  of not having access to my notes and papers, which were in Washing-  ton. That testimony, however, I now reaffirm to be true in every  essential particular. It was unimpeached before the court, and exer-  cised an influence on the final decision of the question at issue.  I was called upon on that occasion to state, not only what I had pub-  lished, bat what I had done, and what I had shown to others in regard  to the telegraph. It was my wish, in every statement, to render Mr.  Morse full and scrupulous justice. While I was constrained, there-  fore, to state that he had made no discoveries in science, I distinctly  declared that he was entitled to the merit of .combining and applying  the discoveries of others, in the invention of the best practical form of  the magnetic telegraph. My testimony tended to establish the fact  that, though not entitled to the exclusive use of the electro-magnet for  telegraphic purposes, he was entitled to his particular machine, register,  alphabet, &c. As this, however, did not meet the full requirements of  Mr. Morse's comprehensive claim, I could not but be aware that, while   88 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  aimiug to depose nothing but truth and the whole truth, and while so  doing being obliged to speak of my own discoveries, and to allude to the  omissions in Mr. Vail's book, I might expose myself to the possible,  and, as it has proved, the actual, danger of having my motives mis-  construed and my testimony misrepresented. But I can truly aver, in  accordance w ith the statement of the counsel, Mr. Chase, (now governor  of Ohio,) that I had no desire to arrogate to myself undue merit, or to  detract from the just claims of Mr. Morse.  I have the honor to be your obedient servant,  JOSEPH HENEY.  To THE Board of Regents.  The Chancellor, Chief Justice Taney, corroborated Prof. Henry's  statement as to his advising a delay in noticing the publication re-  ferred to until the public mind should be more settled in regard to  the policy of the Institution, and the discussions which had arisen in  Congress in reference to it should be ended.  He stated that it would be seen by the report of the decision of the  Supreme Court, in the case in which Professor Henry was a witness,  that, in the opinion of the court. Professor Morse had produced no  testimony that could invalidate the testimony of Professor Henry, or  impair in any degree its weight, and gave full credit to it in the  udgment it pronounced.   REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS ON THE  COMMUNICATION OF PROFESSOR HENRY.  Professor Henry laid before the Board of Regents of the Smithso-  nian Institution a communication relative to an article in Shaffner's  Telegraph Companion, bearing the signature of Samuel F. B. Morse,  the inventor of the American electro-magnetic telegraph. In this  article serious charges are brought against Professor Henry, bearing  upon his scientific reputation and his moral character. The whole  matter having been referred to a committee of the Board, with in-  structions to report on the same, the committee have attended to the  duty assigned to them, and now submit the following brief report, with  resolutions accompanying it.  The committee have carefully examined the documents relating to  the subject, and es2)eciaUy the article to which the communication of  Professor Henry refers. This article occupies over ninety pages, filling  an entire number of Shaffner's Journal, and purports to be \"a defence   PROCEEDINGS OF 7 HE EEGENT3. 89  against the injurious deductions drawn from the deposition of Professor  Joseph Henry, (in the several telegraph suits,) with a critical review  of said deposition, and an examination of Professor Henry's alleged  discoveries bearing upon the electro-magnetic telegraph.\"  The first thing which strikes the reader of this article is, that its  title is a misnomer. It is simply an assault upon Professor Henry ;  an attempt to disparage his character ; to deprive him of his honors  as a scientific discoverer ; to impeach his credibility as a witness and  his integrity as a man. It is a disingenuous piece of sophistical  argument, such as an unscrupulous advocate might employ to pervert  the truth, misrepresent the fiicts, and misinterpret the language in  which the facts belonging to the other side of the case are stated.  Mr. Morse charges that the deposition of Professor Henry *' con-  tains imputations against his (Morse's) personal character,\" which  it does not, and assumes it as a duty ''to expose the utter non-  reliability of Professor Henry's testimony;\" that testimony being  supported by the most competent authorities, and by the history of  scientific discovery. He asserts that he \"is not indebted to him  (Professor Henry) for any discovery in science bearing on the tele-  graph,\" he having himself acknowledged such indebtedness in the  most unequivocal manner, and the fact being independently substan-  tiated by the testimony of Sears C. Walker, and the statement of  Mr. Morse's own associate, Dr. Gale. Mr. Morse further maintains,  that all discoveries bearing upon the telegraph were made, not by  Professor Henry, but by others, and prior to any experiments of Pro-  fessor Henry in the science of electro-magnetism ; contradicting in  this proposition the facts in the history of scientific discovery perfectly  established and recognized throughout the scientific world.  The essence of the charges against Prof. Henry is, that he gave  false testimony in his deposition in the telegraph cases, and that he  has claimed the credit of discoveries in the sciences bearing upon the  electro-magnetic telegraph which were made by previous investigators ;  in other words, that he has falsely claimed what does not belong to  him, but does belong to others.  Professor Henry, as a private man, might safely have allowed such  charges to pass in silence. But standing in the important position  which he occupies, as the chief executive officer of the Smithsonian In-  stitution ; and regarding the charges as undoubtedly containing an  impeachment of his moral character, as well as of his scientific repu-  tation ; and justly sensitive, not only for his own honor, but for the  honor of the Institution, he has a right to ask this Board to consider   90 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  the subject, and to make their conclusions a matter of record, which  may be appealed to hereafter should any question arise with regard to  his conduct in the premises.  Your committee do not conceive it to be necessary to follow Mr.  Morse through all the details of his elaborate attack. Fortunately, a  plain statement of a few leading facts will be sufficient to place  the essential points of the case in a clear light.  The deposition already referred to was reluctantly given, and under  the compulsion of legal process, by Prof Henry, before the Hon. Geo.  S. Hillard, United States commissioner, on the 7th of September, 1849.  The following is the statement of the Hon. S. P. Chase, (now gov-  ernor of Ohio,) one of the counsel in the telegraph cases, in a letter  to Professor Henry, dated Columbus, Ohio, November 26, 1856 :  In the year 1849, 1 was professionally employed in the defence of  certain gentlemen engaged in the business of telegraphing between  Louisville and New Orleans, against whom a bill of complaint had  been filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of  Kentucky. The object of the bill was to restrain the defendants, my  clients, from the use in telegraphing of a certain instrument called  the Columbian Telegraph, on the ground that it was an infringe-  ment upon the rights of the complainants under the patents granted  to Professor Morse. It therefore became my duty, in the preparation  of their defence, to ascertain the precise nature and extent of their  rights. With this view I called upon you, in August or September  of that year, for your deposition. It was taken before George S.  Hillard, esq., a United States commissioner for the district of Massa-  chusetts, in Boston. I remember very well that you were unwilling to  be involved in the controversy, even as a witness, and that you only  submitted to be examined in compliance with the requirements of law.  Not one of your statements was volunteered. They were all called out  by questions propounded either verbally or in writing. I was not suf-  ficiently familiar at the time with the precise merits of the case to  know what would or would not be important, and therefore insisted on  a full statement, not merely of the general history of electro-magnet-  ism as applied to telegraphing, but of all your own discoveries in  that science having relation to the same art, and of all that had passed  between yourself and Professor Morse connected with these discoveries  or with the telegraph. You could not have refused to respond to the  questions propounded, without subjecting yourself to judicial animad-  version and constraint. Nothing in what you testified, or your manner  of testifying, suggested to me the idea that you were animated by any  desire to arrogate undue merit to yourself, or to detract from the just  claims of Prolessor Morse.  S. P. CHASE.  Previous to this deposition, Mr. Morse, as appears from his own  letters and statements, entertained for Prof, Henry the warmest feel-  ings of personal regard, and the highest esteem for his character as a   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 91  scientific man. In a letter, dated April 24, 1839, he thanks Prof.  Henry for a copy of his \" valuable contributions,\" and says, \" I per-  ceive many things (in the contributions) of great interest to me in my  telegraphic enterprise.\" Again, in the same letter, speaking of an  intended visit to the Professor at Princeton, he says : \"I should come  as a learner, and could bring no ' contributions' to your stock of ex-  periments of any value.\" And still further : \" I think that you have  pursued an original course of experiments, and discovered facts more  immediately bearing upon my invention than any that have been  published abroad.\"  It appears, from Mr. l^Iorse's own statement, that he had at least  two interviews with Prof. Henry â€” one in May, 1839, when he passed  the afternoon and night with him, at Princeton ; and another in Feb-  ruary, 1844 â€” both of them for the purpose of conferring with him on  subjects relating to the telegraph, and evidently with the conviction,  on Mr. Morse's part, that Prof. Henry's investigations were of great  importance to the success of the telegraph.  As late as 1846, after Mr. Morse had learned that some dissatisfac-  tion existed in Prof. Henry's mind in regard to the manner in which  his researches in electricity had been passed over by Mr. Vail, an  assistant of Mr. Morse, and the author of a history of the American  magnetic telegraph, Mr. Morse, in an interview with Prof. Henry, at  Washington, said, according to his own account, \" Well, Prof. Henry,  I will take the earliest opportunity that is afforded me in anything I  may publish to have justice don^ to your labors ; for I do not think  that justice has been done you, either in Europe or this country.\"  Again^ in 1848, when Prof. Walker, of the Coast Survey, made  his report on the theory of Morse's electro-magnetic telegraph, in  which the expression occurred, \"the helix of a soft iron magnet,  prepared after the manner first pointed out by Prof. Henry,\" Mr.  Morse, to whom the report way submitted, said: \"I have now the  long wished for opportunity to do justice publicly to Henry's dis-  covery bearing on the telegraph.\" And in a note prepared by him,  and intended to be printed with Prof. Walker's report, he says :  \" The allusion you make to the helix of a soft iron magnet, prepared  after the manner first pointed out by Prof. Henry, gives me an o])-  portunity, of which I gladly avail myself, to say that I think that  justice has not yet been done to Prof. Henry, either in Europe or in  this country, for the discovery of a scientific fact, which, in its bear-  ing on telegraphs, whether of the magnetic needle or electro-magnet  order, is of the greatest importance.\"   92 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  He then proceeds to give a historical synopsis^ showing that,  although suggestions had been made and plans devised by Soemmering,  in 1811, and by Ampere, in 1820, yet that the experiments of Barlow,  in 1824, had led that investigator to pronounce \" the idea of an elec-  tric telegraph to be chimerical\" â€” an opinion that was, for the time,  acquiesced in by scientific men. He shows that, in the interval be-  tween 1824 and 1829, no further suggestions were made on the sub-  ject of electric telegraphs. But he proceeds â€” '' In 1830, Prof. Henry,  assisted by Dr. Ten Eyck, while engaged in experiments on the ap-  plication of the principle of the galvanic multiplier to the development  of great magnetic power in soft iron, made the important discovery  that a battery of intensity overcame that resistance in a long wire  which Barlow had announced as an insuperable bar to the construc-  tion of electric telegraphs. Thus was opened the way for fresh efforts  in devising a practicable electric telegraph ; and Baron Schilling, in  1832, and Professors Gauss and Weber, in 1833, had ample oppor-  tunity to learn of Henry's discovery, and avail themselves of it, before  they constructed their needle telegraphs.\" And, while claiming for  himself that he was'\" the first to propose the use of the electro-magnet  for telegraphic purposes, and the first to construct a telegraph on the  basis of the electro-magnet,\" yet he adds, \" ^o Professor Henry is  unquestionably due the honor of the discovery of a principle which proves  the practicability of exciting magnetism through a long coil, or at a dis-  tance, either to deflect a needle or to magnetize soft iron.\"  What Mr. Morse here describes as \"a principle,\" the discovery of  which is unquestionably due to Professor Henry, is the law which  first made it possible to work the telegraphic machine invented by  Mr. Morse, and for the knowledge of which Mr. Morse was indebted to  Professor Henry, as is positively asserted by his associate, Dr. GtALE.  This gentleman, in a letter, dated Washington, April 7, 1856, makes  the following conclusive statement :  Washington, D. C, April 7, 1856.  Sir : In reply to your note of the 3d instant, respecting the Morse  telegraph, asking me to state definitely the condition of the invention  when I first saw the apparatus in the winter of 1836, I answer: This  apparatus was Morse's original instrument, usually known as the type  a})paratus, in which the types, set up in a composing stick, were run  through a circuit breaker, and in which the battery was the cylinder  battery, with a single pair of plates. This arrangement also had another  peculiarity, namely, it was the electro-magnet used by Moll, and shown  in drawings of the older works on that subject, having only a few  turns of wire in the coil which surrounded the poles or arms of the  magnet. The sparseness of the wires in the magnet coils and the use   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 93  of the single cup battery were to me, on tlie first look at the instru-  ment, obvious marks of defect, and I accordingly suggested to the  Professor, without giving my reasons for so doing, that a battery of  many pairs should be substituted ior that of a single pair, and that  the coil on each arm of the masfnet should be increased to many hun-  dred turns each ; which experiment, if I remember aright, was made  on the same day with a battery and wire on hand, furnished I believe  by myself, and it was found that while the original arrangement  woukl only send the electric current through a few feec of wire, say  15 to 40, the modified arrangement would send it through as many  hundred. Although I gave no reasons at the time to Professor Morse  for the suggestions I had proposed in modifying the arrangement of  the machine, I did so afterwards, and referred in my explanations to  the paper of Professor Henry, in the 19th volume of the American  Journal of Science, ])age 400 and onward. It was to these sugges-  tions of mine that Professor Morse alludes in his testimony before  the circuit court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, in the trial  of B. B. French and others vs. Rogers and others. â€” See piinted copy  of Complainant's Evidence, page 1G8, beginning with the words  \"Early in 1836 I procured 40 feet of wire,\" &c., and page 169, where  Professor Morse alludes to myself and compensation for services ren-  dered to him, &G.  At the time I gave the suggestions above named, Professor Morse  was not familiar with the then existing state of the science ot electro-  magnetism. Had he been so, or had he read and appreciated the  paper of Henry, tlie suggestions made by me would naturally have  occurred to his mind as they did to my own. But the principal part  of Morse's great invention lay in the mechanical ada})tation of a power  to produce motion, and to increase or relax at will. It was only  necessary for him to know that such a power existed for him to adapt  mechanism to direct and control it.  My suggestions were made to Professor Morse from inferences  drawn by reading Professor Henry's paper above alluded to. Profes-  sor Morse professed great surprise at the contents of the paper when  I showed it to him, but especially at the remarks on Dr. Barlow's re-  sults respecting telegraphing, which were new to him, and he stated  at the time that he was not aware that any one had even conceived  the idea of using the magnet for such purposes.  With sentiments of esteem, I remain yours truly,  L. D. GALE.  Prof. Jos. Henry,  Sec/etary of the Smithsonian Institution.  It further appears, that principally for the information thus commu-  nicated Mr. Morse assigned to Dr. Gale an interest in the telegraph,  which he afterwards purchased back for $15,000, as appears from the  following letter of Dr. Gale :  Patent Office, August 5, 1857.  Dear Sir : In reply to yours of this date, respecting the interest I  once possessed in Morse's telegraph patent, secured to me by the said  Morse, as alluded to by him in his statement to the Commissioner of   94 PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS.  Patents, I would simply state that the part I owned when I entered  the service of the government in this office was orginally given me hy  the said Morse for services rendered him in making his invention  practically effective in sending currents through long distances, &c.,  and that the said interest was retransferred to the said Morse for the  sum of fifteen thousand dollars.  Kespectfully,  L. D. GALE.  Professor Henry,  Secretary Smithsonian Institution.  It thus appears, both from Mr. Morse's own admission down to  1848^ and from the testimony of others most familiar with the facts,  that Professor Henry discovered the la,w, or \" principle,\" as Mr. Morse  designates it, which was necessary to make the practical working of  the electro-magnetic telegraph at considerable distances possible; that  Mr. Morse was first informed of this discovery by Dr. Gale ; that he  availed himself of it at once, and that it never occurred to Mr. Morse  to deny this fact until after 1848. He had steadily and fully acknow-  ledged the merits and genius of Mr. Henry, as the discoverer of facts  and laws in science of the highest importance to the success of his  long-cherished invention of a magnetic telegraph, Mr. Henry was  the discoverer of a principle, Mr. Morse was the inventor of a machine,  the object of which was to record characters at a distance, to convey  intelligence, in other words, to carry into execution the idea of an  electric telegraph. But there were obstacles in tlie way which he  could not overcome until he learned the discoveries of Professor Henry,  and applied them to his machine. These facts are undeniable. They  constitute a part of the history of science and invention. They were  true in 1848, they were equally true in 1855, when Professor Morse's  article was published. We give a passage here from the deposition  of Sears C. Walker, in the case of French vs. Ptogers, Kespondent's  Evidence, page 199, bearing upon this whole subject :  \"In consequence of some statements made by me in my official  reports relative to the invention of the receiving magnet, a question  arose between Mr. Morse and myself as to the origin of this invention.  It was amicably discussed by Mr. Morse, Professor Henry, Dr. Gale,  and myself, with Professor Henry's article, alluded to in answer to  the second question before us. The result of the interview was con-  clusive to my mind that Professor Henry was the sole discoverer of  the law on which the intensity magnet depends for its power of send-  ing the galvanic current through a long circuit. I was also led to  conclude that Mr. Morse, in the course of his own researches and ex-  periments before he had read Professor Henry's article, before alluded  to, had encountered the same difficulty Mr. Barlow and those who  preceded him had encountered, that is, the impossibility of forcing   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 95  the galvanic current throiigli a long telegraph line. His own per-  sonal researches had not overcome this obstacle. They were made in  the laboratory of the New York University. I also learned at the  same time, by the conversations above stated, that he only overcame  this obstacle by constructing a magnet on tlie principle invented by Pro-  fessor Henry, and described in his article in 8illiman's Journal. His  attention was directed to it by Dr. Gale.\"  What changed Mr. Morse's opinion of Professor Henry, not only  as a scientific investigator, but as a man of integrity, after the admis-  sions of his indebtedness to his researches, and the oft repeated ex-  pressions of warm personal regard ? It appears that Mr. Morse was  involved in a number of lawsuits, growing out of contested claims to  the right of using electricity for telegraphic purposes. The circum-  stances under which Professor Henry, as a well known investigator in  this department of physics, was summoned by one of the parties to  testify have already been stated. The testimony of Mr. Henry_, while  supporting the claims of Mr. Morse as the inventor of an admirable  invention, denied to him the additional merit of being a discoverer of  new facts or laws of nature, and to this extent, perhaps, was consid-  ered unfavorable to some part of the claim of Mr. Morse to an exclu-  sive right to employ the electro-magnet for telegraphic purposes.  Professor Henry's deposition consists of a series of answers to verbal,  as well as written, interrogatories propounded to him, which were not  limited to his published writings, or the subject of electricity, but ex-  tended to investigations and discoveries in general having a bearing  upon the electric telegraph. He gave his testimony at a distance  from his notes and manuscripts, and it would not have been surprising  if inaccuracies had occurred in some parts of his statement ; but all  the material points in it are sustained by independent testimony, and  that portion which relates directly to Mr. Morse agrees entirely with  the statement of his own assistant. Dr. Gale. Had his deposition  been objectionable, it ought to have been impeached before the Court ;  but this was not attempted ; and the following tribute to Professor  Henry by the judge, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court  of the United States, indicates the impression made upon the Court  itself by all the testimony in the case : \" It is due to him to say that  no one has contributed more to enlarge the knowledge of electro-  magnetism, and to lay the foundations of the great invention of which  we are speaking, than the Professor himself.\"  Professor Henry's answers to the first and second interrogatories  present a condensed history of the progress of the science of electro-  magnetism, as connected with telegraphic communication, embracing   96 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  an account of the discoveries of Oersted, Arago, Davy, Ampere; of  the investigations hy Barlow and Sturgeon ; of his own researches,  commenced in 1828, and continued in 1829, 1830, and subsequently.  The details of his experiments and their results, though brief, are  very precise. There is abundant evidence to show that Professor  Henry's experiments and illustrations at Albany, and subsequently  at Princeton, proved, and were declared at the time by him to prove,  that the electric telegraph was now practicable ; that the electro-  magnet might be used to produce mechanical effects at a distance  adequate to making signals of various kinds, such as ringing bells,  which he practically illustrated. In proof of this, we quote a letter  to Professor Henry, from Professor James Hall, of Albany, late  president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science:  January 19, 1856.  Dear Sir: While a student of the Rensselaer School, in Troy,  New York, in August, 1832, I visited Albany with a friend, having  a letter of introduction to you from Professor Eaton. Our principal  object was to see your electro-magnetic apparatus, of which we had  heard much, and at the same time the library and collections of the  Albany Institute.  You showed us your laboratory in a lower story or basement of  the buikling, and in a larger room in an upper story some electric  and galvanic apparatus, with various philosophical instruments. In  this room, and extending around the same, was a circuit of wire  stretched along the wall, and at one termination of this, in the recesi.'.  of a window, a bell was fixed, while the other extremity was con-  nected with a galvanic apj)aratus.  You showed us the manner in which the bell could be made to ring  by a current of electricity, transmitted through this wire, and you  remarked that this method might be adopted for giving signals, by  the ringing of a bell at the distance of many miles from the point of  its connexion with the galvanic apparatus.  All the circumstances attending this visit to Albany are fresh in ray  recollection, and during the past years, while so much has been said  respecting the invention of electric telegraphs, I have olten had occa-  sion to mention the exhibition of your electric telegraph in the Albany  Academy, in 1832.  If at any time or under any circumstances this statement can be of  service to you in substantiating your claim to such a discovery at the  period named, you are at liberty to use it in any manner you jdease,  and I shall be ready at all times to repeat and sustain what I have  here stated, with many other attendant circumstances, should they  prove of any importance.  I remain very sincerely and respectfully yours,  JAMES HALL.  Professor Joseph Henry.   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 97  In his deposition, Prof. Henry's statements are witliin what he  might fairly have claimed. But he is a man of science, looking for  no other reward than the consciousness of having done something for  its promotion, and the reputation which the successful prosecution of  scientific investigations and discoveries may justly be expected to give.  In his public lectures and published writings he has often pointed out  incidentally the possibility of applying the facts and laws of nature  discovered by him to practical purposes ; he has freely communicated  information to those who have sought it from him, among whom has  been Mr. Morse himself, as appears by his own acknowledgments.  But he has never applied his scientific discoveries to practical ends for  his own pecuniary benefit. It was natural, therefore, that he should  feel a repugnance to taking any part in the litigation between rival  inventors, and it was inevitable that, when forced to give his testi-  mony, he should distinctly point out what was so clear in his own  mind and is so fundamental a fact in the history of human progress,  the distinctive functions of the discoverer and the inventor who ap-  plies discoveries to practical purposes in the business of life.  Mr. Henry has always done full justice to the invention of Mr.  Morse. While he could not sanction the claim of Mr. Morse to the  exclusive use of the electro-magnet, he has given him full credit for  the mechanical contrivances adapted to the application of his invention.  In proof of this we refer to his deposition, and present also the following  statement of Hon. Charles Mason, Commissioner of Patents, taken  from a letter addressed by him to Prof. Henry, dated March 31, 1856:  U. S. Patent Office, 3Iarch 31, 1856.  Sir: Agreeably to your request I now make the following state-  ment:  Some two years since, when an application was made for an exten-  sion of Prof. Morse's patent, I was for some time in doubt as to the pro-  priety of making that extension. Under these circumstances I con-  sulted with several persons, and among others with yourself, with a  view particularly to ascertain the amount of invention fairly due to  Prof. Morse.  The result of my inquiries was such as to induce me to grant the  extension. I will further say that this was in accordance with your  express recommendation, and that I was probably more influenced by  this recommendation, and the information I obtained from you, than  by any other circumstance, in coming to that conclusion.  I am, sir, yours very respectfully,  CHAKLES MASON.  Prof. J. Henry.  To sum up the results of the preceding investigation in a few words  7s   98 , PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS.  We have shown that Mr. Morse himself has acknowledged the value  of the discoveries of Prof. Henry to his electric telegraph; that his  associate and scientific assistant, Dr. Grale, has distinctly affirmed that  these discoveries were applied to his telegraph, and that previous to  such application it was impossible for Mr. Morse to operate his instru-  ment at a distance; that Prof. Henry's experiments were witnessed  by Prof, Hall and others in 1832, and that these experiments showed  the possibility of transmitting to a distance a force capable of pro-  ducing mechanical effects adequate to making telegraphic signals ;  that Mr. Henry's deposition of 1849, which evidently furnished the  motive for Mr. Morse's attack upon him, is strictly correct in all the  historical details, and that, so far as it relates to Mr. Henry's own  claim as a discoverer, is within what he might have claimed with en-  tire justice; that he gave the deposition reluctantly, and in no spirit  of hostility to Mr. Morse ; that on that and other occasions he fully  admitted the merit of Mr. Morse as an inventor ; and that Mr. Morse's  patent was extended through the influence of the favorable opinion  expressed by Professor Henry.  Your committee come unhesitatingly to the conclusion that Mr.  Morse has failed to substantiate any one ot the charges he has made  against Prof. Plenry, although the burden of proof lay upon him ; and  that all the evidence, including the unbiased admissions of Mr. Morse  himself, is on the other side. Mr. Morse's charges not only remain  unproved but they are positively disproved.  Your committee recommend the adoption of the following resolu-  tions :  Resolved, That Professor Morse has not succeeded in refuting the  statements of Professor Henry in the deposition given by the latter in  1849; that he has not proved any one of the accusations against Prof.  Henry made in the article in Shaffner's Telegraph Companion in 1855,  and that he has not disproved any one of his own admissions in re-  gard to Prof. Henry's discoveries in electro-magnetism, and their im-  portance to his own invention of the electro-magnetic telegraph.  Resolved, That there is nothing in Professor Morse's article that di-  minishes, in the least, the confidence of this Board in the integrity of  Prof. Henry, or in the value of those great discoveries which have  placed his name among those of the most distinguished cultivators of  science, and have done much to exalt the scientific reputation of the  country.  Resolved, That this report, with the resolutions, be recorded in the  Proceedings of the Board of Kegents of the Institution.   PROCEEDINGS OF THE KE GENTS. 99  The report was accepted and the resolutions were unanimously  adopted. The Board then adjourned sine die.   APPENDIX TO THE REPOFvT OF THE COMMITTEE.   STATEMENT OF PROFESSOK HENRY IN RELATION TO THE HISTORY OF THE  ELECTRO MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH.  In the beginning of ray deposition I was requested to give a sketch  of the history of electro-magnetism having a bearing on the telegraph,  and the account I then gave from memory I have since critically  examined and find it fully corroborated by reference to the original  authorities. My sketch, which was the substance of what I had been  in the habit of giving in my lectures, was necessarily very concise, and  almost exclusively confined to one class of facts, namely, those having  a direct bearing on Mr. Morse's invention, and my paper in Silliman's  Journal was likewise very brief and intended merely for scientific  men. In order, therefore, to set forth more clearly in what my own  improvements consisted it may be proper to give a few additional  particulars respecting some points in the progress of discovery, illus-  trated by wood cuts.  There are several forms of the electrical telegraph : first, that in  which frictional electricity has been proposed to j)roduce sparks and  â–  motion of pith balls at a distance.  Second, that in which galvanism has been employed to produce  ; signals by means of bubbles of gas from the decomposition of water.  Third, that in which electro-magnetism is the motive power to  produce motion at a distance; and again, of the latter there are two  i kinds of telegraph, those in which the intelligence is indicated by the  motion of a magnetic needle, and those in which sounds and per-  manent signs are made by the attraction of an electro-magnet. The'  latter is the class to which Mr. Morse's invention belongs. The fol-  lowing is a brief exposition of the several steps which led to this- form  of the telegraph.  The first essential fact, as I stated in my testimony, which ren-  dered the electro-magnetic telegraph possible was discovered by  Oersted, in the winter of 1819-'20. It is illustrated by figure 1, in:  which the magnetic ^'s- 1.  needle is deflected by ^  the action of a cur-  rent of galvanism  transmitted through  the wire A B. (See Annals of Philosophy, vol. 16, page 273.)   A *â–     100 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS,   1    The second fact of importance, discovered in 1820, by Arago and  ^'^â€¢^* Davy, is illustrated in  figure 2. It consists  in this, that while a  current of galvanism is  passing through a cop-  per wire A B, it is  magnetic, it attracts iron filings and not those of copper or brass, and  is capable of developing magnetism in soft iron. (See Annales de  Chimie, vol. 15, page 94.)  The next important discovery, also made in IKIO, by Ampere, was  that two wires through which galvanic currents are passing in the  same direction attract, and in opposite direction repel, each other.  On this fact Ampere founded his celebrated theory, that magnetism  onsists merely in the attraction of electrical currents revolving at  right angles to the line joining the two poles of the magnet. The  magnetisation of a bar of steel or iron, according to this theory, con-  ..â– sists in establishing within the metal by induction a series of electrical  .. Â©urrents, all revolving in the same direction at right angles to the  axis or length of the bar. (See Annales de Chimie, vol. 15, page 69.)  It was this theory which led Arago, as he states, to adopt the method  , of magnetizing sewing needles and pieces of steel wire, shown in  Fig. 3. figure 3. This method  tricity through a helix  surrounding the needle or wire to be magnetized. For the  purpose of insulation the needle was inclosed in a glass tube, and the  several turns of the helix were at a distance from each other to insure  the passage of electricity, through the whole length of the wire, or, in  other words, to prevent it from seeking a shorter passage by cutting  across from one spire to another. The helix employed by Arago  obviously approximates the arrangement required by the theory of  Ampere, in order to develop by induction the magnetism of the iron.  By an attentive perusal of the original account of the experiments of  Arago, given in the Annales de Chimie et Physique, vol. XV, 1820,  page 93, it will be seen that, properly speaking, he made no electro-  magnet, as has been asserted by Morse and others ; his experiments  wer*e confined to the magnetism of iron filings, to sewing needles and  pieces of steel wire of the diameter of a millimetre, or of about the  thickness of a small knitting needle. (See Annales de Chimie, vol.  15, page 95.)    PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS. 101  Mr. Sturgeon, in 1825, made an important step in advance of the  experiments of Arago, and produced what is properly known as the  electro-magnet. He bent a piece of iron loire into the form of a horse-  shoe, covered it with varnish to insulate it, and surrounded it with a  helix, of which the spires were at a distance. When a current of  galvanism was passed through the helix from a small battery of a  single cup the iron wire became magnetic, and continued so during  the passage of the current. When the current was interrupted the  magnetism disappeared^ and thus was produced the first temporary  soft iron magnet.  The electro-magnet of Sturgeon is shown pig.4,  in figure 4, which is an exact copy from the  drawing in the Transactions of the Society  for the Encouragement of Arts, &c., vol.  XLIII. By comparing figures 3 and 4  it will be seen that the helix employed  by Sturgeon was of the same kind as that  used by Arago ; instead, however, of b  straight steel wire inclosed in a tube of  glass, the former employed a bent wire of soft iron. The difference  in the arrangement at first sight might appear to be small, but the  difference in the results produced was important, since the temporary  magnetism developed in the arrangement of Sturgeon was sufficient  to support a weight of several pounds, and an instrument was thus  produced of value in future research.  The next improvement was made by myself. After reading an  account of the galvanometer of Schweigger, the idea occurred to me that  a much nearer approximation to the requirements of the theory of  Ampere could be attained by insulating the conducting wire itself,  instead of the rod to be magnetized, and by covering the whole sur-  face of the iron with a series of coils in close contact. This was  effected by insulating a long wire with silk thread, and winding this  around the rod of iron in close coils from one end to the other. The  same principle was extended by employing a still Fig. 5.  longer insulated wire, and winding several strata  of this over the first, care being taken to insure  the insulation between each stratum by a cover--  ing of silk ribbon. By this arrangement the rod  was surrounded by a compound helix formed of a  long wire of many coils, instead of a single helix  of a few coils, (figure 5.)    102 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  In the arrangement of Arago and Sturgeon the several turns of  wire were not precisely at right angles to the axis of the rod, as they  should he^ to produce the effect required by the theory, but slightly  oblique, and therefore each tended to develop a separate magnetism  not coincident with the axis of the bar. But in winding the wire  over itself the obliquity of the several turns compensated each  other, and the resultant action was at right angles to the bar. The  arrangement then introduced by myself was superior to those of  Arago and Sturgeon, first in the greater multiplicity of turns of wire,  and second in the better application of these turns to the development  of magnetism. The power of the instrument, with the same amount  of galvanic force, was by this arrangement several times increased.  The maximum effect, however, with this arrangement and a single  battery was not yet obtained. After a certain length of wire had  been coiled upon the iron the power diminished with a further in-  crease of the number of turns. This was due to the increased resist-  ance which the longer wire offered to the conduction of electricity.  Two methods of improvement therefore suggested themselves. The  first consisted, not in increasing the length of the coil, bul in using  a number of separate coils on the same piece of iron. By this ar-  rangement the resistance to the conduction of the electricity was  diminished and a greater quantity made to circulate around the iron  from the same battery. The second method of producing a similar  result consisted in increasing the number of elements of the battery,  or, in other words, the projectile force of the electricity, which enabled  it to pass through an increased number of turns of wire, and thus,  by increasing the length of the wire, to develop  the maximum power of the iron.  To test these principles on a larger scale the  experimental magnet was constructed, which is  shown in figure 6. In this a number of com-  pound helices were placed on the same bar, their  ends left projecting, and so numbered that they  could be all united into one long helix, or va-  riously combined in sets of lessser length.  From a series of experiments with this and other magnets it was  proved that, in order to produce the greatest amount of magnetism  from a battery of a single cup, a number of helices is required ; but  when a compound battery is used then one long wire must be em-  ployed, making many turns around the iron, the length of wire and    PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS, 103  consequently the number of turns being commensurate with the pro-  jectile power of the battery.  In describing tbe results of my experiments the terms intensiiij and  quantity magnets were introduced to avoid circumlocution, and were  intended to be used merely in a technical sense. By the intensity  magnet I designated a piece of soft iron, so surrounded with wire  that its magnetic power could be called into operation by an intensity  battery, and by a quantity magnet, a piece of iron so surrounded by a  number of separate coils that its magnetism could be fully developed  by a quantity battery.  I was the first to point out this connexion of the two kinds of  the battery with the two forms of the magnet in my paper in Silli-  man's Journal, January 1831, and clearly to state that when mag-  netism was to be developed by means of a compound battery, one long  coil was to be employed, and when the maximum effect was to be pro-  duced by a single battery, a number of single strands were to be used.  These steps in the advance of electro-magnetism though sraall^ were  such as to interest and astonish the scientific world. With the same  ^attery used by Mr. Sturgeon, at least a hundred times more mag-  netism was produced than could have been obtained by his experiment.  The developments were considered at the time of much importance  in a scientific point of view, and they subsequently furnished the means  by which magneto-electricity, the phenomena of dia-magnetism, and  the magnetic efiects on polarized light were discovered. They gave  rise to the various forms of electro-magnetic machines which have  since exercised the ingenuity of inventors in every part of the world,  and were of immediate applicability in the introduction of the magnet  to telegraphic purposes. Neither the electro-magnet of Sturgeon nor  any electro-magnet ever made previous to my investigations wag  applicable to transmitting power to a distance.  The principles I have developed were properly appreciated by the  scientific mind of Dr. Gale, and applied by him to operate Mr. Morse's  machine at a distance.  Previous to my investigations the means of developing magnetism  in soft iron were imperfectly understood. The electro-magnet made  by Sturgeon, and copied by Dana, of New York, was an imperfect  quantity magnet, the feeble power of which was developed by a single  battery. It was entirely inapplicable to a long circuit with an inten-  sity battery, and no person possessing the requisite scientific know-   104 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS  ledge would have attempted to use it in that connexion after reading  my paper.  In sending a message to a distance two circuits are employed, the  first a long circuit through which the electricity is sent to the distant  station to bring into action the second, a short one, in which is the  local battery and magnet for working the machine. In order to give  projectile force sufficient to send the power to a distance, it is neces-  sary to use an intensity battery in the long circuit, and in connexion  with this, at the distant station, a magnet surrounded with many  turns of one long wire must be employed to receive and multiply the  efiect of the current enfeebled by its transmission through the long  conductor. In the local or short circuit either an intensity or a quan-  tity magnet may be employed. If the fi.rst be used^ then with it a  compound battery will be required ; and, therefore, on account of the  increased resistance due to the greater quantity of acid, a less amount  of work will be performed by a given amount of material ; and, con-  sequently, though this arrangement is practicable it is by no means  economical. In my original paper I state that the advantages of a  greater conducting power, from using several wires in the quantity  magnet, may, in a less degree, be obtained by substituting for them one  large wire ; but in this case, on account of the greater obliquity of  the spires and other causes, the magnetic effect would be less. In  accordance with these principles, the receiving magnet, or that which  is introduced into the long circuit, consists of a horse-shoe magnet  surrounded with many hundred turns of a single long wire, and is  operated with a battery of from 12 to 24 elements or more, while in  the local circuit it is customary to employ a battery of one or two  elements with a much thicker wire and fewer turns.  It will, I think, be evident to the impartial reader that these were  improvements in the electro-magnet which first rendered it adequate  to the transmission of mechanical power to a distance ; and had I  omitted all allusion to the telegraph in my paper, the conscientious  historian of science would have awarded me some credit, however  small might have been the advance which I made. Arago and Stur-  geon, in the accounts of their experiments, make no mention of the tel-  egraph, and yet their names always have been and will be associated  with the invention. I briefly, however, called attention to the fact of  the ap[)licability of my experiments to the construction of the tele-  graph ; but not being familiar with the history of the attempts made  in regard to this invention, I called it \"Barlow's project,\" while I ought  to have stated that Mr. Barlow's investigation merely tended to dis-  prove the possibility of a telegraph.   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 105  I did not refer exclusively to the needle telegraph when, in my  paper, I stated that the magnetic action of a current from a trough is at  least not sensibly diminished by passing through a long wire. This  is evident from the fact that the immediate experiment from which  this deduction was made was by means of an electro-magnet and not  by means of a needle galvanometer.  At the conclusion of the series of experiments which I described in  Silliman's Journal, there were two applications of the electro-magnet  in my mind : one the production of a machine to be moved by electro-  magnetism, and the other the transmission of or calling into action  power at a distance. The first was carried into execution in the con-  struction of the machine described in Silliman's Journal, vol. 20, 1831,  and for the purpose of experimenting in regard to the second, I ar-  ranged around one of the upper rooms in the Albany Academy a  wire of more than a mile in length, through which I was enabled to  make signals by sounding a bell, (fig. ^^- 'â€¢  7.) The mechanical arrangement for  afiecting this object was simply a  steel bar, permanently magnetized, of  about ten inches in length, supported  on a pivot and placed with its north  end between the two arms of a horse-  shoe magnet. When the latter was  excited by the current, the end of the  bar thus placed was attracted by one  arm of the borse-shoe, and repelled  by the other, and was thus caused to  move in a horizontal plane and its further extremity to strike a bell  suitably adjusted.  This arrangement is that which is alluded to in Professor Hall's  letter* as having been exhibited to him in 1832 It was not, however,  at that time connected with the long wire above mentioned, but with  a shorter one put up around the room for exhibition.  At the time of giving my testimony, I was uncertain as to when I  had first exhibited this contrivance, but have since definitely settled  the fact by the testimony of Hall and others that it was before I left  Albany, and abundant evidence can be brought to show that previous  to my going to Princeton in November, 1832, my mind was much  occupied with the subject of the telegraph, and that I introduced it in  my course of instruction to the senior class in the Academy, I should  * See the Report of the Committee, page 96, and Proceedings of the Albany Institute,  anuary, 1858.    106 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  state, however, that the arrangement that I have described was merely  a temporary one, and that I had no idea at the time of abandoning  my researches for the practical application of the telegraph. Indeed,  my experiments on the transmission of power to a distance were super-  seded by the investigation of the remarkable phenomena, which I had  discovered in the course of these experiments, of the induction of a  current in a long wire on itself, and of which I made the first mention  in a paper in Silliman's Journal in 1832, vol. 22.  I also devised a method of breaking a circuit, and thereby causing a  large weight to fall. It was intended to illustrate the practicabihty of  calling into action a great power at a distance capable of producing  mechanical effects ; but as a description of this was not printed, I do  not place it in the same category with the experiments of which I  published an account, or the facts which could be immediately de-  duced from my papers in Silliman's Journal.  From a careful investigation of the history of electro-magnetism  in its connexion with the telegraph, the following facts may be es-  tablished :  1. Previous to my investigations the means of developing magnetism  in soft iron were imperfectly understood, and the electro-magnet  which then existed was inapplicable to the transmission of power to a  distance.  2. I was the first to prove by actual experiment that, in order to  develop magnetic power at a distance, a galvanic battery of intensity  must be employed to project the current through the long conductor,  and that a magnet surrounded by many turns of one long wire must be  used to receive this current.  3 I was the first actually to magnetize a piece of iron at a distance,  and to call attention to the fact of the applicability of my experiments  to the telegraph.  4. I was the first to actually sound a bell at a distance by means of  the electro- magnet.  5. The principles I had developed were applied by Dr. Gale to  render Morse's machine effective at a distance.  The results here given were among my earliest experiments ; in a  Bcientific point of view I considered them of much less importance  than what I subsequently accomplished ; and had I not been called  upon to give my testimony in regard to them, I would have suffered  them to remain without calling public attention to them, a part of the  history of science to be judged of by scientific men who are the best  qualified to pronounce upon their merits.

[From the Record of the Supreme Court of the United States '\\  1. Please state your place of residence and your occupation ; also,  what attention, if any, you ha/e given to the subjects of electricity,  magnetism, and electro-magnetism.  Answer. â€” I begin tliis deposition with the express statement that I  do not voluntarily give my testimony ; but that I appear on legal  summons, and in submission to law. I am Secretary to the Smith-  sonian Institution^ established in the city of Washington, where I  now reside. The principal direction of the Institution is confided to  me. As I do not expect to return to Washington until some time in  October, I have been called upon to give my testimony here in Boston;  on this account I labor under the disadvantage of being obliged to  testily without my notes and papers, which are now in Washington.  I commenced the study of electro-magnetism in 1827 ; and since then  have, at different times, [until] within the last two and a half years,  when I became Secietary of the Smithsonian Institution, made original  investigations in this and kindred branches of physical science. I know  no person in our country who has paid more attention to the study of  the principles of electro-magnetism than myself.  2. Please give a general account of the progress of the science of  electro magnetism, as connected with telegraphic communication ; and  of any inventions or discoveries in electro-magnetism applicable to  the telegraph, made by yourself.  Ansioer. â€” I consider an electromagnetic telegraph as one v^^hich  operates by the combined influence of electricity and magnetism. Prior  to tUe winter of 181'J-'20, no form of the electro-magnetic telegraph  was possible ; the scientific principles on which it is founded were  then unknown. The first fact of electro-magnetism was discovered  by Oersted, of Copenhagen, during that winter. It is this : A wire  being placed close above, or below, and parallel to a magnetic needle,  and a galvanic current being transmitted through the wire, the needle  will tend to place itself at right ana:les to it. This fact was widely  published, and the account was everywhere received with interest.  The second fact of importance was discovered independently, and  about the same time, by Arago, at Paris, and Davy, at London. It  is this : During the transmission of a galvanic current through a wire  of copper, or any other metal, the wire exhibits magnetic properties,  attracting iron, but not copper filings, and having the power of in-  ducing permanent magnetism in steel needles. The next important  fact was discovered by Ampere, of Paris, one of the most sagacious  and successful cultivators of physical science in the present century.  It is this : Two parallel wires through which galvanic currents are  passing ia. the same direction, attract each olher ; but if the currents   108 PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS.  pass in opposite directions, they repel each other. On this fact  Ampere founded his ingenious theory of magnetism and electro-mag-  netism. According to this thejry, all magnetic phenomena result  from the attraction or repulsion of electric currents, supposed to exist  in the iron at right angles to the length of the bar ; and that all the  phenomena of magnetism and electro magnetism are thus referred to  one principle, namely, the action of electrical currents on each other.  Ampere deduced from this theory many interesting results, which  were afterwards verified by experiment. He also proposed to the  French Academy a plan for the application of electro-magnetism to  the transmission of intelligence to a distance ; this consisted in de-  flecting a number of needles at the place of receiving intelligence, by  galvanic currents transmitted through long wires. This transmission  was to be effected by completing a galvanic circuit. When completed,  the needle was deflected. When interrupted, it returned to its ordi-  nary position, under the influence of the attraction of the earth. This  project of Ampere was never reduced to practice. All these discoveries  and results were prior to 1823.  The next investigations relating to the magnetic telegraph were  published in 1825 ; they were by Mr. Barlow, of the Royal Military  Academy of Woolwich, England. He found that there was great  diminution in the power of the galvanic current to produce effects  with an increase of distance; a diminution so great in a distance of  two hundred feet was observed, as to convince him of the impractica-  bility of the scheme of the electro-magnetic telegraph. His experi-  ments led him to conclude that the power was inversely as the  square root of the length of the wire. The publication of these  results put at rest, for a time, all attempts to construct an electro-  magnetic telegraph.  The next investigations, in the order of time, bearing on the tele-  graph, were made by Mr. Sturgeon, of England. He bent a piece of  iron wire into the form of a horse-shoe, and put loosely around it a  coil of copper wire, with wide intervals between the turns or spires  to prevent them touching each other, and through this coil he trans-  mitted a current of galvanism. The iron, under the influence of this  current, became magnetic, and thus was produced the first electro-  magnetic magnet, sometimes called simply the electro-magnet. An  account of this experiment was first published in November, 1825, in  the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in  England ; and was made known in this country through the Annals  of Philosophy for November, 1826.  Nothing further was done pertaining to the telegraph until my  own researches in electro-magnetism, which were commenced in 1828,  and continued in 1829, 1830, and subsequently ; Barlow's results, as  I before observed, had prevented all attempts to construct a magnetic  telegraph on the plan of Ampere, and our own knowledge of the de-  velopment' of magnetism in soft iron, as left by Sturgeon, was not  such as to be applicable to telegraphic purposes. The electro-magnet  of Sturgeon could not be made to act by a current through a long  wire, as will be apparent hereafter in this deposition.  After repeating the experiments of Oersted, Ampere, and others,  and publishing an account in IBzS of various modifications of electro-   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 109  maojnetic apparatus, I commenced in that year the investigation of  the laws of the development of magnetism in soft iron, by means of  the electrical current. The first idea that occurred to me in accord-  ance with the theory of Ampere, with reference to increasing the  power of the electro-magnet, was that of using a longer wire than  had before been employed. A wire of sixty feet in length, covered  with silk, was wound round a whole length of an iron bar, either  straight or in the form of a U, so as to cover its whole length with  several thicknesses of the wire.  The results of this arrangement were such as I had anticipated,  and electro-magnets of this kind, exhibited to the Albany Institute  in March, 1829, possessed magnetic power superior to that of any  before known.  The idea afterwards occurred to me that the quantity of galvanism,  supplied by a small galvanic battery, might be applied to develop a  still greater amount of magnetic power in a large bar of iron. On  experiment, I found this idea correct. A battery of two and a half  square inches of zinc, developed magnetism in a large bar sufficient to  lift fourteen pounds.  The next suggestion which occurred to me was that of using a  number of wires of the same length around the same bar, so as to  lessen the resistance which the galvanic current experienced in pass-  ing from the zinc to the copper through the coil. To bring this to  the test of experiment, a second wire, equal in length to the first,  was wound around the last mentioned magnet, and its ends soldered  to the plates of the same battery.  The magnet with this additional wire lifted twenty-eight pounds,  or, in other words, its power was doubled.  A series of experiments was afterwards made, to determine the re-  sistance to conduction of wires of different lengths and diameters, and  the proper lengths and number of wires for producing, with different  kinds of galvanic batteries, the maximum of amount of magnetic de-  velopment with a given quantity of zinc surface. For this purpose a  bar of soft iron, two inches square and twenty inches long, weighing  twenty-one pounds, and much larger than any before used, was bent  in the form of a horse-shoe. Around this were wound nine strands  of copper wire, each sixty feet long, the ends left projecting so that  one or more coils could be used at once, either connected with a bat-  tery or with each other, thus forming several coils with several battery  connexions, or one long coil with single battery connexions. The  greatest effect obtained with this magnet, using a battery of a single  pair, with a zinc plate of two-fifths of a square foot of surface, and all  the wire arranged as separate coils, was to lift a weight of six hun-  dred and fifty pounds ; with a large battery the effect was increased  to seven hundred and fifty pounds. In a subsequent series of experi-  ments, not published with the preceding, the same magnet was made  to sustain one thousand pounds. When a compound battery was  employed of a number of pairs, it was found that the greatest effect  was produced when all the wires were arranged as a single long coil.  I subsequently constructed electro-magnets on the same plan, which  supported much greater weights. One of these, now in the cabinet  of Princeton, will sustain three thousand six hundred pounds with a   110 PROCEEDINGS OF THE EEGENTS.  battery occupying about a cubic foot of space. It consists of tbirty  strands of wire, each about forty feet in length.  The abovementioned experiments exhibit the important fact that  when a galvanic battery of intensity (that is to say, a battery con-  sisting of a number of pairs) is employed, the electro-magnet con-  nected with it must be wound with one long wire, in order to produce  the greatest effect ; and that when a battery of quantity, (that is, one  of a single pair,) is employed, the proper form of the magnet con-  nected with it is that in which several shorter wires are w^ound around  the iron. The first of these magnets, which is the one now employed  in the long or main circuit of the telegraph, may be called an intensity  magnet ; and the second, which is used in the local circuit, may be  denominated the quantity.  The quantity of electricity which can be passed through a long  circuit of ordinary-sized wire is, under the most favorable circum-  stances, exceedingly small, and in order that this may develop mag-  netism in a bar of iron, it was necessary that it should be made to  revolve many times around the iron, that its effects may be multiplied ;  and this is effected by using along single coil. Hence it will be seen  that the electro-magnet of Mr. Sturgeon was not applicable to tele-  graphic purposes in a long circuit.  Previous to making the last experiments abovementioned, in order  to guide myself, I instituted a series of preliminary experiments on  the conduction of wires of different lengths and diameters, with dif-  ferent batteries. In these experiments a galvanometer, or aa instru-  ment consisting of a magnetic needle freely suspended within a coil  of wire, was first employed to denote, by the deflectioa of its needle,  the power of the current. The result from a number of experiments,  with a battery of a single pair, was the same as that obtained by  Barlow, namely, tbat the power diminished rapidly with the increase  of distance With the same battery, and a larger wire, the diminution  was less. The galvanometer was next removed, and a small electro-  magnet subslituttd in its place. With a single battery, the same  result was again obtained â€” a great diminution of lifting power with  the increase of distance. After this the battery of a single pair was  removed and its place supi)lied by one ot intensity, consisting of  twenty-five pairs. With this the important fact was observed^ that  no perceptible diminution of the lifting power took place, when the  current was transmitted through an intervening wire between the  battery and the magnet of upwards of one thousand feet.  This was the first discovery of the fact that a galvanic current  could be transmitted to a great distance with so little a diminution of  force as to produce mechanical effects, and of the means by which the  transmission could be accomplished. I saw that the electric tele-  graph was now practicable ; and, in publishing my experimenis and  their results, I stated that the fact just mentioned was applicable to  Barlow's project of such a telegraph. I had not the paper ot Barlow  before me, and erred in attributing to him a project of a telegraph, as  he only disproved, as he thought, the practicability of one. But the  intention of the statement was to show that I had established the fact  that a mechanical effect could be produced by the galvanic current at   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. Ill  a great distance, operating upon a magnet or needle, and that the  telegraph was therefore possible. In arriving at these results, and  announcing their applicability to the telegraph, I had not in mind  any particular form of telegraph, but referred only to the general fact  that it was now demonstrated that a galvanic current could be trans-  mitted to great distances with sufficient power to produce mechanical  effects adequate to the desired object.  The investigations above mentioned were all devised and originated,  and the experiments planned, by myself. In conducting the latter,  however, I was assisied by Dr. Philip Ten Eyck, of Albany. An  account of the whole was published in the 19th volume of Silliman's  Journal, in 1831, with the exception of the account of the large  magnet afterwards constructed at Princeton in 1833, and the experi-  ment mentioned of lifting a thousand pounds with one of my first  magnets. While I was engaged in these researches. Prof. Moll, of  the University of Utrecht, was pursuing investigations somewhat  similar, and succeeded in making powerful electro-magnets, but made  no discovery as to the distinction between the two kinds of magnets,  or the transmissibility of the galvanic current to a great distance with  power to produce mechanical effects. In fact, his experiments were  but a repetition on a large scale of those of Sturgeon.  After completing the investigations abovementioned, I commenced  a series of experiments on another branch of electricity closely con-  nected with this subject. Among other things, I applied the princi-  ples above mentioned to the construction of an electro-magnetic  machine, which has since excited much attention in reference to the  application of electro-magnetism as a motive power in the arts.  In 1832 I was called to the chair of natural philosophy in the  College of New Jersey, at Princeton, and in my first course of lectures -  in that institution, in 1833, and in every subsequent year during my  connexion with that institution, I mentioned the project of the electro-  magnetic telegraph, and explained how the electro-magnet might be  used to produce mechanical effects at a distance adequate to making  signals of various kinds. I never myself attempted to reduce these  principles to practice, or to apply any of my discoveries to processes  in the arts. My whole attention, exclusive of my duties to the college,  was devoted to original scientific investigations, and I left to others  what I considered in a scientific view of subordinate importance the  application of my discoveries to useful purposes in the arts. Besides  this, I partook of the feeling common to men of science, which disin-  clines them to secure to themselves the advantages of their discoveries  by a patent.  In February, 1837, I went to Europe ; and early in April of that  year Prof. Wheatstone, of Loudon, in the course of a visit to him in  King's College, London, with Prof. Bacne, now of the Coast Survey,  explained to us his plans of an electro-magnetic telegraph ; and^ among  other things, exhibited to us his method of bringing into action a  second galvanic circuit. This consisted in closing the second circuit  by the deflection of a needle, so placed that the two ends projecting  upwards, of the open circuit, would be united by the contact of the  ond of the needle when deflected, and on opening or breaking of the   112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  circuit so closed by opening the first circuit, and thus interrupting the  current, when the needle would resume its ordinary position under  the inflaence of the magnetism of the earth. I informed him that I  had devised another method of producing effects somewhat similar.  This consisted in opening the circuit of my large quantity magnet at  Princeton, when loaded with many hundred pounds weight, by at-  tracting upward a small piece of moveable wire, with a small intensity  magnet, connected with a long wire circuit. When the circuit of the  large battery was thus broken by an action from a distance, the  weights would fall, and great mechanical effect could thus be pro-  duced, such as the ringing of church bells at a distance of a hundred  miles or more, an illustration which I had previously given to my  class at Princeton. My impression is strong, that I had explained  the precise process to my class before I went to Europe, but testifying  now without the opportunity of reference to my notes, I cannot speak  positively. I am, however, certain of having mentioned in my lectures  every year previously, at Princeton, the project of ringing bells at a  distance, by the use of the electro-magnet, and of having frequently  illustrated the principle of transmitting power to a distance to my  class, by causing in some cases a thousand pounds to fall on the floor,  by merely lifting a piece of wire from two cups of mercury closing the  circuit.  The object of Prof. Wheatstone, as I understood it, in bringing into  action a second circuit, was to provide a remedy for the diminution of  force in a long circuit. My object, in the process described by me, was  to bring into operation a large quantity magnet, connected with a  quantity battery in a local circuit, by means of a small intensity  magnet, and an intensity battery at a distance.  The only other scientific facts of importance to the practical opera-  tion of the telegraph not already mentioned are the discovery by  Steinheil, iu 1837, in Germany, of the practicability of completing a  galvanic circuit, by using the earth for completing the circuit, and  the construction of the constant battery in 1836, or about that time,  by Professor Daniell, of King's College, London. I believe that I was  the first to repeat the experiments of Steinheil and Daniell in this  country. I stretched a wire from my study to my laboratory, through  a distance in the air of several hundred yards, and used the earth  as a return conductor, with a very minute battery, the negative ele-  ment of which was a common pin, such as is used in dress, and the  positive element the point of a zinc wire immersed in a single drop of  acid. With this arrangement, a needle was deflected in my laboratory  before my class. I afterwards transmitted currents in various direc-  tions through the college grounds at Princeton. The exact date of  these experiments I am unable to give without reference to my notes.  They were previous, however, to the unsuccessful attempt of Mr. Morse  to transmit currents of electricity through wires buried in the earth  between Washington and Baltimore, and before he attempted to use  the earth as a part of the circuit. Previous to this time, and after the  abovementioned experiments, Mr. Morse visited meat Princeton, to  consult me on the arrangement of his conductors. During this visit,  we conversed freely on the subject of insulation and conduction of   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 113  wires. I urged him to put his wires on poles, and stated to him my  experiments and their results.  In the course of the years 1836 and 18S7, various plans of more or  less merit, were devised, and more or less fully carried into effect, for  applying the principles already discovered to the construction of electro-  magnetic telegraphs in different parts of the world, but of these 1 do  not undertake to give any particular account. I would say, however,  that of these plans that for which Mr. Morse subsequently obtained a  patent was, in my judgment, the best.  3. Please state whether or not you are acquainted with the electro-  magnetic telegraph for which S. F. B. Morse obtained a patent in  1846. If you are, please state whether any, and if any, which of the  principles or plans which you have described as discovered, or an-  nounced by yourself or others are used in the construction or opera-  tion of it. State also what principles used in the telegraph are, so  far as you know, original with Professor Morse.  Ansiver. â€” I am acquainted with the principles and general mode of  operation of the telegraph and improvement referred to. The tele-  graph is based upon the facts discovered by myself and others, of  which I have already given an account.  The plan which was first described to me in the autumn of 1837 by  Mr. Morse, or by Professor Gale, who was associated with him in the  construction of the telegraph, was to employ a single entire circuit of  wire, with an intensity battery to excite the current, and an intensity  magnet to receive it and produce a mechanical action, which would  work the recording apparatus. Mr. Morse afterwards employed the  intensity battery in a long circuit, and an intensity magnet to receive  its current at a distant point, and produce the mechanical effect of  closing a secondary circuit. The secondary circuit may be either em-  ployed to transmit a second current to a distant point and there close  a third circuit, and thus continue the line, or for working a recording  apparatus in the secondary circuit, or it may be employed without  reference to the continuation of the line, as a short local circuit to work  a local magnet. In the first case, there must be in the secondary cir-  cuit an intensity battery and intensity magnet; in the last case, a quan-  tity magnet and quantity battery are required.  I heard nothing of the secondary circuit as a part of Mr. Morse's  plan until after his return from Europe, whither he went in 1838. It  was not till long after this that Mr. Morse used the earth as a part of  the circuit in accordance with the discovery of Steinheil.  I am not aware that Mr. ]\\Iorse ever made a single original dis-  covery, in electricity, magnetism, or electro-magnetism, applicable to  the invention of the telegraph. I have always considered his merit  to consist in combining and applying the discoveries of others in the  invention of a particular instrument and process for telegraphic pur-  I)Oses. I have no means of determining how far this invention is  original with himself, or how much is due to those associated with him.  4. Please state when you first became acquainted with Mr. Morse,  and what knowledge he possessed of electricity, magnetism, and  8 s   114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  electro-magnetism, and what information yon or others commu-  nicated to him relating to the telegraph. State, also, all you know  of the attempts of himself^ and others associated with him, to construct  an electro-magnetic telegraph, either from your own observation or  from statements made by himself or by others in your presence.  State particularly any conversation, if any, you may have had with  him in reference to your own discoveries applied to the telegraph.  Ansiver. â€” Shortly after my return from Europe, in the autumn of  1837, I learned that Mr. Morse was about to petition Congress for  assistance in constructing the electro-magnetic telegraph. Some of  my friends in Princeton, knowing what I had done in developing the  principles of the telegraph, urged me to make the representations to  Congress, which I expressed some thought of doing, namely : that  the principles of the electro-magnetic telegraph belonged to the  science of the world, and that any appropriation which might be  made by Congress should be a premium for the best plan, and the  means of testing the same, which the ingenuity of the country might  offer. Shortly after this I visited New York, and there accidentally  made the personal acquaintance of Mr. Morse ;* he appeared to be an  unassuming and prepossessing gentleman, with very little knowledge  of the general jjrinciples of electricity, magnetism, or electro-magnet-  ism. He made no claims, in conversation with me to any scientific  discovery, or to anything l3eyond his particular machine and process  of applying known principles to telegraphic purposes. He explained  to me his plan of a telegraph with which he had recently made a  successful experiment ; I thought this plan better than any with  which I had been made acquainted in Europe ; I became interested  in him, and instead of interfering in his application to Congress, I  [subsequentlyt] gave him a certificate, in the form of a letter, stating  my confidence in the practicability of the electro-magnetic telegraph  and my belief that the form proposed by himself was the best which  had been published.  Mr. Morse subsequently visited Princeton several times to confer  with me on the principles of electricity and magnetism which might  be applicable to the telegraph. I freely gave him any information I  possessed.  I learned in 1837, or thereabouts, that Professor Gale and Dr.  Fisher were the scientific assistants of Mr. Morse in preparing the  telegraph.- Mr. Vail was also employed, but I know not in what  capacity, and I am not personally acquainted with him. With Pro-  fessor Gale I have been intimately acquainted for several years ; he  had been a pupil in chemistry of my friend Dr. Torrey, and had  studied my papers on electro-magnetism, and, as he informed me,  had a[)plied them in the arrangement of the apparatus for the con-  struction of Morse's telegraph.  My researches had been given to the world several years before the  attempt was made to reduce the magnetic telegraph to practice. Mr.  * This meeting took place in the chemical store of Mr. Cliilton, Broadway, New York,  and the place and time are both indelibly impressed upon my mind.  t The word subsequently was accidentally omitted in giving my testimony. The omission,  however, is of little importance.   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 115  Cliilton, of New York, informed me that he had referred Mr. Morse  to them previous to his experiments in the New York University. I  was therefore much surprised on the publication, in 1845, of a work  purporting to give a history of the telegraph, and of the principles on  which it was founded, by Mr. Vail, then principal assistant of Mr.  Morse, and one of the proprietors of his patent, to find all my  published researches relating to the telegraph passed over with little  more than the remark that Dr. Moll and myself had made large  electro-magnetic magnets. Presuming that this publication was  authorized by Mr. Morse and the proprietors of the telegraph, I com-  plained to some of his friends of the injustice, and after his return  trom Europe, (for he was absent at the time the book was issued,) I  received a letter, copied and signed by Mr. Vail, but written by Mr.  Morse, as the latter afterwards informed me, excusing the publication,  on the ground that he (Mr. Vail) was ignorant of what I had done,  and asking me for an account of my researches. This letter was  addressed to me after the book had been stereotyped and widely  circulated. It has been translated into French, and, I believe,  published in Paris. To the letter I did not think fit to make  any reply. I afterwards received a letter from Mr. Morse, in his  own name, on the same subject, to which I gave a verbal reply in  January, 1847, in Washington. In this interview Mr. Morse acknow-  ledged that injustice had been done me, but said that proper repara-  tion would be made. Another issue of the same work was made,  b<>aring date 1847, in which there is no change in the statement  relative to my researches.  About the beginning of 1848 Mr. Walker, of the Coast Survey, in  a report on the application of the telegraph to the determination of  differences of longitude, alluded to my researches. A copy of this  was sent to Mr. Morse, which led to an interview between Mr. Walker,  Professor Gale, Mr. Morse, and myself. At this meeting, which took  place at my office in Washington, Mr. Morse stated that he had not  known until reading my paper in January, 1847, that I had two years  before his first conception in 1832, settled the point of practicability  of the telegraph, and shown how mechanical effects could be produced  at a distance, both in the deflection of a needle and in the action of an  electro-magnet; that he did not know, at the time of his experiments  in 1837 that there had been any doubts of the action of a current at  a distance, and that in the confidence of the persuasion that the effect  could be produced, he had devised the proper apparatus by which his  telegraph was put in operation. Professor Gale, being then referred  to, stated that Mr. Morse had forgotten the precise state of the case;  that he, (Mr. Morse,) previous to his, (Dr. Gale's,) connexion with  him, had not succeeded in producing effects at a distance; that, when  he was first called in he found Mr. Morbe attempting to make an  electro-magnet act through a circuit of a few yards of copper wire  suspended around a room in the University of New York, and that  he could not succeed in producing the desired effect even in this  that circuit; that he (Dr. Gale) asked him if he had studied Prof.  Henry's paper on the subject, and that the answer was \"no;\" that  he then informed Mr. Morse that he would find the principles   116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  necessary to success explained in that paper; that instead of the  battery of a single element, he should employ one of a number of  pairs ; and that, in place of the magnet with a short single wire, he  should use one with a long coil. Dr. Gale further stated that his  apparatus was in the same building, and that having articles of- the  kind he had mentioned, he procured them, and that with these the  action was produced through a circuit of half a mile of wire.* To this  statement Mr. Morse made no reply. The interview then terminated,  and I have since had no further communication with him on the subject.  5. Please state whether or not you ever constructed any machine  for producing motion by magnetic attraction and repulsion ; if yea,  what was it, and what led to the making of it.  Answer. â€” After developing the great magnetic power of the electro-  magnet as already described, the thought occurred to me that this  power might be applied to give motion to a machine. The simplest  arrangement which suggested itself to my mind was one already re-  ferred to, namely, causing a movable bar, supported on a horizontal  axis like a scale beam, to be attracted and repelled by two permanent  magnets. This could be readily effected by transmitting through a  coil of wire around the suspended bar a current of galvanism, first in  one direction, and then in the opposite direction, the alternations of  the current being produced by dipping the ends of wires projecting  from the coils into cups of mercury connected with batteries, one on  either side. An account of tliis was published in Silliman's Journal,  for 1831, vol. XX., p. 340. It was the first successful attempt to pro-  duce a mechanical motion which might apparently be employed in  the arts as a motive power. This little machine attracted much atten-  tion at home and abroad, and various modifications of it were made  by myself and others. I never, however, regarded it as practically  applicable in the arts, because of the great expense of producing  power by this means, except, perhaps, in particular cases where ex-  pense of power is of little consequence.  6. Please look at the drawings of the Columbian telegraph, now  shown you, marked G. W. B. and N. B. C, and certified by G. S. Hil-  lard, Commissioner. Describe generally the apparatus represeated  and its mode of operation, and state in what respects, if any, it differs  from the telegraphic apparatus patented by Mr. Morse.  Answer. â€” I have looked at the drawings, and I find, on examina-  tion, that it will be impossible for me to give a definite answer to the  question, unless I have more time than is now at my disposal, and  the means of examining and comparing the operations of the  machines.  7. Please state, if you can, how many original experiments you  have made in the course of your investigations in electricity, mag-  netism, and electro-magnetism.  Answer. â€” The experiments I have mentioned in this deposition  form but a small part of my original investigations. Besides many  * See Dr. ale's letter of April 7, 1856, page 93.

Many  of these have not been published in detail. They have cost me years  of labor and much expense.  The only reward I ever expected was the consciousness of advancing  science, the pleasure of discovering new truths, and the scientific  reputation to which these labors would entitle me.

LECTURES ON COAL.   BY PROFESSOR JOSEPH LB CONTE,   Nature is a book in whicli are revealed the divine character and  mind. Science is the human interpretation of this divine hook, liu-  man attempts to understand the thoughts and plans of Deity. The  hook being divine, it is evident that all parts are equally sacred.  The subjects of all sciences may be said to be equally, because they  are all infinitely, noble. To the scientific mind the organization of an  insect, a polyp, or an infusorial animalcule is no less dignified a sub-  ject of human inquiry than the organization of the solar system. Yet,  as in the Sacred Scriptures, while all parts are equally sacred, because  all are divine, some are cherished with peculiar reverence, as giving  nobler conceptions of divine character, or clearer views of human duty.  So also in science there are some branches which, by a certain magni-  tude in the objects with which they deal, strike the imagination and  kindle the enthusiasm in a peculiar degree. From a purely abstract  or intellectual point of view they may be all equal, but as human stu-  dies, as means of elevating the mind and ennobling the soul, they  differ very much among themselves.  In this, the noblest function of science, there are two departments  which stand out beyond all others, viz : astronomy and geology. We  are all accustomed to look upon astronomy as the most magnificent of  sciences, as more than all others extending the bounds of human  intellectual vision ; but I am perfectly confident that when the age  has grasped as firmly and apprehended as clearly the fundamental  idea of geology as it has already done that of astronomy, all will  agree with me in thinking that the former is not one whit behind the  latter in the overwhelming grandeur of its conceptions. Let us, then,  compare these two noble sciences. Let us attempt to vindicate the  claims of geology to stand beside astronomy in the very first rank of  sciences as twin sisters, distinguished from all others by superior  beauty and dignity.  There are two conditions of material existence, viz : space and time.  We cannot conceive of material existence except under these two con-  ditions. Now, the peculiar province of astronomy is space, as that of  geology is time. Other sciences may have to do with space, limited  space, a portion of space, but it belongs to astronomy alone to deal  with infinite space. So also there are other sciences which necessarily  deal with limited time, but it is the peculiar prerogative of geology to  deal with infinite time.* As astromy is limited in time to the present  epoch, or, in fact, to about two thousand years, but unlimited in space,  so also geology is limited in space to the surface of the earth, but un-  limited in time. As astronomy measures her distances by billions of   * We use the term \" wylm^e\" with reference to time, as with reference to space, as synony-  mous with inconceivahhj great, illimitable by human conception.   1'20 LECTURES  miles, or millions of earth radii, so geology her epochs hy millions  of years, i. e., earth revolutions. As the astronomer takes the ra-  dius of the earth as a base line wherewith to measure the dimensions  of the solar system, so the geologist takes the present geological  epoch, and \" causes now in operation,\" as a time measuring rod, with  which to estimate the length of the tertiary period. As the astrono-  mer, becoming more bold as he ascends, takes the diameter of the  earth's orbit as a line wherewith to calculate the distances of the fixed  stars, or even dares to estimate the probable distance of the remotest  nebula, so the geologist, no less daring, takes the tertiary as a rod  wherewith to measure approximatively the almost inconceivable lapse  of time represented by the secondary rocks, or even dares to cast his  telescopic glance back into the dim nebulosity of the remotest palaeo-  zoic period. Finally, as the astronomer _, when telescopic vision fails,  still speculates, though filled with awe, concerning the infinite, un-  known abyss of space beyond, so also the geologist, when mile-stones  are no longer visible^ when fossils and stratified rocks fail, still vainly  peers with wondering gaze backward, and strives to pierce the dark-  ness beyond, still believes that all he sees, or can ever hope to see, is  but a fragment of the infinite abyss of time beyond. Overwhelmed,  appalled, he shrinks back within himself, and remembers that his own  mind, so daring, so arrogant, so apparently limitless, is also but a  fragment of the infinite intelligence.  Thus, while astronomy fills the regions of the universe with objects,  geology fills the regions of infinite duration with events. As astronomy  carries us upwards by the relations of geometry, geology carries us  backwards by the relations of cause and efi'ect. As astronomy steps  irom point to point of the universe by a chain of triangles, so geology  stej)s trom epoch to epoch of the earth's history by a chain of me-  chanical and organical laws. If one depend on the axioms of geome-  try, the other depends upon the axioms of causation. In a word, the  realm of astronomy is the universe of space, that of geology the uni-  verse of time. The one peoples her universe with space-ivorlds , the  other her's with creations â€” time-ioorlds.  The great object of all science is to establish the universality of law ;  harmony in the midst of apparent confusion ; unity in the midst of  diversity; unity of force amidst diversity of phenomena, physical sci-  ence ; unity of plan in the midst of diversity of expression, natural  science. Now, it is the peculiar province of astronomy to establish  this universality of law throughout all space^ as it is of geology  throughout all time. Astronomy shows that the same force which  controls the falling of a stone governs the motions of the heavenly  bodies ; so also geology shows that the changes through which each  animal passes in its embryonic development are similar to those  through which the whole earth and its inhabitants have passed in  the course of its geological history; that the same mind which now  conducts the one has presided through all time over the other. If  astronomy, more than all other sciences, illustrates that sublime attri-  bute of Deity, His omnipresence or unchangeableness in space, geology,  more than all other sciences, illustrates that other sublime attribute  of Deity, His immutability or unchangeableness in time.   ON COAL. 121  There are in the history of science two eras which, more than all  others, strike the imagination and fill the mind with admiration. Or  rather, I should say, two moments, the greatest in the intellectual  h'story of the human race. They are those in w^hich were horn in  the mind of man the fundamental ideas of astronomy and geology â€”  the ideas of infinite space and infinite time, containing other worlds  and other creations. You have all, probably, thought of the sublimity  of that moment when the idea of infinite space, peopled with worlds  like our own, was first thoroughly realized by the mind of man. You  have all, probably, shared in imagination the exstacy of Galileo as  gazing with awe through the first telescope, the phases of Venus and  the satellites of Jupiter suddenly revealed to him the existence of  other worlds besides his own. Before that pregnant moment our own  was alone in the universe. Sun, moon, and stars were but satellites  to the earth. Astronomy was but the geometry of the heavens ; the  geometry ot the curious lines which these ^'' luandering fires\" traced  upon the crystalline concave of the skies. In an instant the great  fundamental idea of modern astronomy was born in the mind of  Galileo. In an instant man's intellectual vision is infinitely extended,  but his own world, before so great, has shrunk into an atom in the  midst of infinite space ; has become a younger sister, a comparatively  insignificant member in a great family of worlds.  We have all been accustomed to look upon this as the grandest  moment in the intellectual history of man. But there is another  moment less known, or if known^ less thought of, because less under-  stood and less appreciated^ but not less grand. It is that in which  was born in the mind of man the fundamental idea of geology ; in  which the idea of other time-worlds besides our own entered the mind  of the aged Bufi'on.  For many years, indeed centuries, it had been observed that organic  remains, particularly marine shells, might be found far inland, and  even high up the slopes of mountains. There was much speculation  among scientific men as to the origin of these shells. They were  attributed by some to the deluge, by others more truly to gradual and  permanent changes in the relative level of sea and laud. But no one  for a moment supposed that they belonged to any period anterior to  the present epoch. Some may have supposed that they were extending  the known limits of the present epoch, that they were discovering new  continents in the ocean of time, but never dreamed that these were  the evidences of a neiu icorld in the infinite abyss of time. Buftbn  himself had taken active part in these discussions. Finally, near the  end of the last century, and in the evening of his great and long life,  a large number of these remains, both marine shells and mammalian  vertebrates, larger than he had ever examined before, were placed at  his disposal and subject to his inspection. To his astonishment he  found them entirely different from species now inhabiting the earth.  In that moment, in the mind of the venerable Buffon, suddenly, like  Minerva from the head of Jove, was born the idea of infinite time  containing successive creations. In an instant man's intellectual  vision was again infinitely extended ; but his own world again  dwindled into a single day in the geological history of the earth.   122 LECTURES  The whole future of geology was seen in the vision of that moment.  Filled with awe, the old man, then over 80 years of age, published  his discovery. In a kind of sacred phrenzy he spoke of the magnifi-  cence of the prospect, and prophesied of the future glories of this new  science, which he was, alas, too old to pursue. Thus, to the last, his  dying hand pointed the way, and his dying voice kindled the enthu-  siasm of those whom he could no longer lead.  Picture for a moment to yourself the aged Buffon thus gazing in  rapture, silent and alone, upon this new world suddenly opened to his  intellectual vision. I cannot help comparing him to Moses of old on  the top of Pisgah. Like Moses, he had reached the extreme verge of  mortal life ; like him, he stood upon a mount, raised far above the  rest of the world by the eminence of his intellectual position ; like  him, he gazed with sacred solemn joy, mingled with sadness, upon a  new world, a promised land, which he was forbidden to enter ; and,  like him, also, he died there upon the mount, prophesying of the  future glories of the new land, and calling upon his followers to enter  in and take possession.  One more comparison between these two noble sciences : In com-  paring modern with ancient or even mediasval civilization, nothing  is more striking or more significant than the difference in the manner  in which nature is viewed in relation to man. The spirit of the older  civilization tended to exalt man in his own estimation and to degrade  nature, while that of modern civilization tends to humiliate by  insisting upon his insignificance in comparison with the greatness  of nature. In art this is seen in the gradual but constant increase  in the contemplation of nature, both in painting and poetry. An  increasing love of wilderness and mountain, of rock and crag, of cloud  and sky. In science it is still more distinctly seen in the amazing  progress of the physical and natural sciences. The mind of man has  gradually passed from the study and contemplation of itself to the  study and contemplation of nature. We believe this was a necessary,  but cannot believe that it is a final change. When, by the study of  external nature, a true and solid foundation is laid for philosophy, the  human mind will again return to the study and contemplation of  itself, as the greatest of nature's works.  Now, it has already been seen, that among the most efficient agents  in bringing about this great and necessary change have been the  sciences of astronomy and geology. Nothing has tended so much to  humiliate the pride of man as the recognition of the astounding fact  that Ids habitation, Ms luoiid, is but an atom among millions of simi-  lar atoms in the boundless realms of space ; and that his time, the  life of his race, is but a day in the immeasurable cycle of geological  changes. But there is this great difference between the two sciences,  that while astronomy leaves man thus humiliated, prostrate, and  hopeless, geology lifts him up and restores him to his dignity. While  astronomy gives no evidence of the superiority of the earth to other  heavenly bodies, or of man above other possible material intelli-  gences â€” gives no hint of the superior dignity of our world among  other space-worlds â€” geology most distinctly declares the superior  dignity of our time world, and of our race, among all other time-   ON COAL. 123  worlds and their races. She teaches unmlstakeably that there has  been a gradual course of preparation for the present epoch ; that there  is an unity of plan in the whole system of time-worlds ; that, in a  certain sense, they are all satellites to ours ; that they are all bound  together by a force ; that force the plans of the Almighty, and its  centre the present epoch. Thus man becomes the centre of the  universe of time. Thus, also, by analogy we are led to suspect that  there may be a similar unity in the system of space-worlds also,  and that ours may, and probably does, enjoy a superiority, if not in  size at least in organization, and therefore in the intelligence of its  inhabitants. Thus man's dignity is restored, or rather, I should say,  dignity is given in place of pride. \" Pride goeth before a fall,\" but  dignity comes after.  But it will no doubt be objected by many that the position of a  science depends not only upon the dignity of its subjects, but also, in  no small degree, upon the certainty of its conclusions, and that, in  this respect, astronomy is far superior. But even this is a mistake,  the result of misconception. Even here the superiority of astronomy  has been very much exaggerated. Astronomy has its hypotheses and  uncertainties as well as geology ; and, on the other hand, geology has  its certainties as well as astronomy ; only it has happened, in this as  well as in many other cases, that the wisdom of age has given false  dignity to its errors and follies, while the wildness of youth has dis-  credited its wisdom. The certainties of astronomy have given an  appearance of truth to its wildest hypotheses, while the hypotheses of  geology have unjustly thrown some discredit upon her truest theories  and most certain iacts. The certainties of astronomy are the form,  size, weight, distance, and relative position of her space-worlds. Her  uncertainties are their physical geography, climate, and, more than  all, their inhabitants, animal and vegetable. The certainties of ge-  ology are the physical geography, climate, and, more than all, the  inhabitants, animal and vegetable, of her time-worlds, while her un-  certainties are their relative size and distance. It is seen, then, that  the certainties of the one are precisely the uncertainties of the other.  Which, then, are the nobler â€” the certainties of astronomy or those  of geology ? Is it more noble to know the relative size and position  of worlds in space and time or to be acquainted with the beings  which form their ciowning glory? It would carry me too far to pur-  sue this train of thought. Suffice it to say that, in either case, that  which was most important to know has been rendered most certain ;  while, also, in both cases, that which is most uncertain is also least  important to know.  I have thought this long introduction necessary, because geology is  so constantly misunderstood. She is looked upon by some with sus-  picion, as wild in her speculations and uncertain in her conclusions ;  by others with indifference, as a mass of dry and unattractive detail ;  and by still others with positive dread, as tending to infidelity. I  deemed it necessary, therefore, to say a few words in vindication of  her high rank among the inductive sciences, both in respect to the  certainty of her conclusions, and, still more, the nobleness of her con-  ceptions and the absorbing interest of her subjects. . I miffht havje   124 LECTURES  gone still further, and vindicated her claim to be considered the chief  handmaid of religion among the sciences. But this would have led  me much too far. Thirty years later, and all I have thus far said  would have been unnecessary. One generation more and geology  will need no defender ; both her dignity and her religious tendency  will be universally acknowledged. But for this purpose one more  generation must first pass away.  Perhaps it may seem to some of you as a startling paradox, but it  is nevertheless a fact, that the shortness of human life is one of the  most powerful elements of human progress. It would seem as if the  human mind grows and develops, the philosophy and opinions which  govern the conduct of life continue to be modified and moulded, until  about the age of twenty-five or thirty, when the character becomes  unchangeable, opinions become prejudices, and the whole mind, as it  were, petrified. Further progress would be impossible, but that  another generation, with minds still plastic, comes forward, takes up  and carries on the work a few steps, and becomes petrified in its turn.  There are certainly some noble exceptions to this rule â€” instances of  minds which with their maturity retain the plasticity of youth â€” but  the very rarity of the exception only proves the rule.  You doubtless recollect that tlie children of Israel wandered forty  years in the wilderness before they were fit to enter the promised  land. The marks of Egyptian bondage were upon their souls as well  as upon their necks. One generation must fall in the wilderness, and  a new generation, free from Egyptian prejudices, must arise. We  are apt to look upon this as an isolated fact in history, and entirely  characteristic of this peculiar people. On the contrary, it is a fact  of deepest significance in the philosophy of human progress, and  intended for the instruction of us all. To this day it seems to be im-  possible that any great step should be made in the intellectual progress  of our race, except by the sacrifice of at least one generation. We  are even now in the midst of such a great change, brought about by  the revelations of geology. One more generation dropped in the  wilderness and we are fairly in the promised land. Do not misunder-  stand me, however, as quai rolling with this conservative spirit; on  i\\\\e contrary, this brake upon the wheels of the car of progress seems  absolutely necessary for its steady motion.  But I find I am again digressing, and therefore hasten to return to  my subject.  I have said that the field of geology is the universe of time. It is  one of these time-worlds of which I wish to draw a true, though  necessarily an outline, picture in the next two or three lectures. I  shall not attempt more than an outline, for this would only tire you  with a multitucle of details, but shall seize, if possible, the most strik-  ing features, make a comparison between this and other subsequent  time-worlds, particularly our own, and endeavor to find the law which  binds the whole into one system.  Among the many time-worlds of which geology tells us I select but  one, viz : the Coal Period. Its position is far back in the pah\\3ozoic  times. Measuring time by space it is in the region of the fixed stars,  although one of the brightest in the firmament of time. If I could   ON COAL. 125  transport yon in imagination to the surface of Sirias ; if I could draw  a picture of its physical geography, climate, and, more than all, of its  inhabitants, who in this audience would remain unmoved? Shall  the interest be less because the separation from us is by time instead  of space ; because the place is our own earth, and the materials of the  picture beneath our very feet?  The coal period is a world distinctly separated from those which  precede and those which follow it. As in the geographical distribu-  tion of fauna and flora upon the surface of the earth at the present  time, we find in some cases contiguous fauna and flora seem to inter-  penetrate or pass by insensible gradations into one another ; the  species on the confines of each dying out in number but not in specific  character, insensibly replaced but not ty-ansmuted. So also in the dis-  tribution of fauna and flora in time we find some (as, for instance,  those of the- tertiary) which pass by insensible gradations into one  another, or interlock with the preceding and succeeding, although  only by gradual replacement, not by transmutation. But as in  geographical distribution we also find many fauna and flora com-  pletely isolated by physical barriers, mountain chains, oceans, or  deserts, from contiguous fauna and flora, so also in geological dis-  tribution we find creations are often distinctly separated from other  creations contiguous in time, by physical barriers in the form of con-  vulsions of the earth, and marked by broken, dislocated, and upturned  strata. In the history of the earth there seems to have been many  such successive creations completely destroyed by convulsions ; in  other words, the time-worlds are apparently separated by blank  spaces, whose dimensions we have no means of estimating. Such a  distinct world is the coal period, with its fauna and flora distinctly  separated from the old red sandstone which precedes, and still more  so from the new red sandstone which succeeds. A distinct world â€”  completely circumscribed in time â€” having its own poles and equator.  Now, in geology, history is recorded upon tablets of stone â€” stratified  rocks. Time is represented by their thickness; remarkable events by  their dislocation ; the fauna and flora by the contained fossils. Let  us, then, examine the strata which represent this period.  They are called the \"carboniferous strata,\" and the period the  \" carboniferous period,\" from the remarkable fact that they contain  almost all the coal which is found in the world. The deposit of car-  bonaceous matter is not indeed confined to this period, for it has oc-  curred in every period of the earth's history, as evidenced by the fact  that thin seams of coal are found in all the strata. Similar deposits are  still going on in peat bogs and. deltas of the present day. But the accu-  mulations of carbon in the strata of which we are speaking are so enor-  mous, in comparison to those found elsewhere, that the name carbonife-  rous, as applied to these strata and this period, becomes entirely appro-  priate. With the single exception of the oolite strata, which belong to  the secondary period, and in which coal is profitably mined in Virginia  and in England, all known coal mines belong to the carboniferous  strata. The knowledge of this simple fact would have saved the  useless expenditure of millions of dollars, both in this country and  in England. It is worse than useless to expend money and labor in   126 LECTURES  following up signs of coal, unless we are sure we are in tlie region of  the carboniferous strata.  The carboniferous strata are subdivided into two very distinct groups,  representing, of course, distiuctsubdivisionsof the carboniferous period.  These are called lower and upper carboniferous, or the mountain lime-  stone, and the \"coal measures.\" The former are mostly limestone,  the latter mostly shales and sandstone ; the one mostly of marine  origin, the other mostly fresh water ; the fossils of the one are mostly  marine animals, of the other terrestrial vegetation. I shall confine  myself entirely to the latter, or the true ^^coal measures,\" as they are  called, from the fact that ninety-nine hundredths of all the coal in the  world are found in them.  You will observe, then, that I have taken for my subject one-half  of the carboniferous period. The carboniferous is itself but one of the  four great subdivisions of the palre'zoic period^ and the palfBzoic period,  in its turn, only one of the four great epochs, exclusive of the present,  into which the history of our earth is divided. You see, then, that  the period of which I wish to give you a rapid sketch is less than  one-thirtieth part of the recorded history of the earth ; yet the average  thickness of these strata is about 3,000 or 4,000 feet. In Wales they  are 12,000 feet thick, and in Nova Scotia nearly 15,000. If, then,  thickness of strata represent length of time, how great must be the  lapse of time represented by the coal measures.  Such being the enormous thickness of the coal measures, it neces-  sarily follows that but a very small proportion of the mass consists of  coal. The coal strata consist of thick beds of limestone, sandstone,  ironstone, and shale, containing thin seams of coal, and this alterna-  tion sometimes many times repeated in the same locality ; the whole  forming a series like the sheets of a ream of paper, arranged in no  discoverable rational order, but indiscriminately alternating. The  seam of coal will sometimes be covered with a stratum of limestone,  sometimes of standstone, and sometimes of shale ; although it rarely  happens that the sandstone or limestone comes directly in contact  with the coal ; but is generally separated by a stratum, sometimes  very thin, of shale or slate. In fact a stratum of clay or fine mud  rock both underlies and overlies each seam. Below it forms the \"fire  clay,\" and above the black slate of the miners.  F.ff. 1. J have said that the order is various in different parts of  the same alternating series ; but in every part of the same  coal field the alternation is the same for the same part of  the series. In other words, each stratum is generally  horizontally extended over the whole coal field in a con-  tinuous sheet, so that each seam is accompanied by the  same strata above and below. This is a fact of great  importance, as it affords the readiest means of determining  the identity of individual coal seams.  Coal strata, like all other sedimentary deposits, were at  the time of formation horizontal, or nearly so. Sometimes  they are found nearly in this their original position, as in  many of the coal fields of our own country. More generally this  original horizontality has been disturbed by igneous agency, and the   Sh..   -\"^â€”-^^     Sd...    L. ..  Sh..  S. ..  s. ..    Sh..  Sh ..   â– mr^   L. ..    S. ..

Sometimes the strata are  so folded as to give rise to series of basins belons^ing to tbe same   Pig. 2.   Fi?. 3.    original field. \"Whether, however, the strata retain their original  horizontality, or are thrown into basins by igneous agency, seldom or  never do we find the whole of the original mass deposited. A large  portion has been carried away by aqueous agency. Frrm this cause  a large coal field, covering many thousands of square miles, may exist  only in the form of isolated mountains or detached basins of coal  strata, as in the accompanying figures, where all the mass represented   Fig. 4.   Fig. 5.    FiS. 6.    by tbe dotted lines has been carried away by denuding agencies.  Thus, for instance, nearly the whole of Illinois was originally occupied  by a vast coal field, but little disturbed by igneous agency, but by far  the larger portion of the coal strata of this immense field was carried  away by denuding agencies.  You will observe, then, the striking difierence in mode of occur-  rence between metallic ores and coal. The former are associated with  rocks of every age, except, perhaps, the tertiary ; the latter almost  exclusively confined to those of a particular age. The former exist  in the form of veins intersecting the strata, the latter in the form of  seams parallel with the strata. The former extend indefinitely down-  wards, the latter horizontally. The former are the result of igneous  agency, the latter of sedimentary deposit. Ignorance of this simple  but radical difierence has been the cause of much pecuniary loss, and  seems not yet entirely eradicated. When, for instance, some years ago  it was rumored in the streets of Philadelphia that the bottom of the  Mauch Chunk Summit mine was reached, there was an universal panic,  and stocks in coal mines went down enormously, not knowing that the  continuation of coal seams was to be looked ibr horizontally rather  than vertically.  This simple rule, when taken in connexion with the one previously  enunciated, viz: that a coal seam throughout its whole extent is  attended both above and below by the same strata, would render the  identification of coal seams, and the tracing ot them across valleys  from hillside to hillside, a matter of little difficulty, were it not for   128   LECTURES   dislocation of tlie strata, producing what are called faults, slips, or  troubles. In tlie accompanying figures, for instance, the strata have   Fig. 7.   Fig. 8.    been displaced hj the elevation of one part of the field more than  another. This is not conspicuous on the surface, because all has been  cut down to one level by aqueous agencies. The supposed configura-  tion of surface immediately after such unequal elevation is represented  by the dotted outline ; the strong line represents the present configu-  ration of surface. All between these, therefore, represents the  amount of matter carried away by denuding agencies. These faults  occur very often in coal fields, and are a source of serious annoyance  to the miner.  I have taken here the simplest case of dislocation. The difficulty  becomes very much greater when, instead of being horizontal, the  strata are highly and variously inclined. In such cases the skill and  knov^ledge of the geologist is often tasked to the utmost.  I have said that while metallic veins extend indefinitely downwards,  coal scams for the most part are extended horizontally, or nearly so.  Sometimes, however, coal seams may appear, like metallic veins, to  extend downwards. This is the case in highly inclined and particu-  larly in vertical strata, as in the accompanying sketch of the anthracite  coal field of Pennsylvania. In such cases, however, as well as in   Fig. 9.    every other, it will be observed that the seams are strictly parallel  with the strata, that the strata have been elevated to a vertical posi-  tion by igneous agency, and the included coal seams have been raised  with them, still maintaining their relative position.  The thickness of coal seams varies from a few lines to many feet ;  sometimes they exist as sheets as thin as paper, in others in masses 30  or 40 feet thick. A single seam of pure coal, however, is seldom more  than 6 or 8 feet thick. It is true that in France and in the anthracite  region of Pennsylvania they are said to occur 60 or 70 feet thick, or  even more, but upon close examination such mammoth seams will be  found to consist of two or more seams, separated by thin laminas of  slate ; too thin, however, to form a roof, and, therefore^ the several  seams are wrought together as one.  The number of seams occurring in one locality and separated by  interstratified sandstone and shale is sometimes as great as one  hundred, and their aggregate thickness one hundred and fifty feet.  Enormous as is this mass of carbonaceous matter, it is but a small  fraction of the entire mass of the coal strata. The thickest and purest   ON COAL.   129   seams are generally near the middle of tkis series ; as if tlie conditions  necessary for the formation of coal had gradually come into existence  and as gradually disappeared ; that there were two poles and an  equator belonging to this time-world â€” a morn, noon^ and evening to  this geological day.  We have spoken thus far only of the thickness of coal strata and of  coal seams ; but it is impossible to form a correct idea of the amount  of matter contained in these strata or in these seams without taking  into account also their horizontal extent. Coal is very widely dis-  tributed over the world,, although some countries are more favored  than others. England, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Sweden,  Poland, and Russia have their beds of coal. It is also found abun-  dantly in Asia, Africa, and South America ; but no where is the coal  formation more extensively displayed than in the United States, and  no where are its beds of greater thickness, more convenient for work-  ing, or of more valuable quality. There are within the limits of the  United States no less than four coal fields of enormous dimensions.  One of these, the Appalachian coal field, commences on the north, in  Pennsylvania and Ohio, sweeping south through western Virginia   Ur.S. (jÂ£ A-merica.  CoalArea  103500 S^.Miles    Brit . Amer.

Its  area is estimated at about 60,000 square miles. A second occupies  the greater portion of Illinois and Indiana ; in extent almost equal to  * Recent estimates by Marcou and by H. D.

A third covers the greater portion of Missouri, while  a fourth occupies the greater portion of Michigan Just out ot the  limits of the United States, in New Brunswick and Nova bcotia there  is still a fifth, occupying, according to Mr. Lyell, an area ot 36,000  square miles. Besides these there are several others oi less extent.  If we now compare the relative coal areas of the principal coal pro-  ducing countries, the superiority of our own will he still conspicuous.  The following diagrams represent these relative areas m a more m-  telligihle form than could he done hy mere figures.  But if, on the other hand, we compare in the same manner the  relative annual production of the same countries, we will find the  order very different.   Fig. n.

It is estimated that even at this enormous rate  of production the coal fields of Great Britain will yet last for 500  vears. There is little danger, then, that ours will fail us shortly.  Now industry, as the hasis of the organization of society, forms the  distinguishing feature of modern civilization. Coal is the very aliment  of industry. The material prosperity of any country may therefore  he tolerably accurately estimated by the amount of coal consumed.   ON COAL. 131  According to this method of estimation, Great Britain is superior to  all other countries in actual material civilization. But if the con-  sumption of coal is a measure of the actuau civilization of a country,  the amount of coal area represents its 2yotential civilization. How far  are we superior to all other countries in this respect ! What a glorious  destiny awaits us in the future â€” a destiny already predetermined in  the earliest geological history of the earth.  One more remark and I am done. It is certain that, as manu-  facturing and productive industry take root and flourish almost ex-  clusively in cjol and temperate climates, so also in them do the coal  formations prevail in the greatest abundance. Oar scientific maps  and investigations confirm the one, and national statistics the other.  Almost all the true coal of the world is found in the north temperate  zone. Thus the climates which are most congenial to laborious occu-  pations, the latitudes best adapted to the vigorous growth of industrial  civilization, are precisely those where, fortunately, have been placed  the materials of labor, the aliment of industry. Fortunately did I  say? No; this has not been the result of blind chance, but oi  deliberate providential design. We have here a sublime illustration  of that all-comprehensive foreknowledge which foresees and designs  the end from the beginning ; of that immutability which changes not,  but only unfolds its eternal plans ; of that unity in the system of  time-worlds of which I have already spoken, our own epoch being the  sun and centre.  THEORIES OF THE COAL.  There is no point connected with the coal which has been the  subject of so much discussion as the manner of its accumulation. At  first view, existing nature seems to offer no analogy to guide us in  our attempts to account for such enormous accumulations of carbona-  ceous matter. It is admitted, however, I believe, on all hands, that  the deposit must have taken place in water. The perfect preservation  of the carbon of the plants, and often of their external forms and  structure, which must have suffered complete oxydation and disinte-  gration if exposed to the air, the fact that the plants were most or all  of them swamp plants, and, more than all, the alternation of coal  seams with sedimentary deposits of clay and sand, all seem to point  unmistakably to water as the preserving agent. There is still  another evidence which I think has generally been overlooked. In  the midst of the more structureless bituminous matter of the coal are  often found imbedded wedge-shaped masses of vascular tissue called  native carbon. No one who attentively examines these wedges can  fail to perceive that they are the wooden wedges of exogens separated  by the decomposition of the softer cellular tissue of the intervening  medullary rays, while they floated as logs upon the water and finally  became imbedded in the carbonaceous mud below.  Thus far I believe all theorists agree. But from this point opinions  diverge ; some geologists holding that the coal was deposited on the  spot where the plants grew, others that the plants were drifted in the   132 LE-DTUEES  form of rafts to great distances and deposited at the mouths of rivers ;  the former, that a coal basin is the site of an ancient peat bog, thÂ©  latter, that it is the position of an ancient estuary or delta. The  former opinion is called the ^^ peat hog theory,\" the latter the  \" estuoA'y theory.\"  Peat hog theory. â€” It is well known that in many countries, par-  ticularly in moist, cool climates, and damp, low grounds, certain  plants, such as ferns, mosses, &c., as well as trees which delight in  moist places, if allowed to grow undisturbed from generation to  generation will, by their decay, accumulate enormous masses of car-  bonaceous matter. Such a spot is called a peat hog. The theory of  this accumulation is as follows : Plants derive all their carbon from  the atmosphere. In the annual fall of leaf, and finally their own  death, they return to the earth the whole of the matter thus silently  extracted irom the air. Undisturbed vegetation, therefore, constantly  enriches the soil by adding to it what has been taken from the air.  Thus worn out lands improve by lying fallow. Thus the rich black  vegetable mould found covering the ground in forests continues to  increase from year to year. In all ordinary cases, however, there is  a limit beyond which this accumulation will not go. By decom-  position the organic matter is again returned to the atmosphere as  : fast as it accumulates. But if by any means this decomposition is  <:prevented the organic matter accumulates indefinitely. This is  precisely what takes place in peat bogs. The presence of water  in a great measure prevents the oxydation of the carbon. The  growth of plants now continually takes carbon from the atmosphere,  their death as continually deposits it upon the earth. Each genera-  -tion rises, phoenix-like, from the ashes of the last, to become in its  turn soil for the next. Thus the ancestral accumulation continues  to increase, the funeral pile continues to rise, until pure carbonaceous  matter may in time accumulate to the depth of thirty or forty feet.  . Such a mass of carbonaceous matter deprived of its water and com-  pressed to the density of coal, would make a seam of perhaps three  â–  or four feet in thickness. Now, according to the peat bog theory, it  is under such circumstances that the carbon of a coal seam has been  ; accumulated.  The arguments in favor of this theory are : 1st. The purity of the  . coal. It is true that coal is often found largely mixed with earthy  matter or mud. As we have already shown, every stage of gradation  i may be traced between pure coal and pure shale. But by far the  larger portion of coal seems to be entirely free from foreign matter.  ' The amount of ash is not greater than five to ten per cent. ; that is,  not greater than might arise from the earthy matter of the plants  Irom which the coal was derived. This purity of the coal indicates  complete absence of sediment in the water in which the coal was  originally laid down. Now the water of peat swamps, though dis-  . colored by organic matter in solution, is always entirely free from  sediment. In fact, this seems a necessary condition of the growth of  peat plants â€” an incursion of water containing mud is fatal to such  plants. If, then, a coal seam is the result of carbonaceous matter   ON COAL. 133  slowly accumulated at the bottom of ancient peat swamps, tlie purity  of the coal is completely accounted for. But if, on the contrary, it is  formed by the accumulation of timber carried down to the mouths of  great rivers during freshets, it should always be largely mised with  mud.  2d. The fine preservation of the tenderest and most delicate parts  of plants. We have already spoken of the profusion of finely-  preserved leaves and entire fronds of ferns in the black slate overlying  a coal seam. So perfect is this preservation that large and complex  fronds are often entirely unbroken, and even the minutest variation  of the leaves as distinct as in the living fern. This fine preservation  of tender parts seems strongly to indicate that these leaves had fallen  gently from the parent stem, and been preserved on the spot where  they fell. It seems utterly inconsistent with the violent action of  currents bearing rafts to great distances.  3d. The position of the finely-preserved leaves, &c., always on the  opper surface of the coal seam, (roof of the coal mine.) Precisely  the same is observed in every peat swamp. The perfect leaves are to  be found only on top, for the plain reason that these are the last  fallen, and therefore not yet disorganized. But in the case of accu-  mulations of vegetable matter at the mouths of rivers, there seems to  be no reason why leaves should not be entangled in all parts alike.  4th. Coal, like peat, is composed of completely disorganized carbo-  naceous matter, containing fragments in which vegetable structure is  more distinct. This is not inconsistent with what I have already  said in my last lecture of the vegetable origin of even the most  structureless coal being detectable by the microscope. Plants are  composed entirely of cells. Both in peat and in coal these cells are  generally separated from one another. The vegetable structure is  completely disorganized, but the separate cells still bear unmistakable  marks of their origin ; the organic structure is gone, but the organic  origin is still visible. But if a coal seam was an imbedded raft, it  should be composed almost entirely of fragments of trunks, branches,  &c., instead of a structureless mass containing only a few such  fragments.  5th. It will be recollected that a seam of coal is overlaid by black  slate and underlaid by fire-clay. In the black slate, as already said,  are found the finest impressions of leaves and other tender parts ; in  the Jire-day, which underlies the coal seam, are found imbedded in  the greatest abundance the roots of plants, and not unfrequently the  stumps of trees with the roots attached, precisely as they grow. And,  what is still more remarkable and significant, trunks of trees are not  unfrequently found almost entire, standing erect, with their roots still  bedded in the fire-clay, their trunks passing through the seam, and  far into the overlying strata of shale and limestone. By means of  evidence of this kind Lyell and Dawson have been able to make out  distinctly nearly 60 planes of successive vegetation in the coal field of  Nova Scotia. In many of these, viz: about 20, the trees are slill in  the position in which they grew, as shown in figure 12 ; of the rest  the evidence consisted in the imbedded stigmaria or roots of sigil-  laria.   134   LECTUEES    Fig. 12. In tlie cases in which these  trunks and roots, in situ, are  found, (and they are by no  means uncommon,) the evidence  is conclusive that the coal was  formed on the spot where the  trees grew; in other words, that  the growth of the trees and the  deposit of the coal took place  simultaneously on the same spot.  This is clearly impossible in an  estuary, but is known to take  place in every peat swamp.  To recapitulate the whole argument : If we examine a peat bog  which has been for many years thickly overgrown with ferns, mosses,  and water plants of various kinds, and shaded by many large trees,  we find the soil composed entirely of black carbonaceous matter,  wholly destitute of structure but revealing its vegetable origin to the  microscope, containing fragments of trunks and branches of trees  lying in all possible positions, some prostrate, some inclined at all  angles, many, both living and dead, still erect, their roots firmly fixed  in the clay at the bottom of the bog, below the peaty matter which  has slowly gathered about their lower parts, and over the whole lie  thickly strewn the freshly fallen leaves. Now suppose such a peat  bog to be deeply buried beneath the surface of water and overwhelmed  with sediment of clay and sand, and again, after ages, elevated and  exposed by section to the scrutiny of the geologist, and we shall have  a complete reproduction of the phenomena of a coal seam.  The great, and almost the only, objection which has been urged against  this theory is to be found, not in the phenomena of an individual coal  seam, but rather in the general phenomena of coal basins, in the re-  peated alternation in the same locality of coal seams with marine and  fresh water strata. We have already seen that there are in the same  coal basin sometimes as many as an hundred coal seams, one above the  other ; now, according to this theory, when the coal seam was forming  the spot must have been above the surface of the sea, but when the inter-  stratified limestones and shales were being deposited the same spot  must have been beneath the sea-level. Thus^ argues the objector, we  are driven to the enormous assumption that the same spot has been  successively upheaved above and depressed beneath the sea-level one  hundred times during the carboniferous period, and, what is still  more remarkable, that every time it rose above the sea it became a  peat swamp ; or if the intervening strata are fresh water instead of  marine, the difficulty seems only to be increased.  Estuary theory. â€” It is to meet this very difficulty, to account  for this remarkable alternation of strata, that the rival theory has  been proposed. An estuary is the wide open mouth of a river empty-  ing into a tidal sea ; it is occupied sometimes by fresh and sometimes  by salt water. The deposit at the bottom of an estuary, in suitable  positions, is, therefore, an alternation of fresh water and marine strata.  In seasons of freshets the river water^ loaded with sediment and   ON COAL. â€¢ 135  perhaps bearing rafts of drift titaber, forces back the sea water, occu-  pies the estuary, and makes its deposit of clay and sand, containing  fragments of such drift timber; in seasons of low water the ocean  returns and makes its deposit^ perhaps of limestone, and so on alter-  nately. A coal field is supposed by these theorists to be the position  of an ancient estuary ; the limestone strata are the marine deposit,  the shale and sandstone the river deposit, and the coal seam the  imbedded drift timber brought down by the river from distant forests.  The objections to this theory are all that has been said in favor of  the peat bog theory. The pureness of the coal, the fine preservation  of even the tenderest parts of plants, the position of such well pre-  served specimens always on the upper surface of a coal seam, the  structureless character of the great mass of the coal, and, above all,  stumps and trunks of trees still erect, with their roots still fixed in  the clay stratum below â€” all this seems not only unaccountable but  impossible on this theory.  In comparing these two theories it will be seen that the first ex-  plains completely the phenomena of an individual coal seam, but  signally fails to explain the general phenomena of a coal basin, viz :  the alternation of coal seam with marine and fresh water strata ; while,  on the other hand, the second explains well this alternation, but fails  utterly to explain the phenomena of an individual coal seam. There  is, then, real and substantial evidence in favor of each, and equally  substantial objections. If this had not been the case one or the other  would have been relinquished ere this. But we find, on the contrary,  that they have both found strenuous advocates from the time geology  commenced to exist as a science until now. In every such case of  vitality in rival theories it will be found, I think, that there is a real  germ of truth in both â€” that both are true and both are false ; both  true in some sense, and therefore reconcilable ; and both false through  narrowness of view, through exclusiveness, through mistaking a par-  tial for a general view. I can best illustrate my meaning by referring  you to the familiar but very instructive fable of the shield, which  being distinctly seen by two knights of equally good eye sight and of  undoubted veracity, was declared by one to be white and by the other  to be black. You will recollect that, after several lances were broken  and many wounds and bruises endured to decide the knotty point, it  was discovered by some one who, strange to say, was more interested  in the truth than in the dispute, that one side ivas ivhite and the other  was black. The disputants were both right and both wrong, but  wrong only by exclusiveness, by mistaking a partial for a general  view. So it is with almost all vexed questions. There is truth on  both sides, but both err in excluding the other. We are seeking in  the right direction when we attempt to show the partialness of both  views. We have risen to a higher view, to a philosophic truth, when  we show that these two partial and apparently irreconcilable views  may be united into one ; these two surface views may be stereoscopi-  cally combined.  There is an old and much quoted adage, that \" truth lies in the mid-  dle\" between extreme opinions. As generally understood nothing   136 * LECTURES  can be more false or hurtful. Through its influence a merely timid  or temporizing policy is mistaken for wisdom, the \"fence man\" is  mistaken for the philosopher. There is another old adage, that  'â– ^extremes meet;\" i. e., what to the superficial observer seem to be  extremes, to the deeper thinker are often really closely allied. But  the converse of this proposition, though not erected into an adage, is  even more profoundly true, viz : that what seem to be closely allied  are very often real extremes. There is often a superficial resemblance  between the highest and the lowest, so that by the unthinking multi-  tude the one is often mistaken for the other ; pride for nobility of soul,  humility for mean-spiritedness, the serenity of self-command for the  serenity of insensibility, &c. It is only in this way that the \" fence  man\" resembles the philosopher_, for they are as wide apart as the  poles. It is in tliis way only that truth seems to \" lie in the middle,\"  although we are further from it there than anywhere else. To refer  again to the fable of the shield : It would have been a poor solution  of the famous dispute to say that the shield was neither pure white  nor pure black, but midway between the two extremes ; that it was,  in fact, some shade of gray or dusky, or, perhaps, pepper and salt.  No; I repeat, truth lies not \"in the middle,\" but the reconciliation of  extremes in the harmonious combination of apparent antagonisms.  Now, it seems to me that the phenomena of a coal seam already  enumerated prove most conclusively that the coal was formed in situ,  as in the peat swamps of the present day. At the same time the fre-  quent alternation of seams with marine and fresh water strata prove  also most conclusively that the deposit took place at the raouths of  rivers. Here are two incontestible facts. We must put them to-  gether ; we must combine them if we would make a true and sufficient  theory. I believe the more this subject is reflected on the more we  shall be convinced that coal was deposited in peat swamps at the mouths  of large rivers, and therefore subject to overflows by the river and  occasional inundations by the sea. We are to look for analogies in  existing nature, not among the bogs of Ireland, but among the river  swamps of the Mississippi.  It is well known that such peat swamps, some of them of enormous  extent, exist now on the margins and in the delta of the Mississippi  and probably many other large rivers, and that pure peat unmixed  with mud is constantly forming in these swamps^, although they are  annually flooded by the river. This seems at first incredible, when  we recollect that the river water is Iciaded with sediment, and that  sediment prevents the growth of peat plants, or at least would entirely  destroy the purity of the peat. . But this apparent anomaly has been  entirely explained by Mr. Lyell. According to this high authority,  although the peat swamps of the Mississippi are annually flooded by  river water they are entirely untouched by river mud. These favored  spots are surrounded, particularly on the side next the river, by dense  vegetation, which, acting as a sieve, completely strains the water of  its mud before it reaches the peat swamp. The water of these swamps  is therefore pure, and pure peat has been quietly depositing there for  ages.   ON COAL.   137    Let us now suppose that  there existed during the  carboniferous period a large  river, perhaps less than the  Mississippi, but with enor-  mous swamps and delta,  overgrown with rank vege-  tation far surpassing in  luxuriance anything we  know at the present day.  In the midst of such swamps  there would evidently occur  spots of great extent, the  waters of which, for the  reasons already mentioned, would never be contaminated with sedi-  ment, as at (a) fig. 13. Here for untold ages pure carbonaceous matter  would accumulate undisturbed. In the course of time the surround-  ing portions of the swamps (b) where the mud is detained would rise  by deposit of sediment, while the peat swamp (a) would remain as a  sunken country, such as exist now in the swamps of the Mississippi.  Finally, at uncertain intervals, a more than usually large freshet, or  perhaps some change in the level of the land, would deluge the swamp  with mud and bury the peat. Gradually the vegetation would re-  turn, and the former condition of things be restored, to pass again  through the same changes. We have but one other supposition to  make, viz : that the whole river swamp and delta were gradually sub-  siding during the whole carboniferous period. This is by no means  a violent supposition, but one which we have a right in this case to  make for two good reasons : 1st. We have the best evidence that  many of the large deltas of the present day are thus subsiding. This  is proved in the case of the Mississippi delta by cypress stumps in situ  below the level of the sea. 2d. The coal strata themselves give indu-  bitable evidence of gradual subsidence during the period of their de-  posit. The character of these strata and their fossils shows that they  were deposited in shallow water, but their enormous thickness (nearly  three miles in Nova Scotia) renders this clearly impossible^ unless we  suppose such subsidence ; for, if the bottom was stationary, it must  have been three miles below the surface of the water when the lowest  stratum was deposited. Now, if such subsidence went on constantly,  but slowly, so that, under ordinary circumstances, the delta could be  maintained by deposit from the river^ but at uncertain intervals, more  rapidly than the river could build up, so that the sea would again  usurp possession and make its deposit of limestone, and again more  slowly^ so that the area might again be reclaimed by the river, and  become a peat swamp, and so on alternately, we should easily, with-  out any violent hypothesis, account for all the phenomena of a coal  basin.  It will be observed that by this hypothesis the area of a coal basin  has, indeed, been successively above and below the sea-surface, but  not by successive upheaval and depression, as it has been supposed  necessary on the peat bog theory, but by the contention, with various   138 LECTURES  success, of opposing forces, aqueous and igneous, the river constantly-  building up, and igneous forces beneath as constantly striving to de-  press ; sometimes one force predominating, sometimes the other. Of  such contention we have many instances in existing nature. It is  evidently going on in the delta of the Mississippi at the present time.  It may not be possible, in the present condition of science, to picture  to ourselves all the circumstances connected with this process. Per-  haps I have already gone too far in this attempt ; but the general  facts upon which the theory rest are incontestible. Coal has almost  certainly accumulated m situ in extensive peat swamps at the mouths  of large rivers, upon ground which was slowly subsiding during the  whole period. Under these circumstances it seems not difficult to  account for all the phenomena of a coal basin. All we have to do in  future is by study of the peat swamp of the Mississippi and the phe-  nomena of delta deposit to discover the details of the process, to fill  up the outline of the picture.  There is a fact noticed by Mr. Lyell, which is strongly confirmatory  of this theory. In the sandstone of the coal measures it is common  to find trunks of trees, but only trunks â€” no small branches, leaves, or  tender jjarts. Moreover these trunks are observed to be mostly pines,  highland trees, while the trunks in the coal seam proper are sigilla-  ria, lepidodendron, calamites â€” swamp trees. Now, when we recollect  that coarse sandstone is the deposit of rapid current, does it not seem  evident that the sandstone was deposited by the freshet which over-  whelmed the peat swamp, and that the pine trunks are the remains  of drift timber brought from the highlands. Here, then, we have  ancient drift timber, but how different from a coal seam !  Let us now attempt to estimate approximatively the time necessary  to bring about these stupendous results. I believe we should never  neglect an opportunity of this kind, because the popular mind has not  yet grasped the idea of illimitable time required by geology to the  same extent as it has the idea of illimitable space required by  astronomy; and, as I believe, this is one of the greatest difficulties  with which geology has to contend.  According to Boussingault luxuriant vegetation at the present day  takes from the atmosphere about a half ton of carbon per acre annu-  ally, or 50 tons per acre in a century. Fifty tons of carbon of the  specific gravity of coal, about 1.50, spread evenly over the surface of  an acre, would make a layer of less than \\ of an inch. Humboldt  makes the estimate a little higher, viz : \\ an inch. We are willing  to take the higher estimate. It appears, then, that if all the carbon  taken from the air was preserved in the form of coal, our most luxu-  riant vegetation would make but a \\ inch of coal in a century. But  in the coal measures the aggregate thickness of the coal seams in the  same basin is sometimes 150 feet or more. In 150 feet there are  1,800 inches, or 3,600 half inches. At the present rate of vegetation,  then, it would take 3,600 centuries, or 360,000 years^ to accumulate  this amount. But it will be objected that the vegetation of the coal  period was probably m jch more luxuriant than the present, and the  tendency of this difference would be to shorten the time. True ; but  it will be recollected that this estimate was made upon the ground   ON COAL. 139  that all the carbon was preserved. This is in the highest degree im-  probable, not to say impossible. Probably much more than half was  returned to atmosphere in the form of carbonic acid and carburetted  hydrogen. Again, we have taken no account of the enormous periods  of time during which there was no carbon deposited on the spot in  question, and represented by the intervening strata of limestone,  sandstone, and shale. The estimate we have given above, therefore,  probably falls very far short of the truth. Let us try another.  According to Messrs. Lyell and Dawson the coal strata of Nova  Scotia are about three miles in thickness at the South Joggins. At  another point, nearly 100 miles distant, (Albion mines,) they found  the thickness nearly the same. There is little danger, therefore, of  erring on the side of excess, if we take the average thickness of the  strata over the whole basin at one and a half miles. Now, the area  of this coal field, according to Mr. Lyell, is about 3,600 square miles.  This would give, as the solid contents of these strata, 54,000 cubic  miles. But we have already seen that this enormous amount of mat-  ter was almost certainly accumulated at the mouth of a great river.  Let us see how long it would take one of our great rivers to do the  work. I shall select for this purpose the Mississippi and the Ganges,  because they are both very large rivers, carrying vast amounts of  sediment, and because accurate observations have been made as to the  amount of sediment brought down by them. These observations have  been made upon the Mississippi by Drs. Forshay and Reddell, of New  Orleans, and by Captain Strachey, British engineer, upon the Ganges.  According to these observations it would take the Mississippi 2,000,000  years, and the Ganges* 3*75,000 years to perform the work. And yet  the period we are now discussing is probably not one-thirtieth, cer-  tainly but a small portion of the entire geological history of the earth.  It will no doubt be objected to this estimate that it is founded upon  a particular theory, and this theory may be incorrect, and the estimate  thus falls to the ground. In answer to this objection it is only neces-  sary to state that we are acquainted with no other circumstances under  which strata accumulate so rapidly as at the mouths of rivers. Any  other conceivable theory, therefore, would only increase the time.  Again, it will probably be objected that the agencies of nature may  have been and probably were more active in earlier periods of the his-  tory of the earth than now. Such a notion, although almost universal  among intelligent people and very prevalent even among geologists,  is, as it seems to me, utterly without foundation in reason. In refer-  ence to this point geologists may be divided into two classes. The  first and most numei'ous class hold that the agencies of nature have  gradually decreased in activity from the earliest times until now. The  other, to which Mr. Lyell and his followers belong, believes that these  agencies have acted much as they do now through all time ; that there  has been no progressive change of any kind, neither in the earth nor  its inhabitants. Now, it seems to me that it can be proved, or at  * This amaziiiff difference in favor of a smaller river is due to the fact that the Ganges,  being- a tropical river, the rains all i'all during six months, and are therefore very heavy. The  washing of the soil and resulting sediment are necessarily in proportion. The mountainous  country in which the Ganges takes its rise contributes also to the same result.   140 LECTURES  least rendered extremely probable, that neither of these theorists is  in the right ; that, in fact, while the igneous agencies have been de-  creasing in activity, the aqueous have been constantly increasing in  the same proportion. As I believe I differ from all other geologists in  my views on this pointy I deem it important to go a little more fully  into this subject.  It is generally admitted by geologists, and indeed there is good and  substantial evidence of the fact, that the earth has been gradually cool-  ing throughout all geological history from an original very high tem-  perature. We have also, as I believe most geologists will admit, good  and substantial evidence that the land has constantly increased both  in extent and in elevation with the course of time, while the ocean has  as constantly decreased in extent in the same proportion. In other  words, these two elements, land and water, have been, as it were,  gradually differentiated. Admit these two points and all the rest  logically follow.  The activity of igneous agencies depends upon the internal temper-  ature of the earth. As this has constantly decreased the igneous  agencies have also decreased in energy in the same proportion. The  aqueous agencies, on the other hand, are the result of currents of air  and water upon the surface of the earth ; and the rapidity of these  currents depends, not upon the mean surface temperature, but upon  the difference of temperature in different parts of the surface ; *. e. ,  between pole and equator or between land and water. It only remains  to prove, then, that this difference of temperature has been constantly  increasing with the course of time.  Land, as is well known, is both a better absorber and a better radi-  ator of heat than water ; i. e. , will both heat faster and cool faster  under given circumstances than water. A globe of land would be both  hotter at the equator and colder at the poles than a globe covered with  water and exposed to the same influences. Although the mean tem-  perature would be nearly the same in the two cases, the difference of  temperature would be much greater in the former than in the latter.  It follows, therefore, that as the extent of land increased and that of  the ocean decreased with the course of time the difference of tempera-  ture between pole and equator must have increased in the same proportion.  The gradual decrease of the mean temperature would evidently contri-  bute to the same result; for it is evident that with a higher mean temper-  ature a larger portion of water would exist in the form of vapor. This  excessive vapor would rise into the atmosphere and become condensed  into universal clouds, mist or fogs, but seldom, and to a very limited ex-  tent, in the earlier periods of the earth's history, into rat'w, because, as  yet, there were neither extensive high land nor cool currents sufficient  for extensive precipitation. Thus would result a thick, murky atmo-  sphere, enveloping the whole earth. The necessary effect of this would  be still further to prevent absorption of heat at the equator and radiation  at the poles, and thus to produce still greater uniformity of climate.  In the earliest geological periods, therefore, when the surface temper-  ature^ iv ova internal causes, v/as very great, and the ocean almost uni-  versal, the difference of temperature between pole and equator was  reduced to a minimum. In such a condition of things it is evident   ON COAL. 141  that tlie exchange between pole and equator currents of the aqueous  and aerial ocean must have been not only very sluggish hut perfectly  regular northeast and southwest currents in the northern hemi-  sphere, and northwest and southeast currents in the southern. In  proportion as the earth cooled the diversity of temperature between  pole and equator became greater and the exchange more rapid. In  the meantime the gradual increase in the extent and elevation of con-  tinents would introduce still greater diversity. The regular oceanic  currents, by impinging upon the continents, are reflected in various  directions, increasing still further the diversity of climate. Currents  of the air^ too, are no longer only trade winds, but also monsoons, land  and sea breezes, &c. These various currents, mingling and contend-  ing, produce the infinitely varying winds of the present epoch. But  the most important current we have not yet spoken of. Land and sea  may be considered the two poles of a circulating apparatus ; water  rises in the form of vapor at one pole, passes over through the atmo-  sphere, and is condensed on the other in the form of rain, and so back  by the rivers to the ocean. The more rapid the condensation the more  rapid the evaporation and the more rapid the circulation. Within  certain limits, (i. e., until the land is sufficient to condense all the water  evaporated from the ocean,) the amount of evaporation and condensa-  tion is in proportion to the extent and elevation of the continents.  It is evident, then, that in the earlier periods of the earth's history,  when the ocean was almost universal, although the air was saturated  with moisture, there was comparatively litfle rain ; and that just in  proportion as the continents increased in extent and elevation, evapor-  ation, and condensation would increase in the same proportion. It is  impossible to resist the conclusion, then, that from the earliest jjeriods  until now there has been a constant increase in activity and variety of  currents of ocean and atmosphere ; of wind and rain ; of cloud and  sunshine ; of fountains and rivers ; in fact of all that constitutes the  life, variety, and beauty of our beloved earth.  Thus it appears that at first igneous predominated over aqueous agen-  cies. It was this very predominance which caused uncompensated, pro-  gressive change â€” development of the earth as a whole ; for perfect  balance is incompatible with developement. But gradually aqueous  agencies increased in energy ; the antagonistic forces approached a  balance as the earth approached maturity, until at present the balance  may possibly be complete.  In all I have said I have had in view, of course, only the ordinary  regular operation of aqueous agencies, or what Mr. Lyell calls \" causes  now in operation.\" I say of course, because the extraordinary, irregu-  lar operation of these agencies, such as are called ^^ debacles,\" &c., are  too uncertain and hypothetical, not to say improbable, to form the  basis of any reasoning whatever. I repeat, then, that during the coal  period the ordinary operation of aqueous or degrading agencies must  have been more slow than at present. The accumulation of a certain  amount of material in a river delta, other things being equal, would  require a longer time than now.   142 LECTURES   CLIMATE OF THE COAL PERIOD.  It is probable, from what evidence we have on this subject, that  the climate of the coal period was characterized by greater warmth,  greater humidity, and greater uniformity than now obtains, and that  the air was more highly charged with carbonic acid. Of the greater  warmth of the climate we have evidence in the astonishing luxuriance  and universal tropical character of the vegetation of the period. One  of the most marked peculiarities of the flora of coal everywhere is the  great relative abundance of ferns and fern allies. In the present flora  of Great Britain the ratio of ferns to flowering plants is about 1 to 35,  while in the coal flora of the same country nearly one-half of all the  known plants are ferns. In the American coal flora the ])roportion  of ferns is said to be still greater. That this abundance of ferns indi-  cales a tropical climate is shown by the fact that in the existing flora,  out of about 1,500 known species of ferns, 1,200 are confined to the  tropics^ and as we pass from the equator towards the poles the propor-  tion of ferns, steadily diminishes. The same may be said with refer-  ence to the club-mosses. It is worthy of remark, too, that although  conifers are abundant now all over the earth's surface, still those most  nearly allied to the conifers of the coal â€” such, for instance, as the  araucaria and salisburia of the present day â€” are found only in tropical  regions. Now, during the coal period, this tropical vegetation extended  as far as 75Â° north latitude. Tree ferns and gigantic club-mosses  covered the spot now occupied by the Mellville island. The evidence  of remarkable humidity is no less satisfactory, for it is only in warm,  7noist climates that ferns and club-mosses grow in the greatest abun-  dance and luxuriance. On some islands in the tropics and in the  south seas the abundance of ferns even approaches that of the coal  flora. In fact, as a condition of the growth of these plants, moisture  seems even more necessary than heat.  It has been objected to the greater heat of the climate, that coal was  evidently formed by accumulation of carbonaceous matter in situ as  now in peat bogs, and that peat bogs are found only in cool climates.  The answer to this objection is not diflicult. It is not the heat  immediately, but the resulting capacity for moisture, or, in common  language, dryness of the air of the tropics, which under ordinary cir-  cumstances prevents the preservation of carbon. The air is not so  constantly at or near the point of saturation. Fogs, and mists, and  clouds are not so constant as in cooler climates. But we have sup-  posed greater humidity as well as heat during the coal period. Under  these circumstances, there is no reason why peat should not accumu-  late. We see proof of this in the peat swamps at the mouth of the  Mississippi. Here we find peat accumulating in great abundance in  a climate which is yet very warm ; and we have already seen that it  is in such peat swamps, rather than in the bogs of cooler climates,  that we are to look for analogies with the peaty accumulations of the  coal period. The enormous extent of these peat swamps becomes in its  turn an additional ])roof of the great humidity of the climate.  The uniformity of climate â€” i. e. the comparatively equable distri-   ON COAL. 143  bution of lieat and moisture on the surface of the earth durins: the  coal period â€” is evidenced by the remarkable uniformity of the flora.  The general character of the coal flora was very much the same in every  portion of the earth's surface, and in many cases even the same species  are found in the most distant countries. Thus many identical species  have been found in Europe, United States, New Holland and Mell-  ville island, countries the existing flora of which differ entirely. Now,  although I cannot accede to the doctrine that diversity of climate is  the physical cause of diversity of fauna and flora, yet, whether we con-  sider the physical or the flnal cause, the result would evidently be the  same, viz : the perfect harmony between the climate and the fauna  and flora, the perfect adaptation of the one to the other.  That the atmosphere was highly charged with carbonic acid is ren-  dered probable by the astonishing luxuriance of the vegetation of the  period. Some experiments recently made by Mr. Gladstone seem to show  that up to a certain limit the growth of ferns is rendered more rapid by  the addition of carbonic acid to the atmosphere in which they grow.  This probably becomes a certainty, when we reflect upon the enormous  amount of carbon contained in the coal deposits, all of which must  have been extracted from the atmosphere. It has been estimated that  \" all the forests of the United States gathered into one heap would  fail to furnish materials of a single coal seam equal to that of Pitts-  burg.\" Again, that \" that there is laid up in the earth, in the form  of coal, six times as much carbon as now exists in the atmosphere. If  it was all returned to the air, there would be seven times as much  carbonic acid in the atmosphere as at present.\"  Cause of the climate of the coal. â€” Much speculative ingenuity has  been exhausted to little effect in attempts to account for the remark-  able climate of this period. We find here the same looseness of rea-  soning unfortunately so common among geologists when dealing with  physical subjects. The subject of most of this speculation has been  the cause of the supposed greater heat of the climate. There are two  principal methods of accounting for it. The first and most obvious  mode is by means ot the commonly received hypothesis that the earth  has cooled down to its present temperature from an original state of  incandescence. But although there is much independent evidence of  this original condition â€” and we think it extremely probable, therefore,  that the heat of the coal period was due, at least in part, to this cause â€”  yet, as Hopkins has shown, (Geol. Jour., 1853,) there are strong ob-  jections to this as the only cause. We have already said that the  surface temperature of the earth is due partly to internal and partly to  external causes. At present the surface temperature from internal  causes has become almost nothing, i. e. only one-twentieth of a degree  Fahrenheit. The increase of temperature below the surface is about  1Â° to sixty feet. Now, if we supposed the surface temperature from  this cause to be increased even to 1Â°, the increase for every sixty feet  of depth would be 20Â°. An increase of 10Â° surface temperature would  make 200Â° increase of temperature for every sixty feet. The springs,  except the most superficial, would all be boiling. Now, it will be  recollected that the winter temperature of Mellville, where coal is  found abundantly, is â€”20Â° Fahrenheit. It would, therefore, take near   144 LECTURES  100Â° additional of surface temperature to raise this to tropical heat.  This would necessitate a temperature of 2,000Â° at the depth of sixty-  feet, a condition of things, it would seem, utterly incompatible with  the existence of luxuriant vegetation on the surface.  The second mode of accounting for it is by means of distribution of  land and water uj3on the earth's surface. Land, as compared with  water, is both a better absorber and better radiator of heat, i. e., will  both heat faster under the influence of a source of heat, as the sun,  and cool faster when that source is withdrawn. This is familiarly  illustrated by land and sea breezes. Again : the earth at the equator  receives more heat from the sun than it radiates, while at the poles,  on the contrary, it radiates more than it receives from the sun, the  overplus in both cases being balanced by the currents of ocean and  atmosphere. If these currents could be prevented, the equator, for a  time, would get progressively warmer, and the jooles progressively  colder. We may evidently, then, look upon the earth as a body heat-  ing at the equator and cooling at the poles. Now, when we recollect  the great absorbing and radiating power of land, as compared with  water, it is easy to see that the mean temperature of the earth's surface  may be materially affected by the distribution of these elements with  reference to the two points in question. For instance, if the water be  all collected in a belt about the equator, and the poles be occupied  entirely by land, we would have the conditions most unfavorable for  heating at the equator and most favorable for cooling at the poles.  The result would be a considerable lowering of the mean temperature.  If, on the contrary _, the waters be gathered into polar oceans, leaving  an equatorial belt of land, the conditions would be most favorable for  heating at the equator and most unfavorable for cooling at the poles,  and the mean temperature would consequently rise. It is estimated  that these two extreme conditions would bring down the mean tem-  perature to 32Â°, or raise it to tropical heat. It is not to be supposed  that such extreme conditions ever existed ; but any approximation to  such conditions â€” for instance, a decided predominance of land towards  the equator or poles â€” would produce the same effects to a corresponding  degree. Now, it is possible that the greater heat of the coal period  may be due to some such distribution of land and water.  The fatal objection to this explanation is that we find no coal in  tropical regions. As every coal field presupposes a large river, and  therefore a considerable extent of land, the distribution of coal may  be looked upon as in a general way indicative of the distribution of  land during the period. It would seem from this that the larger  bodies of land existed in temperate and arctic rather than in tropical  regions.  But if it is impossible by distribution of land and water to account  for the greater mean temperature, it is at least easy in this way to  account for the greater liumidity and uniformity of climate which we  have found equally to characterize this period. I have already alluded  to the fact that the pala?ozoic seas were probably very wide and the  land correspondingly small in extent and low, and that such a condi-  tion of things, on account of the very limited condensation and pre-  cipitation of vapor^ would produce a very humid climate. Now, water   ON COAL. 145  being both a bad absorber and bad radiator of heat^ botb heating very  slowly and cooling very slowly, it is evident that a great predominance  of that element would produce, also, a very uniform climate. The  difference of temperature between pole and equator, and between winter  and summer, would be less than at present.  Some geologists think, with Mr. Lyell, that this uniformity and  humidity of climate is sufficient to account for the coal vegetation  without the necessity of a higher mean temperature than now exists.  If the present mean temperature was distributed more equably both  over the earth surface and over the year, the effect would be to pro-  duce cooler equator, it is true, but also much warmer high latitudes,  and particularly the winters of high latitudes would be much less  severe. The evidence is, however, it seems to me, in favor of some  elevation of the mean temperature also. It is difficult to conceive how  any uniformity of distribution of the present mean temperature, such  as would be produced by the predominance of water, could raise the  winter temperature of Mellville island to the point necessa,ry for the  luxuriant growth of tree ferns. Some increase of temperature from  internal cause seems to be necessary. I suppose, therefore, that if the  temperature of the earth from internal causes was slightly elevated,  say 10Â°, so that the mean temperature from 60Â° should become 70Â°,  and then this mean temperature distributed over the earth surface as  uniformly as possible, by means of a wide extent of ocean, we should  have all the conditions necessary to produce the phenomena of coal  vegetation. It will be recollected, too, that we have much indepen-  dent evidence of the cooling of the earth from an original very high  temperature.  With reference to the highly carbonated condition of the atmo-  sphere, we may suppose this to be the result of the greater activity  of carbonic acid producing causes, or else we may refer it to the  original constitution of the air â€” the natural process by which car-  bonic acid is given to the air, decomposition, combustion, respiration  of animals, and volcanoes, carbonated springs, &c. It will be admitted  by all that the first three may be neglected, since they return to the  air only what had been previously taken from it. The carbonic acid  supplied to the air by volcanoes and carbonated springs, according to  Bischoff, is so inconsiderable that, unless we suppose these sources  much more active than now, it would take millions of years to affect  materially the constitution of the air. But even this refuge is taken  away, when we recollect that volcanoes and springs derive their car-  bonic acid from carbonates, and chiefly from carbonate of lime, or com-  mon limestone. But limestones, according to the testimony of all who  have carefully studied them, and particularly according to the recent  microscopic observations of Sorby, are entirely of animal origin, i. e.  entirely made up of broken fragments of shells, corals, crinoids, some-  times recognizable under the microscope, sometimes reduced to impal-  pable powder. This carbonate of lime is evidently derived from  sea- water. Whence, then, does sea-water derive its carbonate of lime?  The lime is derived, beyond doubt, from igneous rocks, the carbonic  acid probably from the atmosphere, through the animal and vegetable  kingdoms, since lime exists in igneous rocks not as a carbonate but as  10 s   146 LECTUEES  a silicate. It would seem to follow, then, that springs and volcanoes,  also, only return to the atroosphere what had been previously taken  from it. The only difference between these sources and the three first  is, that while decomposition, combustion, and respiration return to  the air what had been taken from it hut a little while before, springs  and volcanoes return to the air what had been taken from it during  some previous geological epoch. Thus the atmosphere becomes the  great original source of all the carbonic acid in the world.  But whatever be the cause of the excess of carbonic acid in the at-  mosphere during the coal period, we cannot fail to see an evident and  beneficent design in its removal. Carbonic acid, as is well known, is  as poisonous to animals as it is nourishing to plants. Previous to the  coal period there lived none but aquatic animals of low order. These,  on account of low vitality, sluggish circulation, and little necessity  for rapid and constant oxygenation of the blood, have great endurance  of carbonic acid. But now the earth was prepared to receive air-  breathing animals, the atmosphere must be purified for the purpose.  This was accomplished by the astonishing vegetation of the coal period.  But observe, and never cease to admire and wonder, that the self-same  providential act which purified the atmosphere and rendered the earth  a fit habitation for reptiles and birds, had reference also to the coming  of man countless ages after, and laid up materials for his use. In the  carbon thus silently extracted from the atmosphere was buried a me-  chanical energy which, after a sleep of millions of years, was to rise  again as the great physical regenerator of the human race.  ORIGIN OF COAL.  It is now universally admitted among geologists that coal is entirely  of vegetable origin. There was a time, however, and that not many  years ago, when the vegetable or mineral origin of coal was a ques-  tion warmly contested by the best geologists ; but its vegetable char-  acter is now so firmly established and so universally admitted that  the history of the controversy has lost its interest. I will not, there-  fore, tire you with its details, but proceed to state the evidence upon  which the universal belief is founded.  First, then, the enormous profusion of fossil plants, in the form of  impressions ot leaves, trunks and branches of trees, fruits, &c., found  in immediate connexion with a coal seam, afibrds strong presumption  in its favor. In the second place, this presumption is strengthened,\"  and becomes, in fact, almost certainty in the case of trunks of trees  retaining their external conformation, and under the microscope their  internal structure even to the minutest sculpturing upon their cell  walls, and yet turned to perfect coal. It might possibly be objected  that it may be a substitution of one substance for another, similar to  what takes place in petrification, where we find, also, the external  conformation and internal structure perfectly preserved, but the  organic matter all gone, that the ancient trunk having been buried  in bituminous matter and thoroughly impregnated therewith, as  particle by particle the woody matter was removed by decomposition  the bituminous matter took its place, and thus perfectly imitated its   ON COAL. 147  structure. But this objection is forever set aside, whfin, in the third  place, we subject even the most structureless coal to microscopic  scrutiny. The distinguished American microscopist, Professor Bailey,  of West Point, has been able to detect the unmistakable evidences of  vegetable structure even in the hardest anthracite. In fact it may be  affirmed that there is no coal which, under careful examination, will  not reveal a vegetable structure.  Again : All the stages of gradation between perfect wood and per-  fect coal may be traced with the greatest certainty. We find the first  stage of this process in the blackened semi-bituminized logs of our  peat bogs and deltas of the present epoch. The next stage we find in  the lignites or brown coal of the tertiary period ; the next the highly  bituminous coal of the oolite ; then the coals of the true carboniferous ;  and lastly, the anthracites of the same and lower strata. Thus we  may trace the whole embryology of coal from its immature to its most  perfect condition â€” may trace and identify all the intermediate links  of the chain of conditions of which wood and coal form the extreme  limits. But not only in external form and appearance, but also in  chemical composition we can trace these several stages. Wood con-  sists of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen ; coal consists of the same ele-  ments but in different proportions. In coal the proportion of carbon  is greater and of oxygen and hydrogen less than in wood. Now, if  we compare the chemical composition of wood, peat, lignite, bitumin-  ous coal and anthracite, we find a progressive decrease in the propor-  tion of oxygen and hydrogen, until, in anthracite, we find the carbon  almost pure, and absolutely pure in graphite, if we acknowledge this  as of similar origin. This chemical evidence is, it seems to me, abso-  lutely demonstrative.  Lastly, direct experiment proves that peat, which we know to be  of vegetable origin, may, by strong pressure, be made to assume the  hardness, the density, the general appearance, and all the useful pro-  perties of coal.  Assuming, then, the vegetable origin of coal as a basis of argu-  ment, we will proceed to speak of, and to account for, the principal  varieties of coal.  All coal consists of two parts, the one combustible the other in-  combustible. It is easy to separate these from one another. If a  piece of coal is thrown into the fire the combustible portion passes  away in the form of gases, the incombustible remains behind in the  form of ash. Now, the relative proportion of these two vary infi-  nitely in different coals. We have every stage of gradation between  pure shale and pure coal, between pure incombustible and almost as  pure combustible. In the purest coal the amount of ash is only 1 to  2 per cent.; others, more impure, contain 5, 10, 20, 50 per cent, of  ash. At this point coal loses the property of ready combustion, and  with it loses also the name of coal in popular language. Bat the  geologist recognizes no remarkable change at this particular point â€”  no scientific reason why the name should change from coal to shale,  as there is no corresponding change of nature. From this point,  under the name of shaly coal, black slate, &c., the amount of ash.  may continue to increase and the amount of combustible matter to   148 LECTURES  decrease, until, in pure shale or slate, tlie whole becomes incom-  bustible.  Now, wood consists also of combustible matter and ash, but the  amount of ash in wood is much less than in coal â€” the wood of elm  contains about 2 per cent.; willow, i half per cent.; beech, ^ per cent.;  oak and pine about ^ per cent. The leaves and bark of trees, how-  ever, contain much more than this. The fully matured leaves of the  beech, willow, and elm contain, severallj'', 6.6_, 8, and 11 per cent, of  ash. It is probable, then, that 2 to 3 per cent, is a fair average of  the per centage of ash in dry vegetable matter. But even if the coal  is perfectly pure, that is, formed of vegetable matter without foreign  admixture, we should find a higher proportion of ash than in the  wood from which it was formed, for, as we have already seen, wood  loses hydrogen and oxygen in the process of change into coal. The  weight therefore diminishes, but the absolute amount of ash remains  the same^ and consequently the relative amount increases. We may  safely say, then, that if coal contains not more than 5 per cent, of ash  it may be considered quite pure; but if it contains more than 10 per  cent, it is probably impure, i. e., mixed with foreign matter. This  foreign matter being evidently the mud or clay upon which the carbo-  naceous matter was originally laid down or by which it was after-  wards covered. Hence we find the purest coal in the largest seams  and in the middle portions equally removed from the floor and roof.  As we pass towards the roof of a seam the coal passes by imperceptible  degrees into black slate, which is, in fact, mud, more or less mixed  with carbonaceous matter.  So much for the varieties of coal depending upon purity or im-  purity, upon the relative proportion of earthy, incombustible, inorganic  matter, and of combustible organic matter.  But, aside from the earthy matter, the combustible or organic matter  of coal consi^^ts of two proximate elements mechanically mixed, viz:  carbon and bitumen; charcoal is nearly pure carbon; common tar or  pitch is very similar both in chemical composition and in general ap-  pearance to bitumen. If, then, we conceive a piece of charcoal, care-  fully burnt so that the vegetable structure is perfectly retained, to be  thoroughly impregnated with pitch or tar, we should have a substance  extremely similar to common coal. These two ingredients of coal  may also be easily separated from one another. This is constantly  done in the process of coking and in the manufacture of illuminating  gas. The more volatile bitumen is driven olF in the form of gas or  collects in the pipes as coal tar and the carbon remains as coke.  Now, the relative proportion of these two ingredients also vary infi-  nitely in different coals. We may have a coal of pure carbon, or a  coal of pure bitumen, or a coal containing these two in every propor-  tion. It is the relative proportion of these which give rise to the  principal varieties of coal. A coal of pure carbon is called anthracite ;  with a small amount of bitumen, say 10 to 20 per cent., it is called  dry coals or semi-bituminous coal; when there is 20 to 30 per cent, of  bitumen it is called bituminous or coking coal ; when the per centage  is above this and the coal burns with a strong blaze and melts, it is  called fat coals. Besides these there are certain varieties depending   ON COAL. 149  upon hardness, fracture, &c., such, for instance, as cannel, wliich is a  highly hituminous coal, hut very hard, compact, fine-grained, and  remarkably free from vegetable structure ; splint coal, &c.  There are at least three possible methods of accounting for these  varieties. 1st. The cause may have existed before the coal was laid  down, in the nature of the wood of which the coals were formed.  2d. The cause may be sought for in the changes through which the  vegetable matter passed in the process of becoming coal. ^ 3d. We  may find it in changes to which the coal was subjected after it became  coal.  First. It is possible that the kind of wood may in some degree_ de-  termine the variety of coal, as, for instance, the accumulation of pines  and other resinous wood may have given rise to the fat coals, while  the non-resinous woods to the drier coals. This, I say, is possible,  particularly as we know that coniferous trees grew in considerable  abundance during the coal period ; but it seems very improbable as a  general explanation.  Second. We have already remarked that wood consists, chemically,  of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and a small quantity of nitrogen, which  may be neglected ; ancl that pit coal consists of the same chemical  elements, only in different proportions, the carbon being in excess.  It is obvious, then, that in the fermentation process by which wood  is changed into coal a portion of the gases, hydrogen and oxygen,  escapes. The amount which thus escapes determines the variety of coal.  The composition of wood is variously stated by chemists ; in fact it  is not a definite compound, but consists of the mixture of several  proximate principles. It therefore varies much, according to the rela-  tive^ abundance of these principles, such as starch, sugar, cellulose,  lignire ; in other words, according to the kind or even the age of the  wood. For the harder kinds of wood, such as the oak, Liebeg gives  the formula, 0,5 H,2 O.,,. For softer kinds of wood, and par-  ticularly for succulent Vegetable substances, the proportion of carbon  is not so great. Whether, however, the formula which I have  adopted be correct for the plants of the coal, or not, would not affect  the general correctness of the reasoning upon which my conclusions  are based. The composition of bitumen varies also very much, and  for the same reason, viz : that it is composed of several proximate  principles variously mixed. It is generally given as C. Hj^g, and  a variable but small amount of oxygen, from 2 to 4. The composition  of cannel coal is given byRegnault as 0.4 H^^g Oj.  Wood = C36 B.,, 0,,  Bitumen.... = Coq H^g 0,  Cannel coal = C^^ E.^^ 0^  It will be seen that the proportion of carbon is greatest in coal and  least in bitumen, but that the most striking difference between these  substances and wood is the almost entire want of oxygen. Now, ac-  cording to Liebeg, wood in the process of decay in the open air forms  carbonic acid (0 O2) and water (II 0,) and the carbonic acid is  formed by the union of the carbon with the oxygen of the wood, while  the water is formed by the union of the hydrogen of the wood with   150 LECTURES  the oxygen of the air. As in the formation of carbonic acid, oxygen  is consumed faster than the carbon ; if the decay goes on the residue  will be at least pure carbon.  Wood =1 Cgg H33 O22  Deduct C O3 -f- H (the H unites with of air) = Cgg B.^^ 0^^ rr partly decayed.  Deduct 5 (CO3) (=05 0^0) + 11 H = C30 H^q O^q r=: further decayed.  But if decomposition take place out of contact, or with limited sup-  ply of air, the process is more complex. The carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen combine with one another in various proportions, and the pro-  ducts of decomposition are : carbonic acid (C 0^,,) carburetted hydro-  gen (C H2 or C, H,,) and water (H 0,) and thus result the deadly  choke-damp (C 0^) and the dreaded fire-damp (C H.^) of the coal  mines.  Let us now see how, according to this theory, the different varieties  of coal may be formed.  Wood = C,6 H^, 0,  Deductll CO, =:Cii O22 I ^ r tt n  Deduct 22 H oxydized by the air ] \" ^n -^22 ^-'at  and twenty-five atoms of carbon alone remain ; and this is the com-  postion of pure anthracite. Again : If decomposition takes place out  of contact of air, bitumen or bituminous coal is formed. Thus â€”  Wood = C,6 H,, O22  Deduct 9 C 0, = 0, 0,, )  Deduct 3 HO = \" H, 3 f = C^^ H , O^i  Deduct 3 C H^ = C3 H^^ ) â–   The remainder is cannel coal = 0,4 H^, ^  Again :  Wood = C36 H^o O22  and if from this we deduct  10 atoms carbonic acid =Cio 0., 0? ^ -rr p.  3 atoms defiant gas = C ^ H ^ \" \\ ~ ^'^ ^ <^ ^^'Â«  the remainder is bitumen zi: C20 H^g 2  In the same manner, by supposing the union of these three elements  to take place in various proportions, under circumstances of more or  less imperfect access of air, we may, without difficulty, account for all  the different varieties of coal.  There can be no doubt, it seems to me, that bituminous coal is ac-  tually formed by this play of affinities. But with reference to the  extremes of this series, viz: anthracite and bitumen, naptha, &c., it  seems rnuch more probable that these have been the result of an after  change, the last of the three possible causes with which we started.  In the third place,, then, we have many reasons for believing that  bituminous coal is really the normal coal, and that which is always  formed by the play of affinities, of which we have spoken above, and  that anthracite and bitumen are the result of the action of igneous  agency upon such bituminous coal.   ON COAL. 151  We have already said that bituminous coal may be considered as a  mechanical mixture of carbon and bitumen, and these two may easily  be separated by heat. Anthracite is the residue after separation, and  bitumen and naptha is the matter separated by distillation and con-  densed elsewhere. As in the gas manufactories we find bituminous  coal decomposed â€” a part remaining behind as coke, (pure carbon,) a  part passing off as gas and a part collecting in pipes as coal tar â€” so  in the laboratory of Nature coal beds subjected to heat give rise to the  same three substances ; anthracite is left behind, coal gas is dis-  charged into the atmosphere and bitumen collects in subterranean  pipes and gives rise to naptha and bituminous springs, pitch lakes,  &c. Thus, the enormous lake of boiling pitch in Trinidad is, proba-  bly, in connexion with coal strata below. If so, such coal will be left  in the condition of anthracite. All the strata of the earth are subject  to change under the influence of heat: limestones become marbles,  clays become slate. This change is called by geologists metamor-  phism. Now, the proposition is that anthracite is metamorphic coal.  The proofs of this proposition are as follows :  In the first place, anthracite is never found except in regions very  much disturbed by igneous agency, the strata highly inclined, contorted  and broken ; and even in the same coal field the coal is anthracite or  bituminous, according as the region is more or less disturbed. Thus,  in eastern Pennsylvania^ where the coal strata are very much con-  torted and sometimes perpendicular, (fig. 9,) the coal is all anthra-  cite ; while in western Pennsylvania, where the strata are nearly  horizontal, the coal is bituminous. The actual transition of anthra-  cite into bituminous coal cannot be studied with advantage in Penn-  sylvania, because the coal strata have been carried away to such an  extent that only outlying patches are left ; but in Wales the same  seam may be traced from the bituminous to the anthracite condition ;  so that there can be no doubt that, in this case at least, anthracite is  metamorphic coal.  Second. Anthracite is never found except in metamorphic rocks,  and conversely all coal contained in metamorphic strata is anthracite.  This universal connexion of two things proves, as it seems to me,  beyond doubt, their community of origin ; that they have a common  cause. Thus, in the lowest stratified or primary rocks, where the  rocks are altogether metamorphic, and even in the silurian, where a  less complete metamorphism is almost universal, what little coal is  found is always anthracite. In the coal measures we have coal both  bituminous and anthracitic, but the anthracite always in altered and  the bituminous in unaltered rocks. As we pass upward we find  anthracite more rare, because metamorphism is more rare and local ;  and when metamorphism entirely disappears in the tertiary rocks we  find that anthracite disappears also.  Third. Trap dykes, as it is well known, are formed by the out-  breaking and outpouring of melted rock (lava) forced up through  the superincumbent stratified rocks, which are altered and rendered  metamorphic by the contact. Now, when a dyke passes through coal  strata the coal is alwa,ys thoroughly coked by the contact ; that is, it  is changed into a substance identical in chemical composition with   152 LECTURES  anthracite. These two substances are doubtless similar in their  origin as well as in chemical composition, the great difference in their  density being due only to the pressure under which the change took  place. Anthracite is produced slowly under enormous pressure, while  coke is produced under ordinary atmospheric pressure, and the rapid  disengagement of gas renders it light and porous.  THE PLANTS OF THE COAL â€” THEIR STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES.  Geology is the latest developed among the sciences. This is not an  accidental phenomenon in the history of human intellectual progress,  but one absolutely necessary, and the cause of which we can clearly  trace. The great divisions of science in the order of their complexity  are mathematics, mechanical sciences, chemical sciences, organical  sciences, and geology. The first is limited to ideas of number and  quantity ; the second comprises, in addition to the preceding, ideas of  force ; the third, in addition, ideas of chemical affinity ; the fourth, in  addition to the preceding, ideas of life, and the last, in addition to  all the preceding, ideas of historic development. Now, this order of  increasing complexity has necessitated a corresponding order of devel-  opment in time. It is impossible that mechanics and physics should  have assumed even the form of a science until mathematics was  already mature. And so of the rest. Together they form a column,  of which mathematics is the pediment and geology the capital ; or,  rather, I should say, a magnificent temple, of which mathematics  forms the solid foundation and geology the heaven pointing spire ; the  most wonderful and perfect work which human genius has erected in  honor of Deity.  It is evident, therefore, that geology was compelled to await the  development of other sciences. She could not come forward until her  time was fulfilled, for her problems are the most complex and difficult  which are to be found in the whole range of science. It is evident,  also, that the geologist must be thoroughly accomplished in all de-  partments of science. He must be thoroughly grounded in mechanical  and physical sciences, or how shall he reason successfully on the up-  heaval of continents, the formation of mountain chains, the dynamics  of earthquakes and volcanoes, the actions of currents, &c. He must  be familiar with chemistry, for disintegration and consolidation of  rocks, the deposits of springs, the formation of coal^ are chemical  quebtions. Still more necessary to him is an acquaintance with organic  science, for the organic remains are the Divine hieroglyphs in which  the history of the earth is recorded. It is this very complexity^ this  very elevation in the scale, this almost universal culture required of  her votaries, which constitutes the greatest obstacle in the way of real  progress in this science. I know it is thought by many that geology  is an easy and simple science, that any one, by industrious collection  of fossils and persevering exercise of memory^ may be a good geolo-  gist ; but this is a sad and very pernicious error. In so vast a science  collectors of materials must be numerous, but the philosophical gen-  eralizer is very rare. In so vast an edifice the fetchers of stone and  brick and mortar are innumerable, but heaps of brick and stone and   ON COAL. 153  mortar do not constitute a temple ; the one may be accumulated by  the human hand, the other can be constructed only by the human  mind, and in this case only by genius of the highest order. In fact,  a master builder in this sc:ence has not yet lived. No man has yet  been able to sketch the outlines of this noble work with a hand so firm  and decided that all shall labor in harmony and mutual confidence,  and the work shall thenceforward proceed with steadiness and cer-  tainty.  In some sense, therefore, all departments of science may be looked  upon as the handmaids of geology. And it is curious and instructive  to observe how, in reward for their services, she stamps each one with  the seal of philosophy ; how each science becomes, in her service,  more comprehensive, more philosophic, more exact. The problems  in physics and chemistry which geology proposes are so difficult, the  conditions under which well known forces act are so numerous and  complicated, and the scale on which they operate are so vast, that  every formula must be revised, every law must be made more exact.  Thus, under the guidance of geology, these two old and mature  sciences seem entering on a new and higher career.  But perhaps the most remarkable instance of the favorable change  and philosophic character which the advent of geology has impressed  upon other departments of science is to be found in the case of natural  history.  The zoology and botany of the last age were little more than the  knowledge of the names and external forms of species, and their ar-  rangement according to an arbitrary system of classification. But it  is evident that such zoology and botany can be of little service to  geology. The external form of an extinct species is seldom seen.  G-enerally all that we have of an animal is a few bones or teeth, some-  times a single scale ; of a plant, a fragment of wood or a leaf, and the  problem which geology proposes is, from such meagre materials to  reconstruct the whole organism. To the unskilled this seems impos-  sible. But the harmony which exists between all parts of an organ-  ism is so perfect that each may be said to necessitate every other. A  complete knowledge of the laws of organization would thus enable us,  from any one part^ to reconstruct the whole. One strain of song in-  stantly suggests all that is necessary to make the harmony complete.  Thus a profounder knowledge of animals and plants becomes neces-  sary â€” a knowledge not only of external forms, but also of internal  structure and the harmonious relation of parts. Classification is no  longer an ingenious artifice to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge,  but becomes the highest expression of knowledge, the epitome of na-  ture. Thus, from a mere mass of barren details, natural history has  risen to the highest philosophic rank. Even astronomy has been  compelled to take a lesson of philosophy from her younger sister.  She must relax the severity of her dogmas. She must modify some-  what the absoluteness of her assertions concerning the staoility of all  things, fenced, though they be, round about with mathematical for-  mula3, now since the idea of infinite time has been introduced by  geology. ^' The causes which tend to destroy the stability of the solar  system,\" says astronomy, \"are infinitely small, and therefore may   154 LECTDEE8  be rejected from the equation.\" True, but infinitely small quantities  accumulating through infinite ages become finite, in fact, become very  important ; for it is these very same infinitely small residual quanti-  ties, rejected by astronomy as of no value, which, by their accumula-  tion, constitute the progressive development of the earth and solar  system. Without such small uncompensated forces history, whether  geological, national, or individual, would be impossible. An insect  philosopher, the span of whose life is a single day, attentively ob-  serving the daily cycle of the healthy human body, might rationally  assert the stability of the human system. The body, at the end of  twenty-four hours, has come back to the same spot whence it started.  At least the variation, if any, must be infinitely small, and therefore,  for all purposes of insect life, may be rejected as of no value. And  yet it is the accumulation of this same infinitely small variation which  constitutes the growth and progressive development of the body. This  is not an exaggerated illustration, for 2,000 years, the whole age of  astronomy, is but one day, yea, but a small fraction of a day, in the  geological history of the earth.  The flora of the coal period is more complete than that of any pre-  vious or succeeding geological epoch. The whole number of fossil  species of plants known is probably not far from 2,000. Of these,  according to estimates made more than ten years ago, about 816 are  from the \" coal measures.\" The constant additions which have been  made since that time, particularly by Dr. Newberry and others, from  an examination of the coal fields of our own country, would probably  bring the number up to at least 900. Probably, therefore, nearly if  not quite one-half of all known fossil plants belong to this period. I  have already said that a coal seam is made up of the remains of such  plants, yet it is not in the coal seams themselves that we find the best  preserved specimens of coal plants. On the contrary, the vegetable  matter is here so thoroughly disorganized that it is only by means of  the microscope that we are able to detect its original structure. It is  rather in the associated shale strata that the most beautiful impres-  sions occur, particularly in the overlying hlach slate. Between the  thin sheets of this slate the stems and leaves are as perfiectly preserved,  every vein and nerve, as between the leaves of the botanist's herbarium.  This fact, viz : that the well-preserved plants are always found in  abundance in this position, and never in the coal seam proper has, as  it seems to me, an important bearing upon the theory of coal de-  posit. But of this we shall speak again in another place. You have  here before you a magnificent slab of black slate, profusely covered  with beautiful impressions of leaves and stems of ferns and calamites.  In this case, as perhaps in most others, the impressions, though well-  defined, are not conspicuous at a distance, because the color of the  ground and of the figures are so nearly alike, but in some cases, when  the shale background is light-colored, the relief of the coal-black  impressions is very beautiful. The newly exposed roof of a coal mine  has been compared by Dr. Buckland to the most magnificent fresco  painted ceilings of Italian buildings.  But although the number of species of coal plants is so great, yet   ON COAL. 155  coal is supposed to be composed principally of tlie remains of four  families only, viz : Ferns, Sigillaria', Lepidodendrons , and Cdlamiles.  The abundance of individuals belonging to these families is so great,  and their size so enormous, that they must have given character to  the vegetation of this period, and may therefore be taken as represen-  tatives of its flora. As such, therefore, I shall consider them, and it  will be our object in this lecture to give you some idea of their appear-  ance and affinities.  There are certain periods in the history of our race upon which we  are apt to gaze with peculiar interest and admiration â€” when the  human mind, awakening from its sleep of barbarism, rejoices in the  ostentatious display of its strength and its beauty, so in the history  of our earth, the period of the coal stands out beyond all others as the  ^^ heroic oge,\" when nature seemed to delight herself in the fantastic  exercise of power, and to exhaust her strength in the production of  vegetable giants and monsters. It will be my object to show that this  age, although to the popular mind it may appear a mythological age,  an age of wonders and prodigies, an age to which ordinary principles  of reasoning are inapplicable ; that this age is but one chapter, a page,  in a connected history^ one step in the accomplishment of the unvary-  ing plans of Deity.  A glance at these drawings of coal plants will give you some general  idea of the strange forms which constituted the flora of this period.  But it is not only a vague general idea of external form which I wish  to give you ; we have already had too much of this in popular lectures  on geology. If we would grasp the real thought expressed in the  vegetation of this period ; if we would understand the true significance  of the coal flora in the Divine economy ; if we would catch the key-  note of this Divine harmony, we must take more than a superficial  glance â€” we must look deeply, thoughtfully, reverently. But, in order  to make myself understood, I find it necessary to step a little out of  the way, to give you a sketch of the great divisions of the vegetable  kingdom and the characteristics of each, so that, by comparison, we  may be able to determine the position of the coal plants. Whatever  is noble and elevating in science must be equally interesting to every  intelligent mind ; but in order to appreciate it, it is absolutely neces-  sary to master in some degree uninteresting technicalities. The jewel  is inclosed always in an unattractive casket of lead ; we must find the  key before we can gain the prize.  The vegetable kingdom, then, is divided into two great classes: the  Fhcenogajns, or flowering plants, and the Cryptogams, or flowerless.  The Cryptogams may be again divided into cellular and vascular Cryp-  togams. The cellular Cryptogams, such as the mosses, fungi lichens,  sea weeds, &c., consist entirely of cellular tissue, while the vascular  Cryptogams, such as ferns, club-mosses, equisetaceae, (horse-tails,) com-  bine the vascular tissue with the cellular. The Phoinogams may also  be divided into two sub-classes, viz : the Gymnosperms, or naked seeded  plants, and the Angiosperms, or covered seeded plants. The Gymnos-  perms bear their seeds naked or exposed, either near the base of an  open capillary leaf, as in the pine family, {Co7iifers,) fig. 12, or else   156   LECTURES   Fig. ii.

The Angiosperms, on the  contrary, bear their seeds enfolded within  the capillary leaf or seed vessel, (figs. 14 and  15,) as in all the ordinary flowering plants.  The Angiosperms are again subdivided into  3fonocolyledons, (one cotyledon or seed leaf  in the embryo,) fig. 16, and Dicotyledons,  (t wo seed leaves in the embryo,) fig. 17.    Fig. 16.

Now, the most important means of determining the families of coal  plants are the internal structure of the stem and the venation of the  leaves. Generally, indeed, these are the only means at oi'ir command.  Let ns inquire, then, how the great divisions of the vegetable king-  dom are characterized in these respects.  Among Phcenogams there are two very distinct types or plans of  internal structure of the stem, viz : the Exogenous, or outside-growing,  and the Endogenous, or inside-growing ; the one represented by the  hard-wood trees and shrubs, the other by the palms, canes, grasses,  &c. On cross section of an exogen (fig. 18) we find three distinct  zones of tissue. In the centre a zone of cellular tissue, the pith ;  exterior to this a zone of wood, and around this again a zone of cellular  tissue, the bark. The zone of wood is, moreover, subdivided into con-  centric rings, which represent the annual layers of growth, and sepa-  rated into wedges by radiating lines of cellular tissue (silver grain)  connecting the cellular tissue of the pith with the cellular tissue of  the bark. In the Endogens,  on the contrary, we have the  woody tissue in the form of  thread-like bundles, irregu-  larly interspersed amongst  the cellular. The dry stalk  of an Indian corn is a fa-  miliar illustration of this  structure. If such a stalk is  broken across and the two  parts careiuUy separated , the  thread-like bundles of woody and vascular tissue are observed to draw   Fig. 18    ON COAL. 157  out from the softer cellular tissue. Here we o'bserve no distinct pitli ; on  distinct bark separable from the wood ; the wood not collected into a  distinct zone; not arranged into concentric layers, nor divided by me-  dullary rays. The exogenous plan of structure includes the Dicoty-  ledons and the pine and cycas families ; while endogen may be con-  sidered synonymous with monocotyledon.  In the vascular Cryptogams the woody and vascular tissue is still  differently arranged. The stem of a club-moss, for instance, consists  of a mass of cellular tissue inclosed in a rind of the same tissue more  condensed, with a single central thread of vascular tissue. Sometimes  there seems to be in the centre of this something like a very imperfect  pith. The cellular Cryptogams, as their name indicates^ consist  entirely of cellular tissue.  It will be observed that, in the general structure and mode of  growth, the family of pines (Gymnosperms) is allied to the highest  order of plants, viz: the Dicotyledons, while in its reproduction it is  below the Monocotyledons. This latter position is beyond doubt the  true one ; and a more attentive examination of the wood of pine in  comparison with that of Dicotyledons will confirm us in this view.  As this is a very important point, and as much false theorizing on  the subject of the plants of the coal has been the result of a miscon-  ception of the true position of conifers, I will dwell a little more  minutely than I should have otherwise considered it necessary to do.  The wood oi' Dicotyledons consists of two dis- Fis. 20.  tmct tissues, viz: the woody tissue jiroper and the  vascular tissue. The woody tissue proper is com-  posed of elongated cells, too small to be distin-  guished by the naked eye, while the vascular tissue  is composed of very much larger cells or tubes.  The visible pores in such wood as oak^ chestnut,  vine, &c., belong to this tissue. Fig. 20 repre-  sents cross section of two wooden wedges, with  their medullary rays. The comparative size of  the wood cells and the vessels is well shown. The  difference is often much greater than in the figure.  In pine wood, on the contrary, there is no distinction of woody and  vascular tissue; but the so-called wood consists entirely of an open,  thin-walled tissue, intermediate in every respect between the vas-  cular and the woody layer and thinner walled than the true woody,  but smaller than the true vascular. This is shown in the cross  section, (fig. 21.) On a longitudinal section, (fig. 22,) the cells  of pine wood are marked by large disc-like elliptical plates, which  are entirely characteristic of this family. The smallest fragment  is sufficient to distinguish it with the utmost certainty.  Now, if we trace the development of the tissues, either by passing  from the lowest to the highest plants, or from the earliest embryonic  to the mature condition of one of the higher plants, we shall find that  all the different kinds of tissue are modifications of the cellular ; that  there is a more and more complete differentiation of form and special-    158   LECTURES   <    Fig. 23.   Figs 21 and 22. izatioQ of fuDctioii as development progresses.  The longitudinal system is first formed by modifi-  cation of the cellular, and then this is again differ-  entiated into the two forms of woody and vascular  tissue. Now, in the pine family, this last differ-  entiation has not taken place. So far as its tissues  are concerned, therefore^ this family should rank  helow all other flowering plants.  Let us next examine the different classes of  plants with respect to the venation of their leaves.  With respect to their venation the leaves of  plants are divided into three distinct kinds, viz :  the reticulated, or netted veined, the parallel  veined, and the dicholomously veined. In the  first the veins branch and again run together,  forming an inextricable net-work, (Fig. 23, a.)  In the second the veins run parallel from one end  of the leaf to the other, connected only by slender  transverse bars, so that the leaf may be torn into  parallel rib-  bons. (Fig.  23, &.) In the  third the veins  branch, but do  not run to-  gether again.  (Fig. 23, c and  d.) The first  is characteris-  tic of the Dico-  tyledons ; the  second of the*  3Ionocotyle-  dons; and the  third of the Ferns â€” perhaps of the vascular Cryptogams generally.  The leaves of cellular Cryptogams are veinless. In this enume-  ration it will be observed I have not mentioned the Conifers. To  which class, then, do the leaves of the pine family belong? Undoubt-  edly to the third. This fact cannot be easily demonstrated upon  leaves of ordinary pines, for their cylindrical leaves show no veins,  or, if visible, they seem to be parallel. But there are a few broad-  leaved Conifers, and these always show the dichotomous branch-  ing of the veins in the most unmistakable manner. In the  Salisburia, for instance, we have as beautiful an instance of this  mode of branching as can be found among the Ferns. The leaves  of this Conifer are about two or three inches broad, the shape and  venation very similar to that represented in Fig. 23, c, but much  more beautii'ul. This close alliance in the venation of the leaves  between the pines and the ferns is another evidence of the low  position of the former among flov.'ering plants. Thus it appears that  this remarkable family of plants is allied to the highest Fhcenogams     ON COAL. 169  in the general structure of its wood, and to the Cryptogams in the  venation of its leaves. If there was no other evidence we might he in  douht as to its true position ; but the simplicity of its reproduction  and of its tissues settles the question, as it seems to me, forever.  There are other points of alliance between pines and club-mosses,  which it would lead me too far to notice. In fact this family seems  to be, in a remarkable degree, both a connecting and an embryonic  type, and therefore, as we shall presently see^ eminently calculated  to throw light upon the plants of the coal.  Let us now attempt to apply these principles in the interpretation  of the plants of the Coal, and particularly of the four families already  taken as representatives of the flora of this period, viz: the Ferns ,  Sigillarice, Lepidodendron, and Calamites. We shall confine our atten-  tion principally to the second and third. With reference to the  Fertis there is little dispute ; their unmistakable resemblance to the  ferns of the present flora leave no doubt as to their afiinities. I will  only remark, in passing, that many of the coal genera of this family  seem to have affinities also with the Cycadce and Coni/erce. With  reference to the other three families the difficulty is much greater^  they are generally supposed, however, to be most nearly allied to the  Lycopodiacece (club-mosses) and the Equisetacece, (horse-tails ;) the  Sigillarice and Lepidodendrons being considered most nearly allied to  the club-mosses, and the Calamites to the horse-tails. If so, then we  are at once struck with the enormous size of the coal plants in com-  parison with their humble representatives at the present day. Sigil-  larice and Lepidodendrons attained the amazing height of seventy to  one hundred feet, and a diameter of five to six feet, while the club-  mosses of the present day seldom rise to an altitude of more than a  few inches. Calamites attain a diameter of fourteen or fifteen inches,  and a height of thirty to forty feet, while the horse-tails are among  our humblest plants. This enormous difference in size is sufficient of  itself to lead us to suspect that these are not true club-mosses and  horse-tails. Let us examine them more closely.  Here you have rude sketches of these families. This is Sigillaria.  This genus is so little known as to its external appearance that I  cannot represent or speak of it with any confidence. In almost every  case it is ibrmed as a straight cylindrical trunk, without branches or  leaves. So that, although this plant is so common, yet its mode of  branching and the form of its leaves is still a matter of dispute among  botanists. In a few cases Sigillaria trunks have been found to bifurcate  and produce long cylindrical branches. In a single, perhaps doubt-  ful, case {Sig. Icpidodendrifolia) leaves have been found similar to  Lepidodendron. One of two views seems probable : either that many  so-called Lepidodendrons, so commonly found in connexion with  Sigillaria, are the branches of the latter, in which case the branching  and foliage of this genus are similar to tbe Lepidodendron, or else  that Sigillaria, like tree ferns, were generally branchless, and that the  large fronds, (generally supposed to belong to Ferns,) which are po  commonly found strewed in profusion about their bases, were their  leaves. What I have represented by these sketches are therefore  ideal restorations on the former hypothesis, rather than actual speci-   160   LECTURES   mens. You will observe, then, the sparse dichotomous branching, the  cylindrical limbs with blunt extremities, so characteristic of the club-  moss, but which is found^ also, in some species of pines. Like the club-  moss, too, the leaves are crowded, pointed, strung along the stem for  some distance, but longer, slenderer, and more nearly resembling the  leaves of the pine. On this trunk you will observe the seal-like im-  pressions {sigilla) characteristic of this family, and from which its  name is derived. Also longitudinal depressions running from one  end of the trunk to the other, and along which the sigilla are arranged  in vertical rows. Thus each trunk of a Sigillaria resembled a noble  fluted doric ^column beautifully but variously sculptured the pattern  changing with the species. These sigillae are evidently leaf scars,  and therefore indicate the leaf arrangement peculiar to this family.  The Lepidodendron, of which you have here a drawing, was still  more like the club-moss, the crowded leaves being shorter, rhomboidal,  and more scale like, the same long, slender, cylindrical, sparse dichot-  omous branches. But even here we find an almost equal resem-  blance to Conifers, for it will be recollected that in a large number  of Conifers as the Juniperus, the Araucaria, &c., the same rhomboidal,  j)laited scale-like leaves prevail. The impression of a shoot of an Araii-  caria could scarcely be distinguished from that of some species of club-  moss, except by superior size of the former. In its fructification there  is the same difficulty, for it is doubtful whether it most nearly resem-  bled the cone of pines, or the cone-like fructification of club-mosses,  although the recent investigations of Hooker leave little doubt that  the latter is the truer view. All that we know, then, of the external  appearance of these families lead us to the conclusion that they were  intermediate between pines and club-mosses, and that the Sigillaria  approached most nearly the pines, and the Lejndodendj^ons most nearly  the club-mosses.  Let us next see what light is thrown upon this subject by examina-  tion of the internal structure.  Fig. 24. Fi\". 25.

Cross and longitudinal section of Sigillaria;  letters represent same as in fig. 24; /// the  leaves.   ON COAL.   161   If we make a section of the stem of a Sigillaria, (figs 24 and 25,) we  find externally a hai^k, or, more probably, a rind{a) of condensed cellu-  lar tissue, sometimes a half or an inch thick; within this an enormous  amount of loose cellular tissue, (c,) often 2 feet or more thick. Through  the centre of this runs a slender sheath(J) of vascular or woody tissue,  which in a Sigillaria 5 feet in diameter is not more than 3 inches in  diameter ; a mere thread of vascular in the midst of a mass of cellular  tissue. This again incloses a small pith (a) which occupies the very  centre of the trunk. These vascular cylinders, with their inclosed pith,  being the most indestructible portion of the trunk, are often found  alone, and described under the name of Endogenites. Figs. 24 and 25  represent cross and longitudinal ideal sections of this plant, (a) the  cellular tissue of the pith, (h) the vascular or woody sheath, (c) the  mass of cellular tissue between the vascular sheath and (d) the rind,  (e) slender vascular bundles connecting the leaves with the central  sheath. Upon closer examination of this woody or vascular cylinder  (b) it is found to consist of concentric layers, somewhat analogous to the  layers of growth of exogenous trees, and divided into wedges by medul-  lary rays, like the tree exogens. Upon still closer examination, how-  ever, of a good cross section under a microscope (fig. 26) no distinction  of vascular and woody tissue, such as is found in the wood of Dicotylo-  dons, is observed, but the whole is made up of one kind of tissue, open  and thin-walled, in comparison with woody tissue proper, but closely  resembling the wood of pines. But a longitudinal section shows no  disc-like markings such as characterize the wood of Conifers, but  Figs. 26 and 27. Fig. 28.    Fig. 28. A cross section and longitudinal section  of a Sigillaria. The letters a, b, e, d, e represent  same a.s in previous figs. 1, 2, 3 are the 3 layers  of the vascular cylinder 6, wi isa medullary ray'.  reveals the fact that it consists entirely of spiral vessels, (figs. 27 and  27;) and that, therefore, the sheath of the Sigillaria consists of vascular  rather than of woody tissue. In consequence of the great predomi-  nance of cellular tissue, these stems, as well as those of the Lepido-  dendron and Calamites, are generally found very much flattened bv  pressure. ''  11 s   162   LECTURES   A cross and longitudinal section of the Lepidodendron shows  similar but still less highly organized structure, (figs. 29 and 30.)   Fig. 29.   Fig. 30.    The vascular sheath is still smaller, extremely thin, forming on  cross section an exceedingly narrow zone. It is moreover not separated  into concentric rings nor divided by medullary rays. The cellular  tissue both within and without the sheath is very open and loose.  The rind {d) consists of similar cellular tissue, but more condensed,  and there seems to be no line of demarcation, but a gradual transition;  in other words, there is apparently no true bark. Here, also, we find  long slender bundles of vascular tissue (spiral vessels) connecting the  leaves with the central sheath. Microscopic examination of the vas-  cular sheath shows no sign of woody tissue.  Calamites we know much less about, but it would seem that in them  there is a still greater predominance of cellular tissue, if, indeed, they  possessed any vascular tissue at all. They are often found pressed  perfectly flat, indicating that they were either hollow, or more probably  consisted of a simple rind of condensed cellular tissue, inclosing looser  tissue of the same kind. Of this plant, however, we know too little to  draw any conclusion as to its affinities.  Now, if we examine by sections a common Lycopodmm, or club-moss,  we find an internal structure closely resembling what we have found  in Sigillaria and Lepidodendron. Externally a thin but tough rind,  or epidermis of condensed cellular tissue, inclosing a mass of very loose  cellular tissue, through the centre of which runs a slender thread of  vascular tissue, sending off in every direction still slenderer threads of  the same to the crowded leaves. Upon longitudinal section the vascu-  lar tissue is found to be chiefly spiral ducts. The principal difference  between this structure and that of the Lepidodendron is that the latter  has a more perfect pith, and in this respect seems to be allied to the  higher order of plants. But I am convinced, from personal examina-  tion of the Lycopodium, that its vascular thread was the outline of both  pith and medullary rays. I call more particular attention to this  observation, because^ as far as I know, it is new, and as it seems to me  calculated to throw much light on the affinities of coal plants.  This very remarkable structure, viz : the existence of a slender  central thread of vascular tissue in the midst of a large mass of very  loose cellular, does not exist, I believe, among existing plants in the   ON COAL. 163  mature condition, except in the family of club-mosses. In tlie embry-  onic state, however, of the Dicotyledons we find something similar.  If we make a cross section of a Dicotyledon soon after germination,  t. e., while the first two or three pairs of leaves are expanding, we will  find a structure very similar to that of the Lepidodendron. We find  in the centre a small pith surrounded by a thin zone of vascular tissue,  (mostly spiral vessels,) around this a large mass of cellular tissue, des-  tined to become partly bark and partly wood_, but which is yet neither  one nor the other, and the whole inclosed in a thin epidermis of con-  densed cellular tissue.  Thus it appears, both from external and internal examination, that  these families combined the characters of pines and club-mosses. Or  if we are disposed to attach moro importance to their exogenous affini-  ties, and thus to place them among the pines, then we must compare  them with the earliest embryonic condition of this class. The true  view, I am convinced, is, that they are both connecting and embryonic  types, or connecting types with embryonic characters. In fact, all  embryonic types seem to be more or less connecting, and conversely  connecting types, at least in Falceontology, are also embryonic. Now,  what I have said of the Sigillaria and Lepidodendron is equally true,  I believe, of other coal plants. I have taken these two because they  are better known ; but all that is known concerning other genera  seem to point in the same direction. They all seem to be more or less  connecting types. The Sphenophyllum, Noggerathia, and probably  many of the so-called Ferns of this period are of this character.  Let us inquire now what important conclusions may be drawn from  what we have seen of the affinities of these plants :  1. The distinction of plants into Cryptogams and Phcenogams is  considered by botanists a fundamental one. Many recent investiga-  tions, however, have combined to throw some doubt upon the entire  distinctness of these classes. The study of the Coal Plants, particu-  larly of the two families Sigillaria and Lepidodendron , it seems to me  entirely destroys this as a fundamental division, or, at least, as one at  all comparable to the great divisions of the animal kingdom. The  pines belong uaequivocally to the Phcenogams and the club-mosses to  the Cryptogams. If the Sigillaria and Lepidodendron are connecting  links between these two families then the classes to which they belong  can no longer be considered as fundamentally distinct types or plans  of structure. The study of animals, both existing and extinct, have  confirmed the wonderful generalization of Cuvier. The four types â€”  Vertebrata, Articidala, 3IoUusca, and Radiata â€” were as distinct during  the palaeozoic period as now. If such distinct plans of structure  exist in the vegetable kingdom at all they have not yet been indicated  as such by botanists. The distinction into exogen and endogen would  seem more likely to be fundamental, as this is apparently not a mere  distinction of rank or complexity of structure, but of plan of struc-  ture. If 80, then we shall probably be able to trace these two types  downwards until, overleaping the distinction of Phcenogams and  Cryptogams as one of complexity of structure only, they reach the  lower confines of the vegetable kingdom.  2. We have seen that the plants of the coal are most_, if not all of   164 LECTURES.  them, connecting types with embryonic characters. This is not an  isolated fact, hut one which meets us at every step in the course of our  study of the geologic history of the earth. It is hut one illustration  of a general latv, a law of the deepest philosophic import, and yet one  which is still very imperfectly recognized among geologists. The law  may he thus stated : The first introduced animals or plants of any  class have heen combining types, i. e., have united within themselves  the characters of several families, now distinct and even widely sepa-  rated. Thus the first vertebrates introduced were fishes, but not  typical fishes, as we might be led a priori to expect, but Placoids and  Ganoids, families which, particularly in their earlier lepresentatives,  united with ordinary fish characters others which connected them with  the class of reptiles, and even of mammals; and still others which  connect them with the embryonic condition of the typical fishes. It is  this combination of embryonic characters with others which connect  them with the higher classes, this union of high and low characters,  which has given rise to all the disj)ute concerning the position of these  families in the scale of Fishes as well as to much of the difi'erence of  opinion concerning the law of succession of animals in Greology.  Again, the first introduced reptiles, viz: the reptiles found in the old  red sandstone and coal, are the most remarkable instances of con-  necting types of which we have any knowledge. In the first place  they seem to have been amphibious, (in the proper sense of the word,)  and thus to have connected land animals and water animals, air  breathing with water breathing, and all of them united characters,  which are now represented by widely separated families. To give a  single instance : the carboniferous reptile, recently described by Pro-  fessor Wyman and exhibited at the last meeting of the Scientific As-  sociation at Albany, so remarkably combined characters which are now  parcelled out between the three families of Batrachians, Saurians, and  Ophidians, that this distinguished comparative anatomist seemed  almost at a loss as to which of these iamilies to assign it. He decided,  however, that it most nearly resembled a Salamandroid Batrachian  with characters closely connecting it with the other families already  mentioned.  The LahyrintJiodon of the new red sandstone has been classed by  some anatomists with Boiracliians, and by others with crocodiles.  There seems yet a doubt whether it should be called a tailless croco-  dile or a crawling frog with crocodilian teeth. The huge Saurians of  the secondary period combined reptilian with fish, and even some  mammalian characters. Even in the tertiary period and in the intro-  duction of the highest animals this law is not forgotten. The recent  investigations of Professor Owen have shown that the first introduced  Pachyderms were not typical Pachyderms, but that they combined the  characters of Pachyderms and Ruminants to such a degree that it is  almost impossible to assign them with certainty to one or the other  order. In fact, the study of these extinct forms has led this great  anatomist to class the Pachyderms and Ruminants together as sub-  divisions of one and the same order.  Thus in every case in the earliest faunas and florae one class stood  for many. The earliest families combined the characters of several   ox COAL. 165  families or classes, and stood as their representative until these fami-  lies or classes were separately introduced. The Placoids and Ganoids,  for instance, stood during almost the whole palfeozoic period the sole  representatives of the vertebrate type, combining in themselves the  characters of all classes, and thus prophesying their coming, until  Nature was fully prepared for their introduction. The Sigillaria and  Lepidodendron stood as the representatives of both Cryptogam and  Phoenogam, until these two ideas were separately and more distinctly  expressed by the subsequent introduction of the typical forms of these  two classes. It is as if Nature first sketched out her work in general  terms and then elaborated each subordinate idea in separate families ;  all these families, taken together as an organic whole, still containing  the original idea in a more completely developed form, as if the pro-  blem of organic nature was first expressed in a few simple but com-  prehensive symbols and then differentiated. Organic nature has  often been compared to a broken chain, the disjointed links of which  are the widely separated and distinctly marked families of tlie present  fauna and flora, and the connecting links of which are to be found  deep buried in the strata of the earth. But the complexity, the  beauty, and, more than all, the life, growth, and development of Na-  ture, is not to be represented by any such miserable mechanical con-  trivance as a chain. It is rather a tree â€” a tree of life â€” a tree whose  trunk is deeply rooted in the lowest paleozoic strata_, whose first  giant arms are given ofi\" in the carboniferous, which branch again in  the secondary and again in the tertiary periods, while its extreme  branchlets, and also its flower and fruit, are the fauna and flora of the  present epoch. The object of geology is to trace each branch to its  fellow branch, and each limb to its fellow limb, and thus gradually to  restore the whole noble form and determine the laws of its growth.  This differentiation, this passing from simplicity to complexity,  from unity through diversity to a higher unity, is the fundamental  law of development. Let me illustrate my meaning by a few simple  examples : Tbe ultimate anatomical elemeurs of every organized body,  whether animal or vegetable, are cells. The whole body is made up  of cells, and all the bodily functions are performed by cells. In fact,  the body may be looked upon as an organized community of indi-  vidual cells. Now, if we trace these cells from their earliest condition  in the embryo to their mature condition in the fully developed animal  or plant, or from the lowest animal or plant regularly to the top of  the scale, we will observe a most beautiful instance of the difteren-  tiation of which I speak. The cells are at first all alike, simple and  globular, and each performs all the functions appertaining to cells,  though comparatively imperfectly. But as development advances the  cells begin to take on different forms and to perform different func-  tions. Some become nervous cells, some muscular cells, some biliary  cells, &c., until, in the mature condition and in the highest animals,  the diversity of form and specialization of function reaches the highest  point, each form of cell being confined to the performance of a single  function.  If, instead of the ultimate anatomical elements, the cells, we take  the proximate anatomical elements, the organs, or even the regions of   166 LECTDEES.  the body, still the same differentiation of form and specialization of  iuction is observable as we pass from the embryonic to the mature  condition, or from the lowest to the highest animals. I might give  many other examples taken from the organic kingdom. I will give  bat one other example, and that taken from a still higher kingdom.  Human society is also an organized body, the ultimate anatomical  elements of which are individuals. Now, in the earliest conditions of  human society we find these elements, so far as their social functions  are concerned, identical. Each man performs all the social functions  apertaining to man. He is his own tailor, shoemaker, agriculturist,  scientific man, &c. But in proportion as society advances in the same  proportion does specialization of social functions advance, until, if we  could conceive of a society perfectly organized on a purely material  basis, i. e. according to the French material philosophy, then the  social function of each individual would be reduced to the narrowest  possible limits. This is only impossible or undesirable on account of  man's moral and spiritual nature. Still it is no less evident that, in  f-o far as human society is a material organization, specialization of  lunction, differentiation is the law of development.  Now, it will be recollected that in the geological history of animals  and plants we have everywhere found the same differentiation of form  and specialization of function. As in the history of the animal body,  one cell form in the embryo was the representative of many widely  separated cell forms in the mature animal ; so also in the geological  liistory of that greater and more complex organism, the animal and  vegetable kingdom, one form in the early periods stood as the repre-  sentative of many widely separated forms in its present mature con-  dition. Am I not justified, then, in saying that the great law which  has governed the introduction of successive animal and vegetable spe-  cies is that of gradual development of the animal and vegetable king-  dom as an organic luliolef  It seems to me that all the dispute and misunderstanding on this  subject have been the result of too narrow a view, have arisen from fixing  the mind upon genera and species instead of upon the larger divisions  of classes and orders, upon the individual elements instead of the  organic whole. Development does not necessarily involve the idea of  ])rogression in all the individual elements. In the differentiation of  the cells of the living body, of the individuals of an advancing com-  munity, or of the forms of an advancing fauna, the whole organism  progresses, but as a necessary result of differentiation, while the high-  est individuals are successively higher and higher, the lowest, consid-  ered in themselves, and not as parts of an organized whole, may  hecome loiver. Certainly the difference between the high and the low  becomes constantly greater. It should not surj^rise us, then, that  f^ome of the lowest torms of animal life have been among the latest  introduced. It is precisely what, according to a true appreciation of  the law of development, we should be naturally led to expect.  Mr. Plugh Miller, the eminent Scotch geologist, in his admirable  work, \" Footprints of the Creator,\" by taking too limited a view of  this subject_, has been led, if not into error, at least into a statement  of views which has misled many. In his zeal against the Lamarck-   ON COAL. 167  ian theorists, and more particularly against the author of the \"Ves-  tiges of Creation,\" he has attempted to show that, in certain families,  at least, the law has heen that of degradation, instead of progression.  He has labored to prove that the earliest fishes have been the highest,  instead of the lowest fishes, and that the earliest reptiles have been  higher in the scale than the present reptiles. This idea has been  seized upon by some in this country, and it has been attempted, by  connecting it with the fall and degradation of man, to show that the  universallaw of history, both geological and human, is degradation.  The disciples of this melancholy philosophy believe that divine power  successively introduced higher and higher classes, but each class, left  to its own laws, continued to degrade itself. The Deity repeatedly  attempted progression, by the miraculous introduction of successively  higher classes, but some malign influence as constantly iaterposed  and, to some extent, frustrated these attempts.  Now, it is evident that these theorizers have never thoroughly  grasped the fundamental idea of development. They mistake speciali-  zation for degradation. Upon this theory all our boasted modern  civilization, so far as it is the result of division of labor, specialization  of social functions, and mutual dependence of parts, is degradation.  Upon what ground are the Ganoids and Flacoids considered the  highest fishes? Only on the ground that they combine with their  fish characters others which ally them with the higher classes, par-  ticularly with reptiles. In other words, they fall into the very error  of the Laraarckians themselves, viz : that of supposing that the ani-  mal kingdom is to be represented by a linear series, and that, there-  fore, the highest fishes approach the lowest reptiles, and the highest  reptiles the next higher class, &c. But the very reverse of this is the  fact. The animal kingdom should be represented by an infinitely  branching tree, rather than by an ascending right line ; tor we find,  in every case, classes approach each other in the lowest members of  each, and diverge as they ascend. Thus, it is the lowest, and not the  highest plants, which approach the animal kingdom. As we ascend,  they become more and more widely separated, until, in the highest  representatives of each, the separation reaches its highest point. So  also each branch of these kingdoms diverges from its fellow branches.  It is, therefore, in its lowest, not its highest, members that we should  naturally expect, according to the law of difierentiation, the class of  fishes to approach the class of reptiles. In some sense, indeed, Fla-  coids and Ganoids may be considered higher than typical fishes.  Their brain and nervous system is more highly organized, their re-  production is more complex, their young are better cared for. But  it will be recollected that they are both connecting and embryonic  types. Now, it is their connecting characters which seem to elevate  them, for their true fish characters are all embryonic. As vertebrates  they may possibly be considered higher than other fishes, but as  fishes they must be considered low. Anatomists may place them  high but morphologists will always place them low. If the several  classes of the animal kingdom, diverging in various directions, be,  as it were, projected u|)on a vertical plane, the Flacoids and Ganoids  may possibly occupy a higher position than the typical fishes ; but_,   168 LECTUEES.  in such a rectilinear projection, all the variety and beauty of nature  is lost. It is evident that, for purposes of classification, the mor-  phologist is right ; for if the principle of the anatomists is consistently  carried out, no classification is possible, for animals the most diverse,  an echinoderm and a fish, may be brought together. The Divine classi-  fier, in the introduction of species, has followed the principle of the  morphologist.  Geology, then, teaches, and, as it seems to me, unmistakably  teaches, that the law of succession of animals and plants is that of  progressive development in time of these two kingdoms. But,  although there has been a development, it is not the development of  the Lamarckian, of the author of the Vestiges of Creation, and the  pantheist. The development which geology teaches is not a develop-  ment which is the result of physical laws and physical forces. If  there is anything which geology teaches with clearness, it is that  the animal and vegetable kingdoms did not commence as monads, or  vital points, but as organisms so perfect that even the maddest La-  marckian must admit that they could not have been formed by agency  of physical forces ; that species did not pass into one another hy trans-  mutation, but that each species was introduced in full perfection, re-  mained unchanged during the term of their existence, and died in  full perfection ; that physical conditions cannot change one species  into another, but that a species will give up its life rather than its  specific character. In passing from the equator to the poles we pass  from one geographical fauna to another, from one set of species to  another, but observe no transmutation, but only substitutions ; so  also in passing from the oldest geological to the present fauna we  pass from one set of species to another ; not, however, by transmuta-  tion, but always by substitution. This has been repeated so many  thousand times in the geological history of the earth that there is  no room for doubt on the subject. As far as the evidence of geology  extends, each species ivas introduced hy the direct miraculous interfer-  ence of a personal intelligence. There has, indeed, been a constantly  increasing series, but the connexion between the terms of the series  has not been physical or genetic, but intellectual ; not founded in the  laws of reproduction, but in the eternal counsels of the Almighty.  There has, indeed, been a development, but not a development the  force of which exists within the thing developing ; but rather the de-  velopment of a great work of art, under the hand of the Divine  Artist â€” a work conceived in eternity, and elaborated throughout all  time. What an overwhelming idea this thought gives us of the un-  changeableness, the all-comprehensive intelligence and foreknowledge  of the Deity ! The infinite diversity of nature, the whole idea of this  infinite work of art, was contained in the first strokes of the Great  Artist's pencil, and the ceaseless activity of Deity has been exercised  only in the eternal unfolding of the original conception.   LECTURE ON THE VASTNESS OF THE VISIBLE CREATION.  BY PROFESSOR STEPHEN ALEXANDER OF THE COLLEGEj OF NEW JERSEY.  My object on this occasion is, in itself, a very simple one. I desire to  give some illustrations of the vastness of the visible creation, as made  known by modern astronomy. I say emphatically modern astroDomy,  for some knowledge of this science is probably nearly as old as  the world itself. Almost from the first issuing of the great decree  that the sun and moon should serve for signs, and for seasons, and for  days, and for years, men have been careful to observe the heavens ;  for the Great Creator had so written that decree upon the heavens  themselves that men have not been slow to read the lesson thus visi-  bly inculcated, I would observe, moreover, that the objects of astro-  nomical research, with very trifling exceptions, are, of all others, with  which we have to do, the most unalterable. It is almost exactly true  that the very constellations which we now see were gazed upon by the  antedeluvian patriarchs ; were in full view of Noah when the great  flood of waters was upon the earth ; met the upturned eye of Abraham  when he was led out by Divine command to behold in them the sym-  bol of the promise ; guided the ancient Greeks in navigation, and  still serve the modern astronomer as so many guide-points in the  heavens.  My purpose, as already indicated, is to illustrate, not to demonstrate.  To accomplish the latter in a single lecture would not be practicable ;  and certainly of astronomy, above all other sciences, it is true that it  may throw itself on its character for veracity when it requests that its  conclusions should be received as reliable. A science which can trace  a comet in its course, where no eye has had even a telescopic view of  it for three-quarters of a century, and bring it back by computation  correctly almost to a day, or which can predict an eclipse a century  hence as readily as one that will occur this year, and to whose accu-  racy experience throughout bears such abundant testimony â€” such a  science may fearlessly throw itself on its character for veracity. Be-  fore I proceed, however, to elucidate the subject, let me call attention  for a moment to an old-fashioned problem, whose bearings upon the  subject will, I trust, be presently seen. I allude to the problem of the  price of a horse, in which a farthing was allowed for the first nail in his  shoes, two for the second, four for the third, and so on. There were  thirty-two nails in all, and yet, from the small beginning of a farthing,  owing to this doubling thirty-one times, the value of the horse was only  to be computed in millions of pounds. Now, with reference to the  subject of astronomy, we shall have occasion to see that, though com-  mencing with a comparatively moderate unit, we shall advance upon  a similar plan, but much more rapidly. Keeping, then, in view the  illustration already given, you will at once see how gigantic, after a  very few steps, must be the last result compared with the first. Our  first object to-night will be to gain some idea of the size of the earth  itself, on which we stand. The half diameter of the earth is the   170 LECTURES.  measuring unit with wliicli to conapare the distance of the earth from  the sun, and thus obtain a new unit with which afterwards to compare  the distances of the other planets. To give a just idea of the size of  the earth we will avail ourselves of the largest tangible measure at-  tainable, that is, the highest mountain on the earth's surface. The  highest mountains are the Himalayas, their altitude being five and  a half miles. Now, we do not exaggerate when we say that, if we  could uncover the base of one of those mountains, it would cover four  times the original area of the District of Columtjia, or the surface of  one of the ordinary counties of our States, rising above that surface  to the height of five and a half miles, about equal to the height of  Chimborazo added to that of the highest of the Alps. This shall be  our standard of comparison with regard to the magnitude of the earth.  Such a mountain is rather more than Y^io\" <^^ ^^^ earth's diameter or  about y\\-o of its radius. In making the comparison, after the ordi-  nary mode, two difficulties present themselves. It is said that, if you  represent the earth by a globe, the highest mountain on its sur-  face may be represented by a small grain of sand. You thus proceed  from the greater to the less^ whereas, in nature, we must proceed from  the less to the greater. Besides, a grain of sand is too small to give  an adequate idea of the matter to be illustrated. To avoid this we  shall make use of a scale sufiiciently large to present the mountain  distinctly, and shall proceed in the natural order from the less to the  greater. This diagram before me is thirty-nine feet six inches in  length, and is intended to represent two radii of the earth opening to  the extent of one degree. At the further end of it is a blue band,  representing the atmosphere, and immediately beneath which is a  small row of mountains. Their heights, on this scale, is a trifle less  than two-thirds of an inch, and their actual height, as compared with  the real half diameter of the earth, is as two-thirds of an inch com-  pared with thirty-nine and a half feet, and doubling the half diameter  we shall have the ratio of two-thirds of an inch to seventy-nine feet.  Below the row of mountains you have a dark blue band, representing  the ocean. Below that again a darker portion still, representing that  portion of the earth's crust through which you must go to find a red  heat, and beyond that you have the red color continued until it passes  into whiteness ; it indicates the depth at which we would probably  arrive at a white heat.  [It would be impossible, in a wood-cut, to do justice to the illustra-  tion here explained by the lecturer. The explanation itself will  doubtless be sufficient.]  The diameter of the earth is, then, a very large unit in comparison  with the height of the highest mountain. The circumference, of  course, is more than three times the diameter. If you should attempt  to walk around the earth at the rate of twenty miles a day, three  years and five months would be spent in completing the circuit; and if  you should fly around it at the rate at which the steam car travels, say  thirty miles an hour, you would accomplish its circuit in thirty-four and  a half days ; but, if its circumference be great in comparison with ordi-  nary standards, its surface in comparison with that of a sphere of  ordinary size must be still more enormous. The illustrations, I would   THE VISIBLE CREATION. 171  remark, that I give you here, are most of them originally devised, and  the results in all cases verified hy actual computation. We could not  pass over the surface of the earth and take a good look at the surface  at a more rapid rate than that of twenty square miles a day, and yet  this would occupy us a period of 27,090 years. To view that portion  of the earth which is inhabited, if we should estimate it at but one-  fourth of the whole, would, at the same rate of progress, require 6,750  years ; or to view the habitable portion of the surface of the earth would  require, in the case of the same individual, provided he could live so  long, more than the time from the creation of man down to the present  day to walk. If the surface of the earth be so large, its capacity, of  course^ compared with an ordinary standard, will be found to be to it  in a still greater ratio. The largest tangible measure, as I have said,  is the largest mountain on the earth's surface. Suppose such a moun-  tain to be regularly shaped, and to have a diameter of twenty miles at  the base, it would then contain 576 cubic or solid miles of material.  Make use of that huge body as the unit of measurement of the bulk of  the earth, and the bulk of the earth would contain it 450,000,000 of  times, and even more. How can we appreciate so large a number?  We find it even difficult to form an idea how large a number a mil-  lion is ; we may obtain some idea of the vastness of numbers, such as  those in quf^stion, by ascertaining the time required to count them.  If, then, you should count at the rate of two per second, continuing the  work for eight hours a day, twenty-one years and five months would be  spent in counting the number which expresses the bulk of the earth  in comparison with that of the mountain. Perhaps I do not exag-  gerate the matter when I say, that the most accurate idea of a bulk so  vast may be obtained by regarding the image which we frame to our-  selves when we attempt to form an idea of infinite space. As we  cannot grasp infinity this image must have a dim and misty outline ;  but it may be that it approaches more nearly than anything else to  presenting an adequate idea of the actual size of the earth.  Having obtained some idea of the size of the earth let us proceed a step  further, not in the way of doubling, but much faster. In so doing we  next notice the distance of the earth from the moon, which is represented  here on a much smaller scale than that employed in our first figure.  The distance from the centre of the earth to the centre of the moon is  about sixty radii, or thirty diameters of the earth. The magnificent  appendage of Saturn compares very well in size with this, its diame-  ter being about twenty times that of the earth. We pass from this to  the diameter of the sun, which is about one hundred and twelve times  that of the earth, and, of course, the surface is more than ten thou-  sand times the surface of the earth. The scale we have at first adopted  we should find to be inadequate to compare the earth with the sun.  No ordinary apartment could contain the necessary illustration. The  scale has therefore been reduced a thousand times, instead of being  that of a hundred miles to a foot. This diagram is constituted on a  scale of 100,000 miles to a foot. On it the earth has shrunk down to  3^0*0 of an inch in diameter. This, then, [pointing to the figure,] is  the relative size of the sun, 112 diameters of the earth being equal to  tbe diameter of the sun. The liveliest imagination^ however exer-   172   LECTURES.   cised, can form no adequate idea of the size of this magnificent luminary  of the day. Its surface occupies an area greater than that of twice ten  thousand oceans, each larger than the Pacific. And this surface is  tossed into waves of intense brilliancy, beneath which the Himalayas  would be buried and \"melt with fervent heat;\" and whether we  regard him as issuing from the chambers of the east, he commences  like a giant to run his course ; or whether in unveiled meridian splen-  dor, he almost seems to pause a moment to gaze upon a world rejoicing  in his presence, or enwrapped in robes of surpassing magnificence he  sinks to rest at night ; under any and all these points of view, he is  at once the fitting representative and chosen emblem of all that is  good and beautiful.  From the size of the sun we proceed, in the next place, to that of  the diameter of the earth's orbit. But I would observe, in passing,  that the relative size of most of the planets is represented in this  diagram. Thus, we have that of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,  Saturn, &c. The moon is represented by a ball, the size of a pea, at    Upper line â€” 1. Mercury. 2. Venus. 3. Earth. 4. Mars. 5. Moon. 6. Jupiter.  Lower line â€” 7. Saturn and the three largest of his satellites. 8. Uranus, with the two  large satellites. 9. Neptune, with his satellites.  the place to which I now point, almost touching the sun. That rep-  resents the comparative size of the moon. The distance from the  centre to the surface of the sun is one and two-thirds the distance of  the moon from the earth, which itself is thirty diameters of the earth.   THE VISIBLE CREATION. 173  The distance of tlie earth from the sun is about 12,000 diameters  of the earth, or, if we proceed in the other way, multiplying the  last unit, we shall find it to be 107 diameters of the sun, vast as is  that body in extent. To travel this distance at the rate of thirty  miles an hour, going on continually, would occupy three hundred  and sixty two years and seven months ; and merely to count it at  at the rate already mentioned, that of two per second for eight  hours of every day, would fully occupy four and a half years ;  and yet more than three times this distance the earth travels every  year. To turn around but once in a year requires but a very slow  angular motion. Imagine the hand of a dial-plate to turn around  only once in a year, how large the dial-plate must be in order that we  might see the motion at all ; yet in completing its circuit the earth  travels at the rate of nineteen miles per second ; or, while I de-  liberately say to you, it moves, we are borne nineteen miles. This  result cannot be in error by more than its two hundred and thirty-  pecond part. When nearest to the sun, which is about the last of  December, we travel about three-tenths of a mile per second faster  than this, and about the first of July three-tenths of a mile slower.  Even this excess of velocity is fearful. Who could think of being  conveyed, mechanically, over the surface of the earth at the rate of  three-tenths of a mile per second.  We are now compelled again to reduce our scale, and, instead of one,  one hundred thousand miles to the foot, make use of one, two hundred  millions of miles to a foot; and thus the sun, though magnificent in  comparison with the earth, shrinks down and becomes no larger  than the head of a pin. The orbit of the earth is represented by a  white curve, to which the rod now points. Here we have the dis-  turbed regions of the smaller planets, and there we have portions of  that of Uranus and the most remote of the known planets, Neptune.  This long and complete curve is the orbit of Halley's comet. ^ The  distance of the earth from the sun being now taken as our unit, the  distance of Neptune will be thirty times that, or thirty times ninety-  five million miles. Of course, to travel it at thirty miles per day  continuously would occupy about ten thousand eight hundred and  seventy-five years. Five distances of the earth from the sun from  the place of Neptune would carry you to the end of the orbit of Hal-  ley's comet. The distance from this, again, to the nearest star is, we  had almost said, a void of immense extent compared, with that  which we have already had to do. It is scarcely worth while to re-  gard miles at all in speaking of the distance of a star ; the number  becomes so large that we cannot grasp it. We may, however^ obtain  a speaking illustration of the enormous distance of the nearest of the  fixed stars by ascertaining what must represent it in comparison with  the small globe which I hold in my hand, which has a diameter of  three inches. We must despair any more of illustrating distances so  vast by any picture, however large. We are not about to deal in mag-  nificent oriental fiction, but with ascertained facts. Let this globe rep-  resent the earth ; then one hundred and seventeen thousand five hun-  dred miles will represent the distance of the nearest fixed star.  It is useless, almost^ to state how long it would take to count   174 LECTURES.  this distance â€” one hundred and seventeen thousand years would  thus be occupied ; and, if you thought of travelling it at all, you  would find that it could not he accomplished in seventy-four mil-  lions of years. Having thus ascended where the nearest of the  fixed stars are, let us, in the next place, ascertain wha,t they are â€”  whether planets or suns, or what ? We all know with how much  facility we see a bright light, though it may be very small. A can-  dle or taper can be seen in foggy weather long before the building  containing it ; and even in the case of reflected light, the merest  spicula of glass, how brightly it shines, and how readily it can be dis-  tinguished from the dark substances surrounding it. The light of a  star must be very intense, for even when highly magnified by a  telescope, so that its light is enfeebled, it yet shines brightly, though  appearing nearly as a mere point ; and if the light of it is reflected  light why do we not see the body that illuminates the star ? What  is that body ? It cannot be the sun, because, even at the very moderate  distance of the planets, it becomes very feeble ; if, then, we could  suppose the light coming from the stars to be reflected lights we  would be at a loss to discover the luminous body that shines upon  them. But it has been ascertained, by careful experiment, that the  light of the very brightest fixed star, Sirius or the Dog star, which,  if the nigiit were clear, my audience might see as they passed out of  the lecture room â€” we say it has been ascertained that the actual light  emitted by this star, (with quite a probable allowance for distance,)  is full sixty-three times that of our sun ; such is not always the  case, as some stars do not give quite as much light as the sun. But  it is true, notwithstanding, that if many of the stars are not suns they  are more. It is unnecessary to contend about the name, for you must  either call them suns or invent a name which shall inean a larger  thing. When we make the statement that all the fixed stars are suns,  are we aware of the sublimity involved in that statement ? I under-  took to show my audience, as well as I could, a short time ago, what  constituted a single sun ; but it is also true that the tiny ray which  gladdens our eye, as shooting from some twinkling star, it trembles in  the casement ; it is true that this is a miniature sunbeam, and the  faint and feeble glow of starlight, which sometimes, like a semi-  transparent veil, covers the fair face of nature is woven of the  scattered glory of thousands of suns. In the very fact that it is thus  but faint and feeble we have the most speaking illustration of their  awful distance ; when we arrive at such a distance as this, it becomes  quite evident that such a unit as the earth's distance from the sun is  altogether too small. The distance of the earth from the sun must be  taken some 500,000 times or more, in order to make a comparison, and  we must therefore resort to something that will give us an adequate  measuring unit. This may be found in the velocity of progression of  the light which comes from the stars themselves. According to two  different and independent results this velocity is about 192,000 miles  per second ; the distance of the earth from the sun will thus be repre-  sented by 85 minutes. It takes a very trifle more than that for  light to pass from the sun to the earth. The Ifght comes from a  Centauri, the nearest of the fixed stars, in 3| years ; from 61 in the   THE VISIBLE CREATION. 175  Swan in 9^ years ; from Arcturus in 26 years ; from the Polar star in  48 years ; and from Capella in 70f years ; or Capella, the beautiful star  in the Goat, is seen by the light which left it nearly three-quarters of  a century ago, and has been travelling at the rate of one hundred  and ninety-two thousand miles per second during the whole of that  interval.  Let us next notice the combinations of the stars. It is a very  curious circumstance, to say the least, that wherever we direct the  telescope to the heavens we shall find the stars combined in pairs ;  and so frequently does this combination occur that we cannot regard  it as the result of accidental position. It is true that when two stars  are almost one behind the other they might not appear to be very far  apart, though really at very different distances from us ; but by careful  measurement, in some cases, it has been ascertained that they are  really, as well as apparently, near. In fact they are connected to-  gether, and revolve around each other, as is the case with the earth  and sun. We have here represented two or three such double stars.  Tnere is one in Gemini ; also one in Scorpio, one of the two stars  being blue and the other yellow. The blue star does not show well,  unless in a very good light ; but the representation is therefore the  more true to nature, the sky being itself so blue that it is more diffi-  cult to see such a star. Red and yellow stars are also of frequent  occurrence ; and in the case of the beautiful star in Andromeda, the  two individual stars are, the one rose color, and the other green ; the  colors of the double stars are complementary, or such as, when com-  bined together, form a white light, the star appearing white and  single to the bare eye. We can perceive something extremely elegant  in the arrangement if planets should circulate around these red or  green suns ; then a red or a green light would be seen as long as it  alone were visible ; but a white light, when both suns were above the  horizon, poetic fancy never sketched anything more sublimely elegant  than this combination of tinted suns, these parti-colored gems which  sparkle in the diadem which surrounds the dark brow of night.  We come now to a more extensive combination of stars. We cannot  look at the sky with any sort of attention even once without perceiving  an amazing collection of the stars in the direction of one singla great  band or girdle. This constitutes what is called the milky way.  Throughout one half of its circuit it is divided into at least two parts.  Most of the stars in heaven are situated in one part, and in the other  portions of the sky the stars are comparatively sparse. The attempt  was made by Sir William Herschel to ascertain the relative distance  of the fixed stars before the actual distance of any of them was deter-  mined. Some idea may be formed of this by ascertaining how many  more can be seen in one direction rather than another, as we might  judge of the extent of a crowded audience in one direction rather than  in another, by ascertaining how many could be seen in the one and in  the other direction. A better method of sounding the heavens, as it was  called, consisted in using successively telescopes of greater and greater  space-penetrating power. The space-penetrating power may be ascer-  tained by comparing the brightness of the beam of light emitted by a  telescope with that seen by the bare eye. The science of optics will  readily enable us to ascertain that. Then, if we bear in mind that light   176 LECTURES.  at twice tlie distance is four times as feeble, &c., it will be seen tliat a  telescope which would increase the intensity of light to four times that of  the light seen by the bare eye might enable us to see twice as far, &c.  By making use of a telescope of a greater and greater space-pene-  trating power Sir William Herschel, in investigating portions of the  milky way, continued to see new stars up to the twenty-eighth  order of distance. The borders of the milky way are supposed to  be at the nine hundredth order of distance. If this be so the  time of the arrival of light from the borders of the milky way must  not be measured by a single year, but by centuries ; in fact, so far as  we may rely on the conclusions of Dr. Madler, the distance of the  centre of this our group from us, as thus estimated, is 537 years. He  concludes, moreover, that the stars in the milky way and our sun  with them revolve at the rate of once in about eighteen million years.  \"Whether we regard this as accurately ascertained or not, very certain  it is that the sun and ell planets are moving in the regions of space.  The researches of Herschel, Argelander, Struve, and others, have  all contributed to point out very accurately a single spot in the heav-  ens, towaids which we are incessantly travelling by a motion very  slow when we consider the magnitude of the orbit, the distance trav-  elled being about four-fifths of the diameter of the earth's orbit every  year. When we scrutinize the outskirts of the milky way and at-  tempt to see beyond it, we find what seems to be an entirely detached  combination of stars. If what we see in them be stars only about the  size of those in the milky way we might readily conclude that they  were at no greater distance ; but it may be that what are apparently  single stars are themselves combinations. These groups are called  clusters. This is the representation of a coarse cluster. We find others  much more closely arranged, as in the figure, where they are repre-  sented by a white, powdery substance. The stars near the centre are  not to be counted by hundreds. When clusters become so remote that  you cannot make out the individual stars you may still discern clus-  ters of a granular shape and appearance in their structure ; or that  they are made up of a \"star dust,\" an expression sublime from  its very simplicity. In this quasi crystalline mass the molecules are  double stars, the ultimate particles are suns, and the atoms, if any,  are planets. If the cluster be a globular one it may also be true that  all the stars, the outer ones only excepted, are revolving around the  centre in the self-same time. Beyond these still are the nebulaB, some  of which the most powerful telescopes have failed to resolve; that is,  have i'ailed to show that they are made up of stars. In other cases  they are found to be made up of stars, and resolvable. We cannot  positively assert that there is no cloudy-looking substance existing  in the heavens which is not made up in this way ; some appear-  ances, surrounding stars, cannot as yet be resolved. Other whole  nebula3 cannot yet be resolved by telescopes of large space-penetrating  power. Some idea of the distance of a nebula not resolvable may be  obtained by ascertaining the space-penetrating power which will cause  that nebula to present the appearance put on by another before power  suflScient was applied to resolve it; and thus, comparing the powers  employed in the two cases, we arrive at a distance so great as that a  comparison by means of the velocity of light itself becomes almost   THE VISIBLE CEEA.TION. 177  inadequate. Even liglit, (which could we thus curb its motion would  girdle the earth in a twinkling,) which rebounds to us from the moon  in a second and a quarter, and which, springing from its home in the  sun, visits the most distant of the known planets and returns in  less than a day, even this swiftly flying messenger, borne upon the  very wings of the morning, can only reach us from those remote  bounds after the lapse of centuries. Admitting all this to be true,  then, although an accurate result is here no longer possible, there is  a reasonable probability that the sublime idea presented by Huygens  is itself a fact; that some of these bodies are so remote that the light  by which we see them must have left them before the creation of man.  There is something almost awful in the thought of our having arrived  at a reasonable probability that we see these objects as they were be-  fore the race of man had being ; to behold, as it were, the record of  eternity past, unrolled to be read in time. We are compelled to view  them from such a distance looking towards them; but in imagination  we may place ourselves at the other extremity of the line thus defined,  then the light from the earth and solar system would have been as  long in reaching that position as the light from the other way has been  in reaching us ; and if we had the optical power and could look down  upon the earthy then the mastodon, which is now a mere fossil in our  cabinets, would be seen as the living, moving^ breathing mastodon.  The I'act, in more general terms, is this: There are portions of the uni-  verse through which the visible record of very much that is great  and awful that has been transacted here is still travelling through the  regions of space^ and might be discerned by a being provided with  sufficient optical power. I think it necessary to notice but one thing  more. The fixed stars are not merely like the sun in the intensity of  their light, but, it would also seem, in revolving around their axes.  We ascertain that the sun revolves around its axis by noticing the  spots on its surface. When there are many spots towards us the light  of the sun must be enfeebled, sometimes even sensibly so. There are  variable stars that periodically become dim and then again resume  their former brightness. The natural solution of this fact is that these  stars are like the sun, not merely in their light, but also in the way in  which that light is produced. Perhaps upon their surface there are  spots which, when turned towards us, cause their light to become dim,  and when away from us there is an increase of brightness. There are  stars also which may be called temporary stars ; for after appearing  in the heavens a brief period they become seemingly very small or they  disappear altogether, a fact which can hardly well be accounted for,  except by the supposition that there has been a real physical change  in the body itself. In undergoing these changes, changes in color have  also been manifest, so great that we may suppose that there has been  a combustion or partial destruction of the body in question. The star  seen by Anshelm in 1670 was of the third magnitude, passed through  great fluctuations of light for two years, and then became either ex-  cessively small or quite invisible. There are, moreover, lost stars,  whose places are now vacant, though some cf them have been recently  observed. When we look at these strange fluctuations we may sup-  pose that something like combustion has taken place^ or that, for the  12 s   178 LECTURES.  time being, its power of giving light has been suspended. In reviewing  these facts it appears difficult not to conclude that here was a world  whose destiny was, for the time being, completed, and the fitful glare  of whose gorgeous funeral pile shooting across almost the vast distance  which separates us came with undiminished velocity to tell us the tale  that once it was. However this may be, we certainly know that He  who, ''by His strength, setteth fast the mountains, being girded  with power,\" hath also *' of old laid the foundation of the earth, and  the heavens are the work of his hands. They shall perish but He shall  endure ; yea, all of them shall wax old, like a garment, and as a ves-  ture shall He change them, and they shall be changed ; but He is the  same and his years shall have no end;\" for \" He inhabiteth eternity  and the praises thereof.\"   METEOROLOGY.   COMMUNICATION FROM A. FENDLER.  COLONIA TOVAR, VENEZUELA, SoUTH AMERICA,  August 5, 1856.  Dear Sir : I sailed from Philadelphia on the 5th of May, and  arrived at Laguayra three weeks after. Colonia Tovar I reached on  the 7th of June, and commenced my meteorological observations on  the 10th. The barometer and the dry and wet bulb thermometers,  which by your kindness I received from Mr. Green, I have brought  home safe and in good order.  Accompanying this I send you two registers of meteorological ob-  servations of the month of June and July, 1856 ; and here I have to  make the following remarks :  1. As I am very much interested in the results of the observations,  I need not say that I pay the most particular care and attention to  the condition of the instruments, as well as to the nicety in taking  observations and in noting them down.  2. The column under the head of \" Barometer height reduced to  freezing point/' I could not fill up for want of the necessary tables.  3. By comparing my old thermometer, which is one of the more  common kinds, marked \" T. Barry, London,\" with the Smithsonian  dry bulb thermometer, I found that the former is from one and a half  to five degrees too high ; so that I was obliged to use the dry bulb of  the psychrometer also as thermometer in the open air. The wet bulb  was therefore exposed to the open air also. According to the first  principles of evaporation it is, however, evident that the more rapid  the motion of air is which touches the wet bulb the more energetic  will be the evaporation of the water contained in the wet linen, and  the lower will the mercury sink. This I found to be confirmed by  every breeze, and even the ligtitest breath of wind that happened to  strike the wet bulb at the time I took observations. I therefore regard  all observations with the psychrometer, that are not taken in a calm  atmosphere, or in an atmosphere the velocity of which at the time of  observation is known, as of little value.  As I had no other standard thermometer besides the dry and wet  bulb, I can give the psychrometrical observations only, with the re-  mark that they are worth just as much as all other such observations  made in the open air without regard to the currents of the atmo-  sphere. In future I shall try to shelter the wet bulb against the  influence of wind at the time of observation,  4. As I have no rain gage I can only put down the time of be-  ginning and ending of rain.  5. With regard to clouds I may say, that the higher clovids are  mostly hidden from view by the masses of lower clouds, so that the  course of the former can very seldom be ascertained in the rainy  season, and, when seen, there are several strata, one above the other.  Instead of the higher clouds, I have carefully noticed and put down   180 METEOROLOGY.  the course of the loiver clouds, under the head of \"winds.\" The  motion of these lower clouds may justly be said to indicate the real  course of the wind ; for in such a mountainous country as this the  atmosphere at the bottom of the kettle-shaped valley of the colony,  is set in motion by a great number of local causes, and this motion  is changed and modified by the many ravines and watercourses, and  by every slope of the irregularly shaped mountains. The colony is  surrounded by mountain ridges, crowned by several peaks. These  barriers open only in one direction, towards the east, where they form  an outlet for the river Tuy, which has its sources in the neighboring  fields and adjacent forests. In such a region as this it is next to im-  possible to note, even in one narrow district, all the diiferent little  breaths and jerks of wind, which frequently change every moment.  As to the motion ot the lower clouds, they frequently showed a  velocity which I estimated at about 7 miles per hour ; and as there is  no number corresponding to this velocity in the tables, I introduced  the number \" 2^,\" which means 7 miles per hour.  Fog is a considerable item in this region in the rainy season, and I  have accordingly noted it down under the head of \" kinds of clouds.\"  Thunder and lightning are very rare here, and when they occur  they make so little show that, with regard to force, they may be com-  pared to those of the United States as the zephyr to a strong gale.  In the register I have noted them down in the margin.  Tornadoes I have never seen in thecolony_, not even a gale of wind,  within the two and a half years that I have been living here. Hail  storms are unknown in this part of the country.  Of the 48 observations recorded in July, at 7 a. m. and 2 p. m., on  the course of the lower clouds, 10 are E., 15 E.SE., and 15 8E., which  shows the prevailing winds to be between E. and SE. Their mean  velocity is a fraction over four miles per hour.  Of rain, fog, mist, and clouds, we had more than a sufficiency, the  mean cloudiness being 6.4.  The weather has been so unfavorable since my return from the  States that I have not yet measured any of the neighboring heights  and passes by barometer.  The thermometer in the open air shows a mean temperature of 58.3  for the month of July, a rather low temperature for the height of  6,500 feet in latitude 10Â° 26'. The minimum of the month was 54Â°,  the maximum 69Â°.  I also inclose the half-hourly and hourly barometrical observations  for seven days, made in order to ascertain the hour of maximum and  minimum of the daily periodical variations. And here I found that  these variations within the tropics, at least at the colony, are not so  regular as we sometimes find stated in books. As, for instance, the  following: \"Such is the regularity with which these motions are  efiected within the equatorial zones that they might there serve to  give the true time of the day.\" â€” (Nicollet, Essay on Meteor. Observ.,  page 7.) Eor we find maximums at 9^ a. m., 10, 11, 12 m., and  minimums at 4 p. m., 4^, 5, 5^, 6^ 6|, 7, and all this within the short  period of seven days. This irregularity is the more remarkable, as the  colony is a place where none of the extremes of heat and cold, or of   METEOROLOGY. 181  gales, hurricanes, and thunder storms are felt, that could disturb the  equilibrium of the atmosphere.  Besides the two registers and the hourly observations, I have copied  for you and inclosed the thermometrical observations for 12 months in  1854 and 1855. These have been taken with my old thermometer,  which proves to be from 1^ to 5 degrees too high, as compared with  the Smithsonian thermometer. Although this would make the mean  temperature of the year about 3 degrees too high, we are still enabled  to make some comparisons between the different months, which show  that from August the mean monthly temperature is gradually sinking  till January, which is the coldest month. After January it rises  again till May, and then sinks till July. This seems to inlicate that  the rising and falling of the mean temperature keeps equal pace with  the declination of the sun. If we now compare the means of the dif-  ferent hours of the day of each month, we find that the highest tem-  perature of the day is not at 2 or 8 p. m., as in the United States, but  at 12 o'clock at noon, and that the temperature at 3 p. m. is but a  fraction greater than that at 9 a. m. In five months of the year it is  nearly or quite the same with that at 9 a. m., viz: from November  till March, inclusive; during the other part of the year, from May  till September, inclusive, the mean temperature is higher at 3 p. m.  than at 9 a. m., with the exception of October and April, where the  temperature at 3 is even lower than that at 9 ; and these are the two  months which follow immediately after the equinoxes. Another curi-  ous fact is the sudden rise of mean temperature from July to August.  In Santa Fe de Bogota, in 4Â° 35' north latitude, July is said to be  even the coldest month of the year.  Some other facts could, no doubt, be drawn from this register by com-  parison, if its observations were founded upon a standard thermometer.  On the last page of this register of Colonia Tovar you will find  some observations, taken with the same thermometer, of \"'Barry,\"  during my stay at Chagres, on the Isthmus of Panama.  During my absence from the colony last winter some persons here,  who can be relied upon, have seen white frost one morning. This is  of extremely rare occurrence, but anyhow very remarkable for the  latitude of 10Â° 26', even at the height of 6,500 feet.  The characteristics of this region are its clouded sky, its equable tem-  perature, and its great amount of moisture. It is the '^' happy  region of the ferns,\" where these interesting plants find their most  suitable climate and grow in the greatest profusion. Here it is where  the stately tree-fern sometimes is seen to reach a height of 40 feet.  The produce most profitable to raise in the colony are potatoes, rye,  and oats. The apple tree grows side by side with the banana. The  strawberry is found in the greatest abundance, spontaneously grow-  ing about the fields. Indian corn does not come to maturity here,  while I have seen it raised and matured in Santa Fe, New Mexico,  which is at least 700 feet higher than the colony, and besides this is  near 36Â° north latitude. But in New Mexico they have a cloudless sky  nearly the whole year round and an extremely dry atmosphere, while  the colonists of Tovar are not much molested from the beginning of  May to the beginning of January by the rays of the sun.   182 METEOROLOGY.  The valley in which Colonia Tovar is situated was, so late as De-  cember, 1S41, a perfect wilderness, covered with primitive forest.  Not even the existence of this valley was known fifteen years ago,  neither to the government nor to its owner, although it is only thirty-  five miles west of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, and in a straight  line cannot be more than twelve miles from the sea. And when an  attempt was made to explore this region not even a guide could he  found for the small exploring party of fifteen men, headed by Colonel  Codazzi, a skillful officer and compiler of the new map of Venezuela.  When this party at last succeeded in crossing this region and reaching  the sea-shore, they thought they had achieved a most extraordinary  thing, (to cross a distance of twelve miles in six days;) and after they  had returned to their homes none of them had a desire to do the feat  over again. This was a party of natives. And when, at a later  period, after the establishment of the colony, another skillful engi-  neer found, with a party of colonists, his way to the opposite port of  the sea-shore, the party did not venture to go back the same route, but  rather chose the way by sea to Laguayra, from there to Caracas and  back to the colony, a very circuitous route certainly. Such is the  nature of this mountain region, with its precipices, waterfalls, deep  ravines, and its dense, almost impenetrable primeval forests.  In collecting botanical specimens, I have penetrated, without a com-  panion, the wilderness around in different directions, also that on the  other side of the principal mountain range towards the sea, and can  testify to the difficulties and hardships which are met with in. exploring  such a country. On excursions of this kind the most needful thing  besides a comjiass is a short sabre, called \"machetta,\" which I have  to use continually in cutting through the lianos, the erect and climbing  canes, the under shrub, which is all matted and intermingled in a  thousand different ways into a dense mass of vegetation.  In these woods, where the rays of the sun never touch the ground,  there it is Avhere moisture and a cool temperature reign forever. The  trunk of every tree and its branches are covered with Ferns, Lyco-  podiaceee, Kosses, Hepaticfe, Lichens, Orchids, Bromeliads, Aracece  and besides Piperacce with many exogenous plants too numerous to  mention..  The soil in these forests is one entire mass of slender rootlets most  completely intei mingled and interwoven, more than a foot in thickness,  the interstices filled with a brown but imperfectly decomposed vege-  table mould, which is kept in its place by the network of the rootlets.  This stratum is covered with mosses and remnants of leaves, so that  on the mountain ridges not only the ground, but also the trunks and  branches of the trees, act like a thick layer of sponges in retaining the  water that either pours down in form of rain or settles more slowly  in the form of mist and clouds. This water is allowed to trickle and  sink down but very gradually, and is, therefore, a never-failing source  from which are constantly fed the many little rivulets that hurry down  the steep declivities into their common receptacle^ the narrow chasm  of the river Tuy, which, in one continued row of cascades, rushes  thundering down SE. and S. until after a run of twenty miles, turn-  ing suddenly to the east^ it finds a more level country.   METEOROLOGY. 183  In the depth of such a mass of vegetation, when man is by himself,  a feeling of loneliness takes the ascendency over every other emotion ;  no animal is seen, and but seldom the voice of a bird heard. While  on the sea-side of the mountains I was only made twice aware of the  vicinity of a bird in two days. In the neighborhood of farms and  habitations of men a greater variety of birds are seen and heard, and  sometimes the grunting or howling of monkeys and the deafening  cry of parrots.  The dry season commences here generally soon after New Year's  day and lasts till the end of April. The remainder of the year is  taken up by the rainy season. This is generally so, for there are many  exceptions, and our notions about the great regularity and sharply  defined seasons of the tropics, which we have received from books, are  sometimes materially upset and corrected by experience. When I first  came to the colony, in March, 1854, we had a dr}- season in its usual  way. The rainy season then commenced on the 23d of April, but it  did not end with the latter part of December, as is usually the case;  it lasted till the end of January, and commenced again with the first  of March, and then kept uniformly on till the end of December, 1855.  The dry season was, therefore, only of one month's duration instead of  four. The last dry season has been, on the contrary, unusually long,  and lasted till the latter part of May.  I have often thought that the climate of North America may stand  in some kind of relation to the climate of this country. It was on  the 24th of December, 1853, when I left New York, to sail for La-  guayra. We were hardly out of sight of land when a i'urious NW.  gale, a real hurricane, (which is still in fresh remembrance with some  of the captains I have lately seen,) during a period of three days threat-  ened our destruction. Atter my arrival in Venezuela I was told that  about Christmas, 1853, one of the most fearful gales from the north was  telt at Laguayra.* Another question is, whether the late remarkably  dry and cold winter of the United States and the unusually long dry  season of Venezuela, as also the remarkable appearance of white frost  in the colony, are not connected in some way or other.  As to the trade winds, I found on my trip from Philadelphia to  Laguayra that within the tropics we had no E.NE. wind, which is  thought to be the regular trade winds of those regions. After cross-  ing latitude 23^Â°, in longitude 684Â°, we were becalmed for one day, and  soon after got a fresh breeze from the south, which we kept all the  way to longitude 63^. By tacking we got to latitude 22Â°, longitude  63^Â°. From thence we had the wind all the time from S.SE , which  we kept to latitude 11|Â° the day before we reached Laguayra. Capt.  Wilkins, who has been in this southern trade for eighteen years,  assured me that within the last eight years he never could depend  much upon the trade winds. He finds that between latitude 23Â° and  18Â° the south wind frequently keeps on blowing very brisk for eight  days in succession.  On the way from the colony to' Caracas, along the high ridge of  the principal mountain chain, which stretches E. and W., parallel  â– ^ See page 188.   184 METEOROLOGY.  with the coast, at an elevation of from 7,000 to 8,000 feet, we travel  about six miles over a region hare of forest, where we nearly at all  times find a very strong breeze from the south, rushing up the declivity  and over the ridge, hurries off to the north towards the ocean. The  ocean can be plainly seen from this elevation. That this great current  of air does not sink down along the northern slope, but, on the con-  trary, is somewhat projected upwards by tlie shape of the mountain,  can be seen by the course of the condensed vapors which, in the form  of fog and mist, are driven along. May not this current of air sink  gradually lower and lower until it reaches about latitude 18Â°, where  jt strikes the sea? I have found this south wind at sea always much  colder than any of the other winds in these latitudes.  I wish I was in possession of some good work on the winds and the  currents of the ocean.  Vegetation at the colony is uninterrupted throughout the whole  year, except in a small class of plants which cannot thrive without a  great deal of moisture. Even in the dry season, when the lower re-  gions are parched up with heat, if there is any moisture at all in  the atmosphere capable of being condensed, the mountainous districts,  especially those covered with forests, are sure to get some of it. Trees  here are evergreens; they keep their branches and twigs clothed with  leaves until death. Day after day, and month after month, the sur-  rounding forest presents the same unchanged view in its deep green  garment. Single leaves fall here and there one by one ; and new  leaves appear as slowly and gradually as the old ones die away â€” un-  noticed and unobserved. The pleasing and hope-inspiring spectacle  of returning spring, in the sudden appearance of the new and tender  foliage, as seen in the temperate regions, is here unknown.   CoLONiA TovAK, January 8, 1857.  Dear Sir : Under date of August 5 I sent you a letter and some  registers of meteorological observations up to the 31st of July, which,  I hope, you will have received long before this.  Inclosed in a separate envelope I send you now four meteorological  registers for the months of August, September, October and Novem-  ber, I would have sent one for December also, but I have no more  blanks.  Besides these registers, I have inclosed diagrams* on four separate  sheets, one table of half-hourly barometrical observations, and one  about the course of the clouds.  The barometrical observations in the registers have their full value  only up to October 30, at 2 p. m ; for when I looked at the height  of the mercury one hour afterwards I found it more than one inch  below its usual level. This was so extraordinary that I expected  something wrong with the instrument. As soon as I touched it the  whole column of mercury sank rapidly down. In unscrewing the  brass cup which contains the little leather bag I found the former  half filled with mercury. On the surface of the bag, a little below  * The diagrams and curves could not be given in this report.   METEOROLOGY. 185  where it is tied and where it was in contact with the surrounding  brass tube, I found a spot of one-eighth of an inch diameter, as if cor-  roded by some kind of acid In the centre of this spot was a hole one-  sixteenth inch diameter. The corroded rim around the hole was very  smooth and viscid, similar to partly dissolved india rubber. After  sewing up the whole and giving it a coat of glue, to prevent the mer-  cury from leaking out, 1 filled the glass tube again as cautiously as pos-  sible, to prevent the formation of air bubbles. In this I succeeded pretty  well, and, with the exception of one minute portion of air, which  escaped into the vacuum, the latter seemed to be complete. The  mercury then showed but a small difference (yo g ^^ yJo parts of an  inch lower) compared with its former state. Hoping to succeed still  better the second time, I tried my hand once more at it, but did not  succeed so well this time, as some moisture had settled in the glass  tube. The mercury is now at least one-tenth of an inch lower than it  ought to be.  The barometrical observations made with this instrument since the  1st November, 1856, can, of course, not be considered as normal, and  can be used only with a view to institute comparisons among them-  selves.  I feel this defect the more acutely as I hoped to measure a number  of mountains and other localities, and to complete a twelve months'  register, to find out the mean height of the barometrical column for  the different months of the year. Up to the 1st November I found  the mean height greatest in July. Hitherto I have measured only  the pass over the mountains on the road from the colony to Victoria.  On this spot the barometer was 23.334 at 7A. 30m. a. m., September 9,  with the thermometer at 61Â°.  In the diagrams on sheet No. 1,1 have laid down, in a graphical  manner, the hourly and half-hourly rise and fall of the barometer from  6 a. m. till 9 p. m. for 12 days. We can see here, at once, the greater  amplitude of the daily periodical variations in October compared with  that of June ; also that the hours of maximum of the different days  in October are not far apart from each other and near to 10^ a. m.,  and the hours of minimum not far from 4 p. m.; while, on the con-  trary, in June, the hours of maximum, as well as those of minimum,  are much more scattered, and therefore not so regular.  On sheet No. 2 are the half-hourly observations laid down for 24  hours, from 4 a. m., October 7, till 4 a. m. next day. Here we  observe that, in the morning, the maximum, as well as the minimum,  is somewhat higlier than the maximum and the minimum in the  evening. This seems to be a general rule with all the daily periodi-  cal variations.  On sheet No. 3 the daily mean barometer heights from June 10 to  October 30 are put down and connected by straight lines to denote the  course of the barometer from day to day throughout the several  months. A kind of periodical rising and sinking is observable here,  alternately taking place in periods of 4 or 5 days, at least for June,  July, August and September.  Oq sheet No. 4 is to be found a comparison of the mean monthly  barometer heights of Colonia Tovar with those of St. Louis, Mo.,   186 METEOROLOGY.  made by Dr. G. Englemann in 1851, which shows the remarkahly  small monthly variation in the colony against the extreme range of  atmospheric pressure at St. Louis.  In all these illustrations the barometer height has not been reduced  to the freezing jJoint for want of the necessary tables ; but, as the  difference of temperature connected with these observations does not  range much over 8 degrees F., the results may be considered not far  from their true value.  Table No. 5 shows that the most prevailing currents of air at an  elevation of about 7,000 or 8,000 feet above the level of the sea, in the  months of June, July, August, September and October, are here from  E., E.SE., SE., S.SE.,and S., but especially from SE.  Table No. 6 contains half-hourly barometrical observations for 17  days, taken down at three different periods of the year. From this  and* from sheet No 1 we see that the amplitude of the daily periodical  variations is not a constant quantity in one and the same place, but  changes with the different periods of the year ; as also does the hour of  maximums and minimums. To find out, by continued observation,  the mean amount of amplitude and the precise time of the maximums  and minimums ibr each month of the year seemed to me desiderata of  much interest to meteorology.  With a view to investigate this matter I have made observations  accordingly. The first set I made Irom 18th to 24th June; the  second, from 1st to 7th October ; the third, from 10th to 12th Novem-  ber, and the fourth, from 22d to 28th December. These observations  give the mean amplitude for the latter part of June 058 ; for the  first part of October, 0.079 ; for November, 0.060, and for the end of  December, 0.043.  By a peculiar view of the cause of periodical variations, and by the  aid of an artificial globe, I had calculated as early as last September  that the amplitude at Colonia Tovar ought to be greatest about the  16th May and 26fch September, and least on the 21st January. The  above-mentioned numbers of amplitude for October, November, and  December coincide with my calculations so far, and it remains to be  seen how they will do for the remaining portion of the year.  With regard to temperature I will only say that the mean of the  three months of June, July, and August, (that is, of the meteorological  summer,) is 58 9 ; the mean of September, October, and November  (the meteorological autumn) is 58.9, or exactly the same. The mean  temperature of December is 56.6. During 204 days (from June 10  to December 31) the sky was only once free of clouds at 2 p m., 18  times free at 7 a. m., and 41 times at 9 p. m. Of these 204 days 143  were rainy days.  On the 5th of January I made a botanical excursion to one of the  highest mountains of this region, about twelve miles to the east of  the colony. The mountain, according to my estimation, may be about  7j800 feet above the level of the sea, and is a kind of central point or  knot, from which several rivers, flowing in different directions, take  their origin. This mountain is covered by a dense forest, with the  exception of a level spot of about half a mile in length and a quarter   METEOROLOGY. 187  of a mile in width, -which forms a Idncl of shallow hasin, only spar-  ingly covered by a thin coat of short grass and oUier small plants.  These ])lants I found the next morning at six o'clock white and  stiffened with heavy hoar frost, which augmented and lasted till the  rays of the sun fell upon it. The stiffened leaves of the herbs broke  under the least pressure, like thin layers of ice. The thermometer  was 37Â° at 67i. 30m. From all the information I could gather, hoar  frost seems to be common in this spot throughout the months of Janu-  ary and February. The wind blew during the night from northeast,  and was very })iercing.  Notwithstanding this low temperature, the forests of the neighbor-  ing heights surrounding this basin are clothed in perpetual green,  and the stately wax palm, with its straight and polished trunk of  70 or 80 leet, (by actual measurement,) rears, uninjured, its slender  form and its leaf adorned head high above all other trees.  In this excursion I had also an opportunity to form some idea of the  vast extent of destruction which was carried into the mountain forest  last February by a lucifer match and a thoughtless boy. Over whole  tracts of this primeval forest the trees lie dead one over the other, as  if uprooted by a whirlwind, scarcely showing any marks of fire on  their trunks. I was struck more than ever with the easy manner in  which fire can destroy these dense and humid forests, which, by cheir  shade, preserve a cool and moist atmosphere, and thereby cause the  vapors ox the adjacent strata of air to condense into clouds, that rest  upon them, with little intermission, during nine months in the year.  In these high regions the temperature is so low and equable that the  vegetable matter which is gathered on the ground between the trees  is decomposed very incom])letely and very slowly. It forms a stratum  of loose half-decomposed matter, in some places two to three feet thick,  which, in the rainy season, like an immense layer of sponge filled,  with water, feeds and supplies the rivulets and rivers gradually. In  the midst of the dry season this layer becomes sometimes dry enough  to burn, when kindled, with but little flame, and more like tinder,  spreading in all directions.  In this way the fire extends until met by a river or a road, or some  other obstacle. The sub-soil which underlies the spongy stratum on  these mountains is also very shallow and resting on hard rocks. The  roots of the trees therefore, do not go down very deep, but extend  more in a horizontal direction. When the spongy layer, with the  smaller roots, are burnt, the trees lose their hold entirely and I'all, one  over the other, in all directions. They die less from being burnt than  from being uprooted. Many different kinds of tall reeds soon take  the place of the trees. In a few years these reeds exclude everything  else. The fertile mould that may perhaps have escaped destruction  by fire is by and by carried down the declivities by the frequent rains.  The region, no longer sh-^ded by high trees, becomes diy. Subse-  quent conflagrations of adjacent savannahs, which are intentionally  set on fire to procure a new growth of young grass, take hold of the  reeds of the ruined forest, until, by the repeated attacks of these fires,  the roots of the reeds can stand it no longer, and the smaller grasses,  interspersed with a lew other plants, take their places.   188   METEOEOLOGY.   On the road from tlie colony to Caracas we pass through a region  in which this procestj is going on ; the reeds giving gradually way to  the smaller grasses. Here the great number of half burnt yet stand-  ing trunks of the wax palm tell plainl}'^ enough that there existed not  long ago a dense and humid forest, in which they luxuriated in all  their beauty, for these palms are never found, in their natural state,  growing in any other but humid forests. Here they stand isolated  in the midst of reeds. Most of them have died already, but many  linger yet in a dying condition, until their last green leaf has turned  brown, and then they stand like tall and slender pillars, the mournful  remnants of a once stately forest.  This is the same extensive region of which I spoke in my first letter,  where a strong southern breeze-, sometimes amounting to a gale,  sweeps constantly over the mountain ridge towards the sea. I have  traversed this region since at four different times, in the months of  August and September, and found every tiaie the same southern wind  blowing there, only somewhat more violent.  Before closing this letter I wish to add to the statement made in  my first letter* about the gale of December 24, 1853, that my inform-  ant here, in saying that the gale was felt at Laguayra^ forgot to men-  tion that it was felt only in the unprecedented agitation of the ocean,  but not in the atmosphere. This agitation of the sea is observed every  time a violent gale from the north has been blowing in the higher  latitudes, not the least breeze from the north being felt at the same  time at Laguayra, although it is an open roadstead, not in the least  sheltered against the north winds. This agitation of the sea, when  the air was perfectly calm, I have seen myself several times at La-  guayra; but at the time above mentioned the sea was so unusually  high that long, enormous, foam-crested waves rolled up to the very  parapet of the custom-house, a phenomenon scarcely ever seen before.  During my stay in Victoria, a town twenty miles south of the  colony, situate in a valley about 1,700 feet above the level of the sea,  I made the following observations as to the temperature of that place:   December ....â€¢â€¢   21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29      701  86  74   69  86  72   69  75  72i   69  75  72   68  81i  71'   63  83  72   68  84  72   69  84  74   66    84   9 p. m... ...... ..........      The dry season has already set in, and my time is so much taken up  by botanical labors, on which my sustenance depends, that I am un-  able to give at present a more full and extended account of the climate  and other atmospherical phenomena of this region.

Dear Sir : Your kind letter of March 5, was received by me in due  time, and a little box with eight pounds of mercury, for which I  thank you very much, came to hand somewhat later, on the 3d of May.  Soon after the receipt of the mercury I went to work to fill the  barometer tube accoiding to your directions ; but with every new trial  I ibund that the mercury fell more and moie below its standard  height, although I was certain there could be no air above it. At  first I could assign no cause for this failure ; but the fact that I was  losing regularly at every new trial suggested to me the idea, that in  handling the mercury the latter might have taken moisture from the  atmosphere. Accordingly, I placed the barometer tube containing the  mercuiy and a Torricellian vacuum in a nearly horizontal position  cautiously over a brisk charcoal fire, and in this way htatfd the  mercury for some time, until no more bubbles were disengaged. I  was hereby especially struck with the great quantity of escaping  moisture, and never thought that mercury could have taken up so  much from the atmosphere during the short period required lor filling  the tube. Can this property be due to the nitric acid, with which the  mercury may have been purified, and which is known to absorb mois-  ture from the air? Thus, by boiling, and at the same time making,  use of your directions, I succeeded perfectly well in bringing the level  of the mercury up to its standard value. In such a damp atmosphere  as this the boding of the mercury seems to be indispensable.  I have now the pleasur( to say, that since the 9th of May the  barometer may be considered to be as correct and precise as when I  first received it.  In a separate envelope accompanying my present communication, I  have the pleasure of sending you besides the meteorological registers  for six months, a short essay on the cause of the daily periodical  variations of the baroujeter, and a number of tables and diagrams.   METEOROLOGY. 213  Tables No. 2 a and 2 b contain half-hourly observations on the  daily periodical variation of the barometer for 31 days, made with a  view to determine the precise time of maximums and miniraums and  ;the amount of daily am|:)litu(le. With regard to the latter, if we take  the mean of every six days in successit>n, beginning with the 10th of  'May, we get the following mean amplitudes: .OfiO, .070, .068, .066,  '.064; showing a gradual rise and fall in the numbers. The greatest  jraean amplitude is for the period from 16th to 2l8t May, so that even  ithese additional numbers are still in accordance with the view taken  iwithregaid to the amount of amplitude tor the different periods of  ithe .vear, allided to in my last letter. All the half hourly observa-  [tions u[) to June 9, inclusive, hitherto made by me on the subject of  i periodical variation, whicli are for 56 days, prove for the occurrence of  I the a. m. maximum, the average time to be at IQh. lO^m. a. m., and for  Ithe J), ra. minimum 4/i. Z\\^m. p. m., which seems to agree pretty well  with the time of daily maximums and minimums found in other parts  of tlie globe.  Table No. 3 is to exhibit the cumber of hours of rain during the  diftt'rent times of the day for each month from July, 1856, to May,  1857, recapitulated from tables No. 6 e and/. The vertical distance  of the curve a b c from the base a d gives us the mean value of dura-  tion of rain for any given time of the day between 6 a. m. and 6 p. m.  This curve is the expression of the mean for eight months from July,  1856, to February, 1857, and is laid down according to the mean  numbers directly above it. It demonstrates very plainly that in the  moining between 6 and 7 there was no rain; but with the advance  of the day the rain augmented and reached its maximum between 2  and 3 p. m., whence it gradually abated towards evening. During  the night it very seldom rains. Mr. Boussingault's observations,  which he made in another part of South America near Marraato, prove  that at that jjjace more rain fell at night than during the day ; and he  says, in his Rural Economy, \"every one in South America allows that  it rains principally during the night.\" Now this is in direct opposi-  tion with my observations here, and it shows, therefore, that a ceitain  state of the weather, especially with regard to rain, may sometimes be  limited to small districts only.  From table No. 3 we also see that the month of February, which  is commonly considered to be one of the dryest of the ; ear, and pro-  perly belonging to the very centre of the dry season, has been the  wettest mouth of the year, with the exception of May. The dryest  months were March and April.  By a glance at the tables No. 6 a to 6 /, we may have a ready  survey over the dry and wet months of the year and the distribution  of rain in general. Here we tind that the limits of the dry and the  rainy seasons are not very distinct, and from May, 1854, till the end  of 1855, a period of 20 months, we find no well defined dry season,  the mduth of February, 1855, being the dryest. But with New Year's  Day, 1856, there commences a dry season which lasts for five months,  the longest and dryest the colonists ever enjoyed. And it was in this  extraordinary dry period that the loose layer of half decomposed vege-   214   METEOROLOGY.   table matter, of which I spoke in my last letter, got to be dry enou^^h  to take fire. Â°  The dry season of the present year we recognize only in the months  of March and April and a part of January. From inquiry, I learn  that well defined dry seasons have also been rather rare previous to  my stay in the colony.  Table No. 4 gives the course of the clouds for seven months. The  most numerous direction is as usual from south and east and the points  intermediate amounting to 293. As a striking feature may be noticed  the increase m the number of currents from the south since January,  when there are only six, while in April we find 37 and in May 31.  This may well account for the fact, which captains of vessels trading  between the United States and the coast of Venezuela have noticed so  frequently, of meeting during the months of April and May with  steady blowing southern breezes, and which I had an opportunity to  notice myself on my last voyage to Laguayra. In some places east of  the colony, on the back of the Cordilleras of the coast, I have experienced  this steady current from the south as often as I had occasion to  traverse this region on my way to Caracas, with the exception of only  once. It amounts sometimes to a strong breeze. Other colonists,  who frequent this road more than I do, have noticed this remarkable  wind nearly at all times of the year.    e ^   sea   ^mx^'-NW ^^^\\ Av'^ A\\ \\    N   S   Several times I had a most excellent opportunity for observing and  tracing the course of this southern current to a great distance in the  direction south and north. I was then standing on the very crest of  the mountains of Hie coast, having a view towards the north upon the  sea, and towards the south over a part of the fertile valleys of Aragua.  Scattered masses of clouds showed plainly by their motion the direc-  tion of the current in a long line, whence it came and whither it went.  The annexed figure may serve to give a somewhat clearer idea. It is  to represent a vertical section of the territory from south to north, a  the place of observation, V the valleys between the northern and  southern ranges, c c clouds moving witli the eastern trade-winds  towards the west, the line b d the track of the high southern current,  which had a velocity of about twelve miles per hour, and a somewhat  sinking tendency, until it struck the northern range, where it was  forced upwards for a short distance until it reached the crest, and  then went on unobstructed on the other side of the mountains, in a  horizontal line, apparently lowering but very little, leaving hereby  the eastern trade-winds of the sea tar below and undisturbed in their  regular and steady course, which is nearly at right angles to that of   METEOROLOGY. - 215  the former. The lower clouds of the valleys showed plainly a motion  from east to west, as seen against the dark background of the south-  ern mountains. The high southern current was not indicated by  clouds in those places where it was vertically over the lowest parts of  the valley ; but when drawing nearer to the Cordilleras, on which I  stood, the vapors which it contained condensed rapidly, and became  visible as drifting, incoherent clouds sweeping by, and which could  still be seen on the sea-side as long as they floated over the dense  primeval forest, which extends here from the mountains' tops to the  ver}' margin of the sea.  Here I rnay also remark that the great amount of cloudiness, which  in some respects may be regarded as a disadvantage to observation,  offers, with regard to the currents of the atmosphere, great advan-  tages, the condensed vapors indicating the various motions and direc-  tions of these currents, and I have had, therefore, opportunities to  observe them in most of their various forms. Sometimes I have seen  the air ascend and descend vertically with considerable velocity, at  other times pushed up the inclined planes of mountain flanks on one  side until reaching the crest, and then gliding or flowing down on  the other side somewhat like a liquid, following in its course the most  depressed localities and ravines in all their windings. Sometimes the  eastern currents may be seen in their gradually ascending but nearly  horizontal course to meet the higher southern current at right angles,  and, without mixing, to be deflected by the latter in a horizontal semi-  circle, or downward or upward, as the case may be. I have also seen  two opposite currents meet, when each endeavored to force its antago-  nist back with alternate success and failure^ until one got the better  over the other, and at last kept undisputed sway.  At certain seasons of the year we may see extensive sheets of cloudy  masses press closely over the northern or the southern range of the  colony valley, and gliding down the declivity for a short distance  become invisible and disappear in crossing the cultivated part of the  valley, but reappear again on drawing near the opposite ridge. Fre-  quently I have seen immense masses of clouds leaning against the  northern side of the crest of the mountains, and as if stuck to them, for  whole days, and while the base was gently sliding upwards towards  the south, the top of the cloud, which was towering above the moun-  tains, was bent back and moving slowly in an opposite direction.  When standing on some high mountain, esjjecially early in the  morning, I have seen dazzling white coherent masses of clouds filling  up far below me whole valleys, the surface of these clouds representing  immense and level snow fields, from which, in a most lovely and  striking contrast, the green summits of the smaller mountains pro-  truded as so many islets, or higher and lesser promontories of a frozen  arm of the ocean. The delusion is sometimes most complete, and  cannot be viewed without feelings of pleasure and surprise. The ele-  vation oi the upper surlace of these clouds was between 5,000 and 6,000  feet above the level of the sea.  A striking feature in table No. 4 may be found in the prevalence of  northern currents from November till February, inclusive, while they  are much rarer or entirely wanting in March, April, and May.   216 METEOROLOGY.  Among the number of days free from clouds we find that at 2 p. m.  throug^hout all the twelve months there was only one sintrle day where  the sky was entirely clear, but at 9 p. m. we liad a clear sky on eighty-  eight days. In the month of September the sky was during all the  ninety observatinns made in that month more or less clouded. At 2  p. m. the sky was entirely overcast on one hundred and thirty-five  days. In May it was entirely overcast during forty-seven observations.  The number of rainy days is two hundred and thirteen.  Table No. 5 contains observations on the motion of strata of clouds  of different heights.  Observations on the motion of the highest clouds would be very  important, but in this region we are unable to make a great number  of such observations on account of the cloudy state of the sky, and we  have to make the best of the few opportunities we may now and then  get. As April is one of the most favorable months for this purpose,  1 have chosen this time, and have taken peculiar pains in collecting  the facts contained in table No 5. The greatest difficulty hereby ex-  ists in telling exactly which of the many different thin strata of clouds  are the higher and which the lower ones. I was sometimes obliged  to watch them for ten minutes right over head ; but knowing that  inaccurate observations are infinitely worse than none at all, I did not  shun any inconvenience to arrive at the true motion of the different  strata.  From this table we see that in the upper and highest regions the  following winds were observed chiefly to occur: W.NW., W.SW.,  N. ; in the middle regi' ns, sav from 7,000 to 9,000 feet above the sea,  S SE., W.SW., N.NW., N.NE ; and in the lower region, say from  7,000 down to 5,000 feet and still lower, S.SE., E., ESE.  I may here remark that, from long continued observation on the  motion of the clouds, 1 am inclined to believe that all the easterly  winds of this region are gradually ascending in their course towards  the west, while the southern as well as the western currents are  gradually descending in their course.  Diagram No. 7 gives a view of the curve of mean monthly tempera-  ture for Colonia Tovar compared with the curves for New Orleans, St.  Louis, Missouri, and Boothia Felix. I have chosen these three latter  places because they are all North American, and lying nearly under  one and the same degree of longitude, but in difierent latitudes ;  Boothia Felix in north latitude 70.2Â°.  Diagram No. 8 contains all the mean daily heights of the barometer  from November 7, 1856, to April 30, 1857, and from May 9 to June 3.  A similar diagram for June to October. 1856, I have sent alrea ly with  one of my former letters. At that time I remarked that a kind of  periodical rising and falling in periods from four to five days was ob-  servable, but I did not then expect that this rule would hold out for  the remainder of the year. ' But after I had finished diagram No. 8,  merely to see what kind of curve these months would present to the  eye, I was struck with its appearance in siiape, and induced to count  the days from vertex to vertex, which, commencing with November  11, gave me the following numbers : 6, 5, 2, 5, 6, 4, 4^ 3, 6, 4, 6, 3   METEOROLOGY. 217  5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 7, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6, 5, 5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 4 =  167, of which the mean is 4.5 days, as the mean period occurring be-  tween every two succes-sive heights or vertices.  The same process applied to the former diagram of the months of  June to October, 1856, gives me the following numbers: 5, 4, 5, 3,  5, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 4, 3, 4, 6, 10, {= 2 + 5,)  5, 5, 5 =: 128, of which the mean number is 4.4 days. For May,  1857, commencing with the 14th, the numbers are 3, 5, 5, 5, 3.  No m-itter whether the barometer had a perfect vacuum or nof , the  features of this remarkable phenom^enon are the same. The two series  of the above numbers, and the coincidence of their mean value, prove  beyond a doubt that they are not the result of mere accident ; but that  this i)eriodical fluctuation in the pressure of the atmosphere is subject  to a certain law, of whicli I am ignorant.  l>iaiiram No. 9 exhibits two curves of the mean temperature for  Colonia Tovar for twelve months. The upper curve is the result of  noting down the mean temperature for evexy third port of the month,  and presents quite a different appearance compared with the lower  curve, in which are noted down the mean temperatures of the whole  months only. The latter part of April and the middle of September  show the highest, and the middle of January the lowest teniperature.  July has usually a lower temperature than the three months on either  side of it. The mean temj)eratures of the four meteorological seasons  present the curious fact that three of them, spring, summer, and  autumn, have exactly the same temperature, viz : 58.9, even to a  fraction. The mean tem}Â»erature of the year is 58.2 ; difference be-  tween the coldest and warmest month, 5.3.  The temperature of the primeval forest, about two hundred yards  distant from my dwelling, was, on the 25th of April, at \\h. iSOm.  p. m., 61Â°, at the margin 64Â°, when at ray house the thermometer  was 65Â°. In a shady ravine I stuck the thermometer four inches deep  into the spongy brown vegetable mould at different times of the day,  and found the temperature always 59Â°, pretty near the mean tem-  perature of the year. 58Â° or 59Â° may be considered to be the constant  temi)erature of this region about twelve inches below the surface of  the y;round in shady places.  I have often observed that, whenever the sun breaks through the  clouds and has been shining for a couple of hours, the thermom-  eter fluctuates frequently very suddenly from one to four degrees,  according as it is touched by a warmer or colder current of air pro-  ceeding from the diifrently heated localities of the soil; but when  the sky is entirely overcast such changes never take place.  It seems somewhat remakable that, at Colonia Tovar, no heavy  thunder-storms occur. Thunder and lightning are seldom strong  enough to deserve to be mentioned. Trusting to past experience  with regard to the absence ol tempests, hurricanes, and whirlwinds,  I have covered the roof of my house with very thin and light shingles,  not nailed down, as is done in the States, but merely hung loosely  upon laths without any weather-boarding at all. And yet, for two   2 1 8 METEOROLOGY.  years, they have remained in this position undisturbed by winds and  weather.  The stars are here seen to scintillate on every clear evening the  same as they do in hii^her latitudes, with the exception of a small  area in the zenith of about 45 degrees, where they have their steady  planetary light mentioned by Humboldt, and to be observed in lower  regions. The zodiacal light I have never been able to see in the  colony, although I have looked for it every clear evening.  Besides the already enumerated tables and diagrams, I have also  inclosed four sheets of copies of sculptured rocks, or, as they are called  in this country, \" piedras pintadas,\" (painted stones.)  These rocks, which I have found in diiferent regions, in low hot  valleys as well as on high cold mountains, seem to be the work of one  and the same race of men. The original figures are on a large scale.  A few well-preserved spots, sheltered by a layer of sandy soil against  the destructive influence of the atmosphere, show that the outlines of  these figures are grooves, engraved or chiseled very smoothly and  regularly to the depth of at least an inch in the hardest rock, and  evinces a skill which would do credit to any of the civilized inhabitants  now living in this country, even when aided by tools of steel There  is no mere scratching about them ; they have been sculptured. They  show clearly that they were worked to last, and to outlive full many  a change in the history of nations. The delineations are in all of  them, whether from the sultry and insalubrious coast of Puerto  Cabello, or from the cold mountain regions of the colony, of the same  kind of workmanship, consisting of grooves about an inch wide and  an inch deep.  Time has worked sadly at most of these stones, and on some of  them I found only traces of figures.  All these rocks I found by accident in my botanical rambles, in  places where I never would have ventured to penetrate, and where I  was led by necessity when strayed and trying to find my way back.  Whatever may be said of these figures, patiently worked into the  rock, they were not done without a certain design. Whether they  were intended to convey any peculiar meaning, or none at all, the  Indians have hereby bequeathed to us the means of comparing them  with similar monuments in other distant regions. So much is certain,  they were worked with the intention to remain there for a long period  of time, and to be looked at by posterity. These figures consist in  images of objects, with which their makers were surrounded and ac-  qua nted, as, for instance, alligators or large lizards, snakes, tigers,  canoes, sun, moon, human heads, &c., but show no signs of imple-  ments of civilization. Therefore these figures may be supposed to  date anterior to the conquest of the country by the Spaniards. No  record of the existence of these rocks, I suppose, has hitherto ever been  made, for this region has been discovered l)ut very lately, and none  of the natives living in the neighboring valleys have known anything  about them. In this case I may have been the first and only stranger  who ever beheld their yet lasting works, of which they took so much  pains to make a show in after years.   METEOROLOGY. 219  But how fallacious are often the most unpretending expectations of  nations as well as of individuals. These Indians, as a tribe or nation,  may have removed, or become extinct, or been driven away ; for cer-  tain it is that they are gone, and have vanished from this region.  Month after month and year after year (until amounting to centuries)  went silently on over the only yet remaining witnesses of their existence.  The luminaries of day and night had their glittering rays alternately  reflected from the inclined and even surfaces of these rocks ; the rain  ran down innumerable times as from a roof and washed the figures  clean. Wind and water and oxygen and beat worked slowly but  effectually at the destruction of the figure-furrowed surface, and suc-  ceeded but too well. But no one fcarae to wonder at the skill and  patience of their makers. Fifty or a hundred years more would have  done their destructive work com{)letely, and these figures would have  vanished and gone, probably without having been noticed even by a  single individual.  Occupied with such reflections as these, when seated near the sim-  ple memorials just spoken of, I feel myself richly remunerated for all  my fatigue and the trouble to snatch them from oblivion.  That these sculptured rocks were intended to be seen and noticed is  proved by the fact that they are never found in the primeval forest,  but most generally in some prominent part of a savannah, bordering  on the forest, although now overgrown with brushwood and reeds.  Some of the figures were found in a place partly overgrown with small  trees, or rather shrubs of a stunted growth, mostly of small specimens  of clusia, which fact may prove how slowly a dry savannah, even when  undisturbed by fire, is rechanged again into a forest ; while it takes  but a few years to change, by the aid of fire, a forest into a savannah.  These localities show, also, clearly enough to a person acquainted  with the mode of agriculture in the mountainous districts that the  Indians have subsisted on agriculture and not on the chase, for by the  latter not even a dozen individuals could keep themselves alive for any  length of time, much less a whole tribe.  The barometer which I carried to the region of the sculptured rocks  assigns to them a height of about 5,900 feet above the ocean. When  we consider the wet, cold, disagreeable, and foggy weather which  prevails during the greater part of the year in this region, where the  Creoles, in coming up from the warmer valleys, sometimes shiver with  cold, where the banana and other cultivated tropical plants seldom  bear fruit, and where Indian corn can only be raised with difficulty  or not at all, we may perhaps be inclined to think that the Indians  chose this cold region from predilection; and in this case might proba-  bly have descended from the same stock that peopled and preferred  the high regions of the Peruvian Andes. But when we afterwards  find similar rocks near the hot and sultry coast of Puerto C<bello, and  in other low valleys, the above inferences would have to undergo con-  siderable modification.  A corn or maize-grinder is in general use amongst the Creoles of  Venezuela, which, considering its very rude and simple construction,   220   METEOSOLOGY.    seems not to be of European invention. It consists merely of a flat  stone a ]| foot long,  14 inches wide, and 3  inches thick, somewhat  convex on the lower  and concave on the  upper surface ; the con-  cavity h is flat, and 7  inches wide. The run-  ner r, with which the  corn is crushed, is a  stone about 5 inches  long, 3 inches wide, and  o^ an oval form, so as to  fit the concavity b. The  person crushing the corn  stands near the upper  end of the stone, and  holds the runner with  botli hands, and in crushing the previously soaked and somewhat  pounded corn brings to bear nearly the whole w-eight of the upper  part of the body upon the runner. The ground pulpy mass is shoved  ofF at the lower end of the stone into, some vessel. If the pulp is not  fiue enough it is crushed over again. This pulp, washed to remove  the 8kins of the corn, and then baked upon hot stoves, constitutes the  bread of all the Creoles not living in town. The whole work of  pounding and crushing is performed by females, and is a most tedious  drudgery. It is really astonishing that the people here have not yet  made use of the iron corn-grinders used so universally in the back-  woods of the United States, although they can be bought at Caracas.  The above rude corn-grinder, or rather corn-crusher, is used also to  crush roaeted coffee, cocoa, and salt, and has been even adopted by  some German families. I have been explicit on this subject, because  in Emory's \"Notes of a Military Reconnaissance,\" page 133, I find  made mention of a similar corn grinder used among the Pimos ; but  whether it is of the same shape as these here I have no means to  learn.  Barometrical measurement shows that the river Tuy, seven or eight  miles to the 8 SE of Colonia Tovar, is only about 3,100 feet above  the level of the sea, while at Colonia Tovar it is at least 6,000 ieet.  This river has therefore a descent of nearly 3,000 feet within eight  miles, or, on an average, a fall of 375 feet per mile. Such is the terri-  tory of tlie colony.  On the 28th of May I carried the barometer to the \" Picacho,\" one  of the highest peaks in the neighborhood of the colony, and found  the height of the mercury at 9i a. m. 22,736, thermometer 69^, from  which 1 conclude that this mountain may be only 500 or 600 feet in-  ferior in height to the \"Silla\" of Caracas, the highest peak of the  coast range of Venezuela.  In travelling irom Victoria towards Valencia we find, about three   METEOROLOGY. 221  miles west of Tarmero, right in the middle of the road, the famous  \" Zamanijf,\" an enormous tree, so well described hy Alexander V.  Humboldt. Its heal, formed by enormous horizontal branches, is tbe  most remarkable part of this giant of trees. A section of its head  would present a shape as shown in the marginal figure.  I measured the head in its greatest diame-  ter from E Â«E. to W.NW. most careiully,  and found it to be 206 feet 11 inches, English.  Fifty-seven years ago it was found by ' â€” ^  Humboldt to measure in its greatest diameter 192 feet, Fr,ench mea-  sure, which would be equal to 204.48 feet, English. Hence, it follows  that this tree has within the last 57 years increased the horizontal  diameter of its head only by 2 feet 5 inches, English. The branches  are loaded with a wonderful mass of epiphytes and parasites ; and it  seems surprising that branches of nearly 100 feet in length, standing  horizontally out from the trunk, can support for centuries, besides  their own astonishing weight, such an extra load of heavy plants as  Bromeliaceai, Orchideje, Cactese, Loranthacefe, Piperaceee, &c.  This extraordinary tree is but thinly covered with leaves ; it looks  as if it lacks vigor to issue new slender branchlets, for its ultimate  branchlets are old, short, thick, and of stunted growth.  Setting out from Fetaquire, (a place nearly as high as the colony,)  on the 8th of February, in an excursion towards the sea coast^ my at-  tention was directed to some coioti^ees. The space over which they  were distributed was but very limited in the direction north and  south, but extended more towards east and west, and was about  3,500 feet above the sea Their external appearance, the shape of the  truok and leaves, agreed exactly with the description givea by Alex-  ander V. Humboldt. Most of them wore trees of 1 to 1^ foot in  diameter, but very tall. I also found some younger ones of 5 inches  diameter. In seven or eight of these trees of diti'erent age and di-  mensions, I made incisions, to see the milk flow. Although it was  about the same season of the year when Mr, A. V. Humboldt saw  the cow- tree between Valencia and Puerto Cabelio, I never could elicit  from then much more than 1 or 2 drops in a second of time. There  was not much difference in the flow of milk between the larger and  the smaller trees ; and if ever I was disappointed in my expectations I  certainly was on this occasion as to the quantity of milk. The milk  has an agreeable, mild, rather rich taste, and becomes somewhat sticky  between the fingers. People who live not far off, and have tried these  cow-trees in different years, do not praise much their milk-yielding  qualities. The cow-trees grow in the midst of shady, humid forests,  at an elevation of about 3,000 or 4,000 feet, along the sea-fronting  declivities of the high mountain range, stretching from east to west  along the northern coast of Venezuela. I have neither seen the fruit  nor the flowers of this tree ; but in comparing its leaves with leaves of  plants in my herbarium, I find the closest resemblance in shape,  structure and venation with some species of fig-trees. The wood is  white and of considerable hardness.  I passed the night in the midst of an immense forest^ on a thin  layer of dried grass, in a small, uninhabited^ open shed, (a plantain   222 METEOROLOGY.  leaf thatcbed roof, resting upon six isolated posts,) near to which a  tiger was said to have his range. Towards evening torrents of rain  poured down ; but the night was still and undisturbed, except by the  rushing mountain-stream at some distance oif, which appeared to the  watchful ear like the hollow rustling of a forest in a gale of wind.  One solitary bird near by made the spot still more melancholy by  its mournful notes, which it sent forth from time to time throughout  the night, unanswered by anything living.  These damp and shady primeval forests, especially when fronting  the sea, ar^ also to be noted for the great amount of ferns, with regard  to species as well as to individuals. This beautiful class of plants, of  which I have already collected 489 species within a comparatively  small part of the country, loves moisture, shade, and stagnoMt air, and  rarely ever succeeds in a climate or region which lacks these three  great necessary conditions. With regard to number of individuals,  the different heights show no marked effect. I found them in masses  equally dense at 1,50U and 6,500 feet elevation ; and I have descended  and ascended the flanks of the coast-chain in five different regions.  The only difference we see is the change of species in different  heights, and even here we find many species to extend over a great  area of different elevation ; but most species are rather of a local habit.  We can, therefore, from the amount of ferns which occurs in any  given place, not very well deduce the mean temperature of that place,  as is sometimes done in geology, in conjectures about the temperature  of the earth's surface at the time of deposition of the coal fields, unless  we know what temperature belongs to the luxuriant growth of that  very species which we wish to draw conclusions from. The yearly  mean temperature of the fern region may vary from 56Â° to 80Â° F^   CoLONiA TovAR, VENEZUELA, January 10, 1858.  Dear Sir: Under date of June 11, 1857, I sent you a letter, to-  gether with some meteorological registers and a number of tables and  diagrams, which you probably will have received in due time. In-  closed I send you now â€”  No. 1. Registers of meteorological observations for seven months,  viz : from June to December, 1857, inclusive.  No. 2. A table showing by the length of horizontal lines at what  time of the day it rained at Colonia Tovar for each day from June to  December, 1857, inclusive.  No. 3. A table containing a recapitulation of the occurrence of  rain expressed in number of hours, for all the months from July,  1856, to December, 1857, from 6 a. m. to 10 p. m. This table also  shows by the length of straight lines the comparative value for  each month, as regards the number of hours of rain ; and in another  diagram the mean rain value for each hour from 6 a. m. to 10 p. m.  It may not be uninteresting here to see what a symmetrical figure  the curve a b c represents ; how it rises gradually from 6 a. m. to the   METEOEOLOGY. 223  hour between 2 and 3 p. m., and tlien sinks to 10 p. m. nearly as  gradually as it rose.  No. 4. A table giving the course of the clouds of the higher, mid-  dle, and lower strata for the months of June to December, 1857.  The motion of the clouds from the E., E.SE., 8E., S.SE., and S. is  by far the most prevailing, amounting to 415, while the motions from  all the other eleven points amount only to 133. November and De-  cember show, as usually, a preponderance over the eight preceding  mouths with regard to motion of the clouds from the northern re-  gions. The motions from the west, with only one exception, took  place in the highest regions of the atmosphere. This puts me in  mind of the fact that, while at Santa Fe, New Mexico, the steady  course of the higher clouds from the west had frequently attracted  my attention.  No. 5 gives a view of the fluctuation of the mean daily heights of  the barometer for seven months. My remarks in a former letter about  the falling and rising of the mean daily height of the barometer,  which from one maximum to another requires, on an average, 4| days,  still hold good, as will be seen by the following series of numbers,  which are the number of days counted from one maximum height to  the next following one.  Beginning with my earliest barometrical observations, counting  from the 14th of June, 1856, and ending with the 30th of October,  1856, the day on which the barometer got out of order, we have: 5,  4, 5, 3, 5, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 4, 3, 4, 6, 10, 5,  5, 5 = 128 days, of which the mean is 4.57 days.  JL3eginning again, when the barometer was put into use, with the  12th of November, 1856, and ending with the 30th of April, 1857,  the day on which the barometer was taken apart to be mended, we  get : 6, 5, 2, 5, 6, 4, 4, 3, 6, 4, 6, 3, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 7, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 6,  6, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6, 5, 5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 4, 2 = 169 days, of which the mean  is 4.45 days.  Beginning again, when the barometer was in good order, with the  13th of Mav, 1857, and ending with the 31st of December, 1857, we  get: 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 4, 8, 4, 4, 5, 3, 4, 7, 2, 5,  4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 5, 2, 4, 4, 2, 5, 3, 7, 7, 5, 4, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 10, 8, 6,  6, 3 ^ 230 days, of which the mean is 4.51 days.  The mean of all these three series is 4.51 days.  No. 6 contains the half-hourly observations on the daily periodical  variations of the barometer for 157 days, which, together with those  made from the 10th of May to the 10th of Juno, amount to 186 days,  including more than 2,000 half-hourly observations of the barometer.  Duiing these seven months* I was, if I may use the expression, \" liv-  ing under the clock ;\" for I had to keep a continual lookout for the  arrival of the moment when one half hour after another would be up.  How often was I interrupted in my out-door manual labors in order  to attend to these observations ! And but the desire to help carry a  few useful materials towards the building ground of the great struc-  ture of meteorology, which no doubt one day will be reared in all its  perfection, could keep me at work with patience unwearied. I should  have continued these half-hourly observations still longer, but my   224 METEOROLOGY.  other engagements multiplied so much that I fonnd it utterly impos-  sible to do 80. The clock I used is a first rate time-piece, and was  compared, from time to time, with the meridian line laid down by  observation of the north star.  No. 7 contains the mean barometrical height* of all the half-hourly  observations made in 1857, recapitulated chiefly from table No 6, to  \"which are added the monthly means of the barometer at 7 a. m.,  2 p. m., and 9 p. m. These latter means are not the means of the  tvhole months, but of those days only on which half-hourly observa-  tions have been made.  No. 8 exhibits the curves of mean height of the barometer in its  course from 7 a. m. to 9 p. m., laid down according to the numbers  in table No. 7. We find these curves to be much more regular, and  more gradually and smoothly rounded off in proportion to the number  of days, of which they are the mean result. So is, for instance, the  curve c, resulting from the mean of eight months, more smoothly  rounded than the curve of the month of August or that of May ; and  these again more smoothly rounded than the curves resulting from  single days, which I have sent in my previous communications to you,  and whicii are more or less angular.  The curve c in diagram No. 8 may therefore serve to illustrate the  true and normal course of the periodical rise and fall of the barome-  ter from 7 a. m. to 9 p. m. Its rise and fall from 9| to 11 a. m.,  and from 4 to 5 p. m., are very inconsiderable ; butfrom 1 to 2| p. m.,  and from 7 to 9 a. m., far more rapid. There exists also a dilference  in the shape of the curve of the month of August compared with that  of the month of May.  No. 9 contains the mean amplitudes of the barometer, calculated  from table No. 6, for periods fi'om six to six successive days; also, the  mean am])litudes for periods from 12 to 12 days, and likewise those  for the different months. All these mean amplitudes are laid down  in diagram No. 10, in their proper position, according to their numeri-  cal value.  No, 10. The monthly means in the first curve exhibit a pretty  regularly rounded curve. The second curve, that is, the curve of the  twelve daily means, is somewhat more irregular. The third, or six  daily' curve, is still more irregular, exhibiting many projecting  corners. The fourth and lowermost, which can no longer be called  a curve, and of which, to save time, I have given only a small portion,  exhibits in a striking manner the great fluctuation of the daily am-  plitudes.  At first view there seems to be not the^ least tendency in them to  follow a certain law with regard to their mean value. This law,  however, becouies apparent, when we look at the next curve above,  and still more so in the two uppermost curves. The third curve  shows, also, that the nature of the curve of mean amplitudes is not  the same in every year ; in 1857, for instance, it is much higher from  October to December than it was in LS56. All this indicates plainly  enough that the daily amplitudes of the barometer are subject to  great disturbances by -some cause or other.  Great as the irregularities caused by such disturbances are in tlie   METEOROLOGY. 225  above curve, they do not invalidate the view I advanced in a former  letter about the nature of this cuive, as it ought to be in its normal  value. In their main features both coincide, if we make due allow-  ance for the short period during which these observations have been  continued. The curve in diagram No. 10 having its first maximum  near the 18th of May, its minimum near the 8th of July, and its  second maximum near the 2*7th of October, and if we were to draw a  mean line between the heights of 1856 and 1857, the second maximum  would be near the 3d instead of the 27th of October.  No. 11. In order to compare the course of the morning temperature  of Colonia Tovar with that of some place of the southern part of the  United States, I have in diagram No. 11 laid down in dotted line the  course of the temperature at 7 a. m. for the different days of March,,,  1852, as observed by me at Memphis, Tennessee, with the same ther-  mometer with which I made my first observations at Colonia Tovar.  The other line is the course of temperature at 7 a. m. for the different  days of March, 1857, at Colonia Tovar.  Besides the regular observations specified above, I have made from  time to time, just as occasion offered, memoranda on many other me-  teorological subjects which came under my observation. These memo-  randa were made either at the time of observation or immediately  after. They are rather numerous, and for want of time I am unable  at present to arrange them properly, or to make a selection from  among them.  I may^ however, afford so much time as to give the following :  July 27. In pre}taring for a journey to La Victoria, I rose early in  the morning. At 4^ a. m. there was a dense fog. Intending to step  out, and opening the kitchen door which leads into the open air, I  saw the sprightly burning kitchen fire reflected from the fog as from  a white, smooth, and solid wall ; and, besides this, a halo of about  twenty feet diameter, as plain and well defined as I ever saw around  the moon. This halo, with the reflected fire in its centre, appeared  to be close before me in a vertical plain, and it changed its position  whenever I changed mine, either to the right or to the left.  At a first superficial glance upon the map it may seem as if the  northern coast of Venezuela, on account of its great distance, can have  nothing to do with the climate of the United States, or that the me-  teorology of the two countries can have no feature common to both ;  but observation proves it to be otherwise. And if we take a more  comprehensive view of this vast region, we see that the Mexican gulf,  together with the Caribbean sea, is nothing more than a great inland  sea basin with numerous and spacious entrances to the northeast and  east. Five States of the Union forming its northern shore ; Venezuela,  New Grenada, and Central America, its opposite or southern shore.  Here I may also remark about the Venezuelan mountain range of the  coast, that its northern declivity towards the sea is generally very  steep, and in many places near its crest bearing marks of immense  masses of its body having sunk on that side far below its original  level, while on the other or southern side, no such marks are visible.  If we want to study in Venezuela the mutual influence of atmos-  pheric currents of these two opposite shores, viz : The southern coast  15 s   226 METEOROLOGY.  of the United states, and the northern of Venezuela^ we must not try-  to do it on that low and extremely narrow strip of land, which, bor-  dering the sea, stretches along the foot of the mountain chain running  east and west, parallel with the seashore. This low and narrow strip  of land has a climate of its own widely different from that of the Uni-  ted States. But when we take our abode on or near the top of the  mountain ridge where we are above the steady eastern trade winds, ,  and find ourselves in quite a different set of atmospheric currents, and I  if we then pay particular attention to the more violent northerly â–   winds, which now and then blow in this region, and to the great ;  southerly current, which lowers gradually in its course, reaches the :  surface of the sea somewhere between latitude 16\"^ and 26Â° north, and  generally blows steady during a great part of the summer and fall of  the year up the Mississippi valley, even beyond latitude 39Â° north ;*  we then will recognize in the moisture-laden southeastern, as well as  in the dry and chilling northwestern, by their very peculiarities, their  namesakes of the United States.  It is but five or six times a year that I am fortunate enough to get  hold of a few newspapers in these mountain solitudes, and it is seldom  that they contain anything regarding the weather of the United  States. However, I have read, only a few days ago, in a New York  paper of August 22, 1857, the following:  \"A private letter from New Orleans states that up to the 18th  instant, it had rained there every day for thirty-eight days consecu-  tively, and was still raining.\"  Now, by referring to my register of meteorology I find a singular  coincidence between the occurrence of rain at New Orleans and Colonia  Tovar. The inclosed table No. 2 exhibits this more strikingly, for  we see here at once, that of all the seven months there is no other  equally long period that can compare with the period (rom July 18,  to August 20, with regard to the number of rainy hours.  The following sentence from the Weekly Herald of September 5,  1857:  \" From New Mexico. The season has been unusually dry and cold,  and the crops look very badly. So little rain has fallen that the little  stream near Santa Fe is dried up,\" shows that the rain-spending  southeast current of the atmosphere, which soaked in the month of  August the soils of Colonia Tovar and New Orleans, never was felt at  Santa Fe, New Mexico ; and that there is a closer correspondence  between the aereal strata of the coast of Venezuela and the lower ones  of Louisiana, than between those of Louisiana and those of Santa Fe,  although the distance in a straight line between the two former places  is more than double the distance between New Orleans and Santa Fe.  Again, we find in the Weekly Herald of January 17, 1857 :  \" A terrific hurricane swept over the city and harbor of Vera Cruz  on the 20th of December,\" and \" a heavy northerly gale had prevailed  for several days previous to the 25th of December (at Havana.\")  My meteorologicul register of Colonia Tovar shows, on the 17th of  * While living at St. Louis, Missouri, I had a good opportunity to notice, during several  years, in July, August, and September, a steady southerly breeze almost day after day. In  some years, however, this wind blows less regular than in other years.   METEOROLOGY. 227  December, 1856, at 7 a. id., north wind, 4.; on the 19th, at 7 a.m., clouds  from the north, 4. ; on the 20th, at 7 a. m,, clouds trom the north, 3. ;  at 9 p. m., clouds from the north, 4. Number 4, as an indication of  force attached to the winds or the clouds is extremely rare in the  register for Colonia Tovar, and therefore denotes something extraor-  dinary. The mean barometer height was remarkably low on the ] 9th,  20th, and 23d of December, vid : diagram of mean barometer height  for 1856.  I could, no doubt, cite many more instances of this kind if I had  the means to know what is going on in other parts of the world.  To make observations in this country about the higher strata of the  atmosphere and their motions, no place, I should think, would be  more adapted than the mountains of Merida, which are said to reach  the line of perpetual snow. There we have a gigantic range of snow-  capped mountains stretching from southwest to northeast. Its base is  washed on one side by the warm waters of the gulf of Maracaybo, that  great arm of the sea, which runs far inland, and expands in a vast  basin near the mountains. On the other side lie^ in near approach,  those immense, level, grassy plains, the Llanos of Venezuela, which  are but slightly elevated above the level of the sea, and entirely bare  I of forest.  When in the dry season the sun, unobstructed by clouds, acts upon  the extensive sheet of the already very warm water of the gulf, with  all the power of its nearly vertical rays, the quantity of vapor carried  into the air by evaporation must be immense, while at the same time^  : on the opposite side of the mountains, the rarified strata of the atmos-  ' phere vibrate over the dry and burning hot surface of the llanos as  ! over a heated furnace.  I The phenomena which the different strata of air under such cir-  j cumstances must exhibit would, I think, form a worthy and highly  ; interesting subject of study for the meteorologist, and tend to advance  ' the cause of his science. Happy he who has the means and the mind  j to do so !  i In connection with the foregoing, I will mention only one phenom-  i enon, near the lake of Valencia, which may show some of the effects  : of evaporation with regard to its disturbance of the atmosphere.  As otten as I have visited Valencia in the dry season I have ob-  served a violent northerly wind, amounting sometimes to a very stiff  breeze, blowing there late in the afternoon till 10 or 11 o'clock at  night. I found this same wind also in other parts of the valley of  Aragua near the lake of Valencia, as, for instance, in Cagua and San  Jose.  I By inquiry I learned that this is a regular wind, commencing and  i; ending with the dry season, returning every year as regularly as the  I season itself; that it rises every afternoon, continues till late at night,  : and is very annoying to the inhabitants by the dust it raises.  [ By reterring to Humboldt's Travels I find the following sentence^  } where he speaks about the site of the town of Valencia: \" liut there  1 is an opening on the meridian of Nueva Valencia, which leads towards  the coast, and by which a cooling sea breeze penetrates every evening   228 METEOROLOGY.  into the valleys of Aragua. This breeze rises regularly two or three  hours after sunset.\"  Now, here we see that this phenomenon was as regularly exhibited  fifty-seven years ago as it is now, and no doubt has been going on  from time immemorial. The same causes that were then at work are  still at work as forcibly as ever. While at Valencia the slapping of  the doors, the columns of dust that came sweeping by, and other |  signs of a violent rush of wind indicated to me with unfailing cer- .|  tamty that it was after 3 or 4 p. m. Travellers and muleteers, in ij  going from Valencia to Puerto Cabello, are especially annoyed on the i\\  first six miles of their road by the dust, so that they have to cover â€¢  their faces or shut their eyes most of the time.  It was natural for me to reflect upon the probable cause of this phe- â€¢  nomenon, and a circumstance soon presented itself to help me towards i  the solution of this problem.  For on the 11th of March the sky was densely clouded, all day, over â–   Valencia, and the whole valley of Aragua, including the lake, and it  looked as if it was going to rain. In the evening, the usual regular â€¢  wind failed to make its appearance altogether.  To account for the alternating daily land and sea breezes of the ;  coasts in general, there exists a well-known explanation, based upon  the rarefaction of the air by the heated surface of the land or water.  This explanation, however, will not do in the above case ; for at Va-  lencia the wind begins to blow from the seaside not in the niorning,  when the land becomes heated, but, on the contrary, in the afternoon  when the land begins to cool again.  When in equatorial regions the direct rays of the sun act for some '  time upon a widely spread mass of water, surrounded by land, as, for  instance, a lake, they evaporate powerfully the water from its surface ;  that is, they convert a liquid into an aeriform fluid. In this latter  state the water requires several hundred times more room and exerts a  certain pressure which added to the pressure of the atmosphere,* with  which this vapor is mixed, overpowers the surrounding dryer atmos-  phere, and spreads or shoves the latter outward in nil directions to )  make room for itself. In such an atmosphere, saturated with invisible :  vapor, its permanent gases are much more attenuated than when im  a dry state ; but they nevertheless exert, by the aid of the invisible â–   vapor, an overwhelming outward pressure.  That amount of pressure, however, which tlie vapor exerts, can be  easily annihilated by condensation, and thereby a partial vacuum be  produced, into which the external air will strive to rush with great I  force.  Now, in the surrounding bottom lands of the lake, the air loses  towards evening, in the dry season, by radiation against an unclouded I  sky, more caloric than it receives.  It therefore seems highly probable, that the gradual decrease of'  temperature, by which the vapors of the air above the lake of Valencia  lose part of their tension, is the cause of the r egular breeze which  * Accordino- to the great fundamental principle, that in any given space, the power of ten-  sion of two or more mixed aeritorm bodies is equal to the sum of all those tensions which  each of these aerial bodies would exert, if it was to occupy the whole space by itselt.

It is easy to imagine what a hurricane would blow  if the cooling and condensing of the vapors were to be very sudden.  What interesting barometrical and other observations could be made  in the neighborhood of this lake!  Very frequently at night or evening, throughout the rainy season,  we may observe, at Colonia Tovar, favored by the absence of daylight,  flashes of lightning unaccompanied by any audible noise of thunder.  This noiseless discharge of electricity shows itself also frequently in  the daytime ; but of all the many discharges of lightning during a  three and a half years' residence I have heard only once or twice  thunder loud enough to be compared with those of the United  States.   230   METEOROLOGY.   â€¢a  e  a  ta  OJ  â€¢a  \"a    â€¢aojo^j      (?Â»         !

Under date of January 10- I sent you my meteorological registers  for Colonia Tovar, for seven months ending with the last day of De-  cember, 1857, besides some other observations on the meteorology of  that region.  The inclosed registers, which I send you this time, extend from the  1st of January to the 5th of June, 1858, for Colonia Tovar, and from  the 16th to the 30th of June for Caracas.  On the 6th of June, after having sold my little property, I left  Colonia Tovar, the place where I had lived for more than four years,  and moved to Caracas. I am very sorry to say that on this journey,  in endeavoring to measure some of the highest points of the difficult  and dangerous mountain road, the barometer was accidentally broken,  and hence the barometrical observations end with the 5th of June.  In February last I attempted to make a complete set of half-Jiourly  barometrical observations, but after proceeding with this task for  seven days I was compelled to leave off for want of time. The pres-  sure of business at present also prevents me from sending anything  more on meteorology this time.  A. FENDLEP   264   METEOROLOGY.       ....

' THE CUMATE OF SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, BY THOMAS M. LOGAN, M. D.  Latitude SS'i 3i' 41\" N, Longitude 12 1Â° 27' 44\" W.  As supplementary to the abstract of meteorological observations for  il8o3, 1854, and 1855, published in the reports of the Smithsonian  Institution, the accompanying tables for 1856-'57, together with the  results of the aggregate five years, have been prepared.  It may not meet the exactions of a rigid science to deduce a positive  view of the climate from a series of observations extending through  only five years, still an approximation may now be arrived at that  \"will be sufficiently near to afford a very just appreciation of some of  the climatic features of this portion of the great valley of the Sacra-  mento, due allowance being made for irregularities and disturbing  causes. Owing chiefly to the difficulty of procuring reliable instru-  ments and proper tables and instructions, the records, which were  made in various forms and with differing calculations, required re-  arrangement and tabulation to render them comparable with each  other. These considerations will be a sufficient apology with those  who have much experience in arranging statistical tables for a certain  amount of inaccuracy which has crept into our former publications.  In the present instance we have used every possible precaution while  rectifying former errors,* which are herewith specified, that the advan-  tages already received may be rendered more valuable hereafter.  BAROMETER.  The series of barometric observations have not been, in one respect,  continuous. Had they been conducted with one and the same instru-  ment doubtless some valuable deductions might have been gathered  from their analysis ; as it is we can only note some of the most obvious  â–  results. During 1853 the'ordinary ship barometer, (the only one to  be had then,) which was used, appears to have ranged entirely too  |low. The readings from this instrument, as well as those which were  registered from a common open cistern, and a siphon of Gay Lussac,  â€¢ Errata in former ptiblications. â€” The latitude and longitude of Sacramento are correctly  given above, and are erroneous in the previous reports.  1853.â€” Car.

During 1856 and 1857 Green's  Smithsonian barometer was employed, and its readings reduced to 32Â°  Fahrenheit. No correction for altitude was ever made, as the cisterns  of the various instruments employed were at so small an elevation  above the level of the sea. Neither was the elastic force of vapor  applied at the time of the record. This force has been calculated only  during the past year, according to the rules established by Regnault  for deriving every degree of it exhibited in the atmosphere from the  readings of the wet and dry-bulb thermometers. It will be seen that  it increases directly with the temperature, and amounted during 1857  to nearly half an inch during midsummer, or one sixty-seventh of the  entire atmospheric weight.  The absence of either abrupt or great changes gives indication of  the tropical feature which the climate possesses. As a general rule  the atmospheric pressure varies but little, and that through slow and  long continued movements, rather than in the sudden manner charac-  teristic of the latitude on the Atlantic coast and elsewhere. Never-  theless, although the mercurial column rises and falls within very  restricted limits, yet there are changes, represented it is true by small  measurements, which occur with wonderful regularity and certainty,  diurnal movements at fixed hours, as well as annual ones, having  reference to the position of the sun in the ecliptic. The former, or  horary oscillations, as revealed on the chart of diurnal barometrical  curves, present, in a marked degree, the two diurnal maxima and  minima observed within the tropics; the ante-meridian maximum, at  about 9 to 10 a. m., being more constant than that at the same period  post meridian. Without a single exception the pressure is always  less at 3 p. m., and this has no reference to whether the column stands  high, as in the cold, or low, as in the hot season.  The following table, calculated from the horary observations, taken  once a month during 1857, gives the mean successive hourly range for  the year. The signs -|- and â€” denote the range of each hour above  or below the mean of the twenty-four hours.

The mean successive daily range frequently, in summer, does not  amount to more than the ninety-four thousandth part of an inch.

Between the highest mean mensual mean and the lowest a  fraction over one-fifth of an inch is found. The extreme ranges  observed during the month are also limited, as may be seen in the sub-  joined table for 1857, wherein is also revealed the annual tide shown  in the chart of curves ; gradually descending as the sun approaches the  northern tropic, and ascending as he returns towards the southern.*   January 0.633  February 0.713  March 0.571  April 0.427  May -. 0.433  June 0.404   July 0.349  August 0.401  September 0.411  October 0.526  November 0.590  December 0.641   The extreme annual ranges are also small. During 1853 the maxi-  mum height of the barometer occurred in November and December,  and read 28.980, giving the difference as the extreme annual range of  1.460 inch. This, however, is the result of an extreme minimum,  never before nor since observed. A more reliable and the next lowest  minimum was 29.380 inches, observed with G-ay Lussac's siphon ba-  rometer on the morning, 1st January, 1855, before daylight, during  a strong gale from the SE. The greatest mensual range was also  observed in the same month, the maximum for the year having  reached 30.410 inches in the same month, and giving a difierence of  1.030 inch for the month as well as for the year The lowest read-  ing for the same year was 29.569 inches on the 19th September. The  extreme annual range was therefore 1.050 inch. These instances of  extreme range are very rare, and must be regarded as exceptional.  The extreme range for 1854 was only 0.850, and that of 1857 but  0.783 inch. During the rainy season northerly winds always deter-  mine the greatest elevation, and southerly the greatest depression of  the mercurial column. This rule is not so constant during the dry  season.  * The mean for July of the series is higher than that of June, in consequence of some  peculiar disturbing causes in June, 1853, which year should be regarded as exceptional, and  which may in part be attributable to a defective instrument.

These  phenomena bear the closest analogy with those observed at Algiers,  Oran, and other localities on the southern shores of the Mediterranean,  as established by A. Mitchell, A. M., M. D.*  THERMOMETER.  Like the barometer the thermometer reveals also some features of a  tropical rather than the temperate climate, to which latitudinally Sac-  ramento appertains. The mean monthly and annual temperatures,  as seen in the accompanying tables, are calculated, like those of the  barometer, from the daily observations made at 7 a. m., 2 p. m., and  9 p. m. This arithmetical mean is found to differ occasionally from  that obtained from the thermometrograph during the last two years.  The minimum temperature, as seen from the curves projected in the  chart of hourly observations, occurs between 4 and 5 a. m., and the  maximum about 3 p. m. Consequently the mean deduced from the  latter is generally minus that of the former. The following table  gives the correction to be applied in order to obtain the absolute mean:  * British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review, No. xxxiii, 1856.   288   METEOROLOGY.   Date.   1857.

For this reason we have not applied the correction  to our tables, but purpose prosecuting the series of hourly observa-  tions ; and with a view to uniformity hereafter will adopt the term  days, commencing at 10 p. m.s mean time, Gottingen, on the Friday  preceding the last Saturdays of February, May, August, and Novem-  ber, and on the Wednesdays nearest the 21st of each of the other  months. Another and most important object in this connexion will  be the determination of the hours of mean temperature. As will be  seen in the table subjoined, the measures of the critical interval are so  from corresponding with the quantity obtained in all other localities,  and which are generally so near as to amount almost to a constant,  that the two times of the day at which the mean temperature occurs  can only be regarded as approximative.

Howsoever high the  wave of temperature towers up under the influence of a vertical sun  and cloudless sky, it sinks proportionately low during the night,  rendering it conl and chilly. As an instance of the reliability and  freedom from exaggeration of the curves of temperature in this respect,  we would remark that the record of the thermometrograph for July,  1857, reveals a range of 41 degrees, and a mean daily range of 18.68'.  degrees, while the chart of diurnal observations describes a curve of.  only 24 degree-.

The difference of the means of the hottest and  coldest months between summer and winter is also shown to be  24Â°. 25, and the extreme variation_, or the difference between the mean  maxima of the former and the mean minima of the latter, 41Â°. 50.  It will be noticed that in our division of the seasons we have, in  accordance with the phenomena observed, defined February as the  first of the three spring months, and appropriated five months to  summer, and only two to autumn, and two to winter. Indeed, the  dormant season is of so short duration that the tropical division into  the wet and dry seasons would perhaps be more appropriate. The  whole period of sensible winter is far from being a complete season of  suspension of vegetation. During the period we have assigned to it  many forms of vegetable life are still active ; particularly the roots of  grasses and winter grains. The lowest mean daily temperature  belonging to this period is seldom below 40Â°. Although the ther-  mometer has been known to fall as low as 33Â° as late as the 10th of  February, still the leafing process generally commences during the  first week of February and is completed at a temperature not much   292 METEOEOLOGY.  exceeding that of the mean annual. Sometimes a greater degree of  cold is experienced in March than in February, and at other times  spring is as well advanced in March as at other seasons it is in May.  In 1855 the mean temperature of May was 3Â° lower than that of  April, 1857, notwithstanding, the distribution of heat for the three  months of spring is marked by no great variability in successive years,  nor great constant diiferences of the mouths. The measure ol' heat  increases very gradually from month to month. Indeed, the same  uniformity of temperature is found to obtain throughout all the  meteorological seasons. In summer the greatest vicissitudes of tem-  perature are found to occur, as is readily seen in the subjoined table  for 1856 and 1857. The commencement of autumn is quite similar  to the beginning of spring in its mean of daily temperature. The  earth remaining warmer than the atmosphere under the decline of  temperature, activity is partially renewed after the drought of summer  by the influence of the light early showers of October. The first frosts  occur about the middle of November, and the decline into winter is  prolonged until the latter part of December. Ice is seldom formed  before the beginning of January, and then rarely remains unthawed  for 24 consecutive hours. As a physical constant it is a matter of  some difficulty to place within 5Â° of different latitudes isothermal  lines for the seasons. That of 60Â° for the spring, designed for the  United States Army Meteorological Register, which connects Sacramento  with Beaufort, North Carolina, on the Atlantic coast^ and San Diego,  on the Pacific, curves 5Â° 52' latitude to the south on arriving at  the latter point. A corresponding divergence to the north occurs  during the winter. The isochimenal line of 45Â°, which is common to  Beaufort, North Carolina, and Sacramento, describes a northerly curve  of 8Â° 03' latitude before reaching the Pacific at Port Orford, Oregon,  latitude 42Â° 44'; the mean annual temperature of which place is only  53Â° 6'. The isotheral of 70Â°, starting from latitude 40Â° on the  Atlantic side, comes out on the Pacific coast on the parallel of 30Â°.  The great curvature to the south on the Pacific coast during spring  and summer demonstrates one of the peculiarities of the distribution  of heat in this region. For the mean of the three months of spring  the sea temperature which predominates on the line of coast westward  of the coast range of mountains is strikingly uniform, and shows but  little, if any, advance on that of winter. Indeed, the same may be  said of the summer months. For some hundreds of miles on the 40th  parallel there is very little difference in the sea temperature for the  entire year, and the cold of the Pacific in summer extends, according ,  to the Army Register, from the 50th to the 30th parallel. Thus  while the extremes of summer heat are common to the whole valley  of the Sacramento and San Joaquin, the mean summer temperature  of San Francisco is only 60Â°, and there is only one day recorded I  among the observations of Dr. Henry Gibbons when the temperature  rose above 79Â° during the summer months.

Hygrometry , Wind, Hail, Snow, Electrical and other Phenomena.  An examination of the results of the psychrometer will reveal the  peculiar state of the atmosphere during the summer months. So great  is the apparent aridity at times that the lower asrial strata are fre-  quently found to contain during the hottest part of the day not more  than 15 to 20 per centage of their capacity for moisture. As an iso-  lated and extreme case, on the 10th July, 1856, at 2 p. m., wind  N. and light, and temperature 100Â°, the dew-point was found at  22Â°. This, we believe, is the greatest dryness that has yet been ob-  served on the surface of the globe on low lands. Humboldt, in his  Cosmos, states that the greatest dryness he has observed was in the  steppe of Platowskaja, after a SW. wind had blown for a long time  from the interior of the continent. With a temperature of 74Â°. 07 he  found the dew-point at 24Â°, the air containing yVo^^^s of aqueous  vapor. The principal agent in this hygrometric peculiarity of the  climate is to be found in the direct effect of northerly winds. In the  winter and spring the north winds are the coldest and serve, as the  land is then cooler than the sea, on account of the distance of the sun,  to condense the moisture wafted with the atmospherical current from  the southern hemisphere, and to precipitate it in the form of rain.  During this season the southeast trades, charged to their utmost  capacity with moisture, commence descending as their temperature  decreases, and precipitate more and more rain as they become chilled  by the north winds. During the summer, owing to the fact of these  northerly winds passing over a highly heated and arid surface, their  temperature is raised, thereby increasing their capacity for moisture,  which not being able to obtain from the surface passed over, they  appear as dry winds, reminding one of the reputed sirocco of Italy.  Nevertheless, dry as these winds apparently are, on coming in contact  with the westerly winds chilled by the oceanic polar current along the  coast, and their temperature being again reduced, the vapor they con-  tain is rapidly condensed ; hence the heavy mists that are precipitated  during the afternoon at San Francisco and at the gaps along the coast.  In the valley, as a general rule, the direction of the wind is from  north by west to southeast. It seldom blows from the east or north-  east with any appreciable force. Doubtless the prevailing wind off  the coast, where no causes of local deflection exist, is west, as estab-  lished by Lieut. Maury. This wind, rushing into the heated valleys  through the gap at San Francisco and Benicia, reaches us at Sacra-  mento and the northern part of the valley as a southwest wind, while  at Stockton and the San Joaquin valley it is a westerly and north-  westerly wind. To this wind, together with that descending from  the slopes of the sierras, may be attributed our cool summer nights.  The influence of the winds on the temperature, as we have just seen  with respect to the hygrometric condition of the air, varies according  to the season of the year. It is during the occurrence of northerly  winds in the summer that we experience our hottest weather, which  seldom lasts long, however, before the temperature becomes equalized  by a change of wind to the southward. Upon an examination of our  daily and hourly records we find it to be a common occurrence during   METEOROLOGY. 235  the summer months for the wind to commence blowing from the north  at or shortly after the morning observation, and to remain in this  quarter until afternoon, when it would change round to the south,  freighted with moisture and invigorating freshness. It is the preva-  lence of these cool winds which temper our summer climate so delight-  fully, the greater or less predominance of which renders the mean  temperature plus or minus.  As regards the force of the wind, it is generally but slight. The  observations in this respect having been registered for the two last  years only it is impossible to make full deductions therefrom with  any degree of completeness. The following enumeration of the fre-  quency, course, and seasons of winds, during 1856 and 1857, stronger  than (3) a fresh breeze, will afford some idea of this feature of the  climate.  The whole number of times it blew with the force of four, (4,) or  what is estimated a strong wind, from the north, was 29, viz : Janu-  ary, three times ; February, five times ; March, once ; April, four  times ; June, once ; September, three times ; October, twice ; Novem-  ber, eight times ; and December, twice Eighteen times it blew from  the south with the force of four, (4,) viz : January, once ; August,  twice ; September, four times ; October, three times ; November, four  times; and December, four times. It blew only eight times with the  force of (5) a high wind, viz : three times from the north, once  in February, once in April, and once in November ; and again five  times from the south, viz : once in January, once in October, once in  November, and twice in December. But twice does it appear in the  register to have blown a gale, (6,) and on both these occasions it was  from the southeast, in the month of November. These results, as be-  fore stated, are derived from the record of the last two years. Prior  to this no precise estimate was made of the force of the wind. The  only time it was ever observed during the whole series of five years  to blow with a force above six was on the last night of the year 1854,  or rather on the morning of the 1st of January, 1855, when a strong  gale from the southeast, attended with rain, was experienced. As a  general rule, it very rarely rains with the wind from the northern half  of the octant, which may be attributed to its coming to a warmer from  a colder region. During the last five years there have occurred only  fifteen exceptions to this rule, and the aggregate quantity that fell at  these different periods does not amount to two inches. On one occa-  sion, the 27th of December, 1855, the snow which fell at daylight,  amounting, when melted, to 0.016 inches by the rain gauge, was added  to the amount. This was the heaviest fall of snow ever experienced ;  indeed only three other instances of this phenomenon appear on our  record, and in all three the fall was very light. Hail storms are more  common. These, also, are of short duration, and are attended with  more or less disturbance of the electrical equilibrium. The breaking  up of the rainy season is the period of the most violent manifestations  of these latter phenomena. With the exception of the spring of 1857,  which was a season of drought, hail and thunder storms have invari-  ably occurred during the months of April and May, but have never  been very severe in this immediate locality. A hail storm which   296 METEOROLOGY.  occurred at a point witliin eight miles of the city, in May, 1854, is  represented to have been very violent. But we have experienced nothing  in this locality like that, proceeding from a dense nimbus, which sud-  denly arose from the southwest on the 13tli of May, 1855, and, while  discharging its watery contents, rivalled, in the vivid shocks, of its  well-charged battery, the thunder gusts of more tropical regions.  The aurora borealis has been observed only once â€” on the night of  the 16th of December, 1857 ; the sky being entirely clear at the time,  the wind light, from the east â€” the thermometer reading 44Â°, and the  barometer 30.321 inches, reduced for temperature. This phenomenon  first appeared in a northeast direction, in the form of a diffused light  defined by an arch below. From this arch, of about 15Â° radii above  the horizon, the light extended in width apparently 10Â° above Alioth,  in the constellation of the Great Bear, and gradually spread over the  whole northern section of the heavens, the dominant hue being deep  rose. Its aspect, however, was frequently changed by the successive  appearance and shifting of streaks or columns of white light, which  seemed to be more conspicuous at either extremity of the arch. With  the exception of a somewhat similar phenomenon seen once at Sonora,  Tuolumne county, during the winter of 1852-'53, we have heard of  no other instance of the aurora being seen in California.  Before proceeding to a consideration of the rains we would, in this  connexion, briefly refer to the transparency of the atmosphere for which  California has been noted. The relative frequency of clear and cloudy  days in summer and winter, as appears in the tables, although sub-  stantially correct, does not convey a just idea of the clearness of the  sky. The results are calculated from three daily observations; and if  it so happens that at either of these the least cloudiness is visible it  is recorded as a cloudy day, without regard to quantity. Now, one of  the peculiarities of the summer climate is, that if there be any cloud-  iness during the day, which is rarely the case, it is almost invariably  clear at night. Indeed, on this account, perhaps there is no region  better adapted to astronomical purposes ; for, as Sir David Brewster  expressed his wish^ \" no clouds disturb the serenity of the firmament,  and no changes of temperature distract the emanations of the stars.\"  As to the quantity of cloudiness, this not having been estimated pre-  viously to the last two years, of course the results in this respect can-  not be regarded but as approximative to a constant, the number of  cloudy days having been in excess during 1856 and 1857.  RIVER, RAINS, ETC.  The rise and fall of the river at Sacramento is graduated by the  terms high and low- water mark, or zero. A solid column, surmounted  with a wind -vane, was set up by the city near the river bank in Sep-  tember, 1856, when the river had attained the lowest stage ever  known. The fig. 2 in the accompanying hydrographic scale agrees  with the zero in our published observations up to that date. The  mean depth of the channel of the river in this neighborhood is 16 feet  below low-water mark, and the width of the river is about 300 yards.  There is a tidal rise and fall of about one to two feet at Sacramento,   METEOROLOGY. 297  according to the course and force of the wind and the stage of the  river. If the wind blows strongly from the north this fall is still  greater, especially during spring tides. The stage of the water is  also aftected by the temperature, as well as by the fall of rain. The  months of November, December, January, February, March, and  April constitute the \"rainy season,\" although more or less rain  generally falls during October and May. The first and generally the  greatest rise in the river occurs about the 1st of January, after the  early rains. The warmer these rains are the less snow falls in the  mountains, and consequently the more sudden is the rise of the river.  From the middle of January to the middle of February there is gene-  rally a marked abatement, and sometimes a complete suspension of  rain, and the river declines correspondingly. From the middle of  February to the last of April the latter or warmer rains set in, and  cause a second or spring rise, which is kept up in accordance with the  prevailing temperature. If the spring and early summer have been  cold, the spring freshet soon passes off, and the river maintains a  high level, as it did in 1857, in consequence of the gradual melting  of the snow at its sources ; and the converse obtaining if the hot  weather sets in early. Recurring to the hydrographic scale, we would  observe that the figures to the left indicate, when applied to the river,  the number of feet from zero or extreme low-water mark at spring  tide to the highest point the Siicramento has yet been known to rise,  viz : nearly 22 feet, in January, 1852. The curves for all the years  are not complete,, our notes not being full and regular. The same  scale of feet, if read for inches, when applied to the perpendicular  lines, will denote at a glance, and which is most important in this  connexion, the monthly quantity of rain that fell at Sacramento during  the last five years â€” the rain for 1853-'54 being placed in the first  column of each month, of 1855 in the second, and of 1856-'57 in the  third. The scale to the right represents inches, and is intended to  show the comparative annual fall of rain since the year 1852. As  will readily be seen, the rains during 1856-'57 have been so much  below the average that they should be regarded as exceptional.  Averaging the rains of 1852-'53-'54-'55, we find an annual fall  of 21,352 inches ; whereas the average of the last five years gives only  17.113 inches. In the rain chart of the Army Meteorological Regis-  ter, Sacramento is included with San Francisco in the area of 22 inches  of rain ; and Dr. Gibbons puts down the mean annual rain of the  latter place at 21.17 inches. This corresponds with our estimate of  the amount for Sacramento, and rather strengthens the opinion just  expressed, that the years 1856-'57 should be regarded as exceptional.  Although the river is, of course, but slightly affected by the amount  of rain that falls in this immediate vicinity, nevertheless the con-  nexion here preserved is of much interest, inasmuch as experience  shows that the amount of rain that falls at Sacramento bears a quan-  titative proportion to that which is precipitated in the higher parts of  the valley, as well as in the mc untains. Certainly, the river never has  attained a high stage when there has occurred a deficit of rain at  Sacramento. To substantiate these assertions the following facts,  condensed from our publications in the California State Medical   298 METEOROLOGY.  Journal, will suffice. As therein stated the winter and spring of  1849-'50 was a season of continual outpourings. The first settlers  tell us that the rain came down in torrents, and that tubs and casks  left out at night were found full and overflowing next morning. This  must, of course, be taken cum grano salis. There were no ombro-  meters in those mythical days, when the rain appears to have been as  abundant as the gold. Doubtless the rains were copious ; certainly  they set in earlier than they have ever done since. \" The first rain  of 1849 took place on the 23d of September. Through the month of  October they became much more severe and cold, and, as no adequate  preparation had been made for protection against this element, the  sufferings of the immigrants were consequently aggravated.\" *  * * '^' Through the latter part of December and beginning  of January, 1850, the rains were so heavy that serious apprehensions  began to be entertained, for the first time, of an inundation.\" *  * * \"By Christmas the water was over the lower portions  of the city ; on the 8th of January, 1850, it rose rapidly ; and on the  10th, and for several days after, there was no dry land in town, except  the knoll at the public square.\" * * * \" In a few days  the waters subsided, the sun broke from its cloudy confines and shone  bright and beautiful again. This weather continued until the heavy  rains of the following March.\" * * * '-On the 7th of  April the waters began again to run into the town, and on the 8th  the council voted an appropriation of money for constructing a tem-  porary levee, which was made, and the principal business portion of  the city saved from an overflow.\" â€” (History of the City.) The open-  ing half of the winter of 1850-'51, when commence our own observa-  tions, was rainless, and consequently the river remained at low -water  mark until January, 1851, during which month about three-fourths of  an inch of rain fell, and a corresponding rise in the river occurred.  From this period the river remained very low until April 5, when it  attained, although by no means a high level, still a greater elevation  than at any prior date of the season, and navigation continued open  to most of the upper trading points on the Sacramento, as well as to  Marysville, until the summer. The rains that fell during this inter-  val amounted to about 4 inches.  The rainy season of 1851-'52 commenced early, and the river rose  correspondingly. By the 30th December it was up to within 4 feet of  its natural banks, in consequence of the heavy rains which fell up to  that date, amounting in the aggregate, during September, October,  November, and December, to about 10 inches ; thus compensating, in  a measure, for the deficit of the previous season. The rain of the year  1852 was well distributed among all the months of the wet season,  and amounted in the aggregate to about 27 inches. The heaviest rains  occurred in March and December, and consequently the city was over-  flowed both these months, the levee not proving adequate. The first  of these inundations occurred on the 7th March, owing to the washing  away of the embankment at the flood-gate in the levee at Sutter lake,  as well as to a crevasse on the American river ; and for one week  nearly the whole city remained submerged. The rains which followed  after the great fire of November, 1852, were the heaviest known for   METEOROLOGY. 299  â€¢ that season of the year of which we have any positive record. About  i 12 inches fell in December. Accordingly the river rose 17 inches  ! higher than in the flood of 1850. From the 25th December to the  I 24th January, 1853, when the waters began to retire, the city re-  â€¢ mained almost entirely submerged. During the following March the  ! fall of rain amounted to 7 inches, and again a corresponding rise of  the river occurred. On the 29th it rose 12 feet in twenty-four hours,  '. and soon reached above the original banks ; and, backing up from a  I break in the levee at Sutterville, the greater part of the city was  I again overflowed by the 2d April, and thus remained more or less  t deluged until the rains subsided towards the last of May. The  amount of rain that fell during the latter month was nearly 1^ inch,  and the aggregate for January, February, March, April, and May,  and which kept up the river at so high a level, was about 17 inches.  From the period to which we have thus brought down our account  of the freshets of the Sacramento river and the corresponding rains,  up to the present time, (1st January, 1858,) there has been no ex-  traordinary rise to record, as may readily be seen by a glance at the  hydrographic scale. As may also be there seen, the rains during the  same interval have been considerably below the average.   300   METEOROLOGY.   ^   GO O â€¢<?â€¢   (n:c-i       03 00 00     -*)-   *-w   ^^   â€¢Â° m   c coirÂ»   in â€” oÂ«     â– ~t -^ 00   030 Cl    â€” Â£   . o o o           IE\"    S â€” -H O     â€” tt'o      1 M 1   tj+l     + 1    3-1 +  a    CO  1   5 3   â– ^   (^       q    1   <~             J O = â€” 1   8â€” im 33    000 000 in iCCOrJ\" t^ c!Â«-|Â«e.   n M CJ    S â€” !OCO   U 03C0 O    000 i^ a   3 â€” .-Â§10010   â€¢ CO   â€¢UB31V[   ^OCOO       33 CO t- a CD in in 01    be TO a; =    -1 00 00 :33 CO â€¢ â€¢   â– S C! â€”      H â€” â–  oj ai   CD t~ -T to    CO IT CO in c< -r   g    \"^    l^COIDSI   Q        \"^ 1    o,\" 133(^00   So = CD    000 ooin -wo-   J   tp to     Â£ =>o 00    000 00 CÂ« -criMC^ c^O3C}00   - <S   â€¢jaqiuaoad   .^ 3i~ (M   btT' (?i n    - â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 03 m 00 Â»> (N  Tji33in oooor- ... y   r- c, 1    ~ O 3J o\"   Â« OCg T    in c) (N IT C) CO   (^    a    t^cocico   Cl          J ^O -1   g O O 00    000 000 33 -- 00 . 0.   fn C   13 f-^    S ^ Â»i^ CO   S = o -<    000 oo-v couo^ M^coc:   3    â– j9qmaA0j^   ^co r- =   6>r-\" CO 'TJ    csTi^in m â€” ^ ... ^   CD CO     Cl    1^ ?o If ^5 rr   q      -/ T ^ ^   u o o -^    000 OO-^ C330O'n .

'^  a  The foregoing table for 1856 is the result of three daily observa-  tions, made at 7 a. m., 2 p. m., and 9 p. m., with the instruments  and instructions recommended by the Smithsonian Institution, The  readings of the barometer have been reduced to the temperature of  32^ Fahrenheit, but not to sea level. The height of the lower sur-  face of the mercury is 41 feet above the mean level of the sea at San  Francisco. The rainy days are included in the cloudy and foggy  days, and are also put separately to show the number of these days  on which rain fell every month. Professor Coffin's psychrometrical  table for determining the elastic force of aqueous vapor and the rela-  tive humidity of the atmosphere will be used in our register hereafter,  and the dew-point column omitted. The following corrections of '  errata are to be applied to our tables for 1853-'54, published in the  Smithsonian Report for 1855 : Barometer mean for September, 1853,  30.00, and mean mean 30.02 inches ; mean of barometer for January,  1854, 30.11 inches.  MONTHLY REMARKS.  January. â€” The means of the barometer and thermometer were above  the average of the three preceding years, the former by 0.254 inch,  and the latter by 3.59 degrees. The rainy days exceeded the average â–   to the number of seven. There were five days of more or less fog.  The quantity of rain was plus the average 1.460 inch. A sprinkle â–   of snow, just enough to be perceptible, occurred on the 8th at 9 a. m.  On the 3d frost remained all day unthawed in the shade.  February, â€” There was little variation in the atmospheric pressure  from that of previous years. The mean temperature was plus the  average by 1.14 degree. Spring opened early. On the 7th the wil-  low (Salix) flowered. On the 13th the buttercup^ and on the 16th  the wild violet were also in blossom. The rain fell short of the  average by 1.460 inch.  March. â€” The temperature exceeded the average still more this  month, being plus 3.12 degrees. Spring progressed rapidly. On the  Ist the peach was in full blossom, and on the 10th was leafed out.  Although the deficit of rain for the month amounted to 2.560 inches,  frequent showers, accompanied on the 29th by lightning and thunder,  tempered, in this locality, the effects of the drought which prevailed I  generally throughout the State.  April. â€” There was very little variation in the readings of the  barometer and thermometer from that of previous years. Seasonable  rains invigorated vegetation, and although nothing like the deficiency '  was made up, still the Sacramento river remained comparatively high  for the season, in consequence of the warm rains melting the snow.  Its temperature averaged about 54*^, being four degrees lower than  that of well water. The last frost of the season occurred on the 29th.  The barn swallow made its first appearance on the 1st, and toward  the latter part of the month wild geese were observed wending their   METEOEOLOGY: 303  way northwardly. At the last of the month salmon and sturgeon  began to ascend the river in considerable numbers.  May. â€” The average readings of the barometer and thermometer  did not vary much from those of the four preceding Mays. The pro-  longation of the wet season to the last of the month somewhat com-  pensated for the deficiency of the semestral fall of rain, which was  reduced down to 6.263 inches. On the evenings of the 6th, 8th, and  9th sheet lightning in the northern horizon revealed the time of  occurrence of terrific hail storms at various points at these respective  dates. Tiiat which occurred at Butte creek^ Shasta county, was  accompanied by a gale, the belt of which was not over half a mile in  width, and the extent of ground on which the largest sized hail fell  two miles. These hailstones were about the size of carbine balls, of  a nucleus of ice surrounded by snow, apparently. On the 21st snow  fell lower down on the foot hills than at any previous time during the  winter. The temperature of the river still remained 4 degrees lower  than that of well water, the current running at the rate of four miles  an hour.  June. â€” Throughout the whole month the weather was very variable.  Instead of the close, sultry atmosphere that usually obtains as the  sun enters the calm belt of Cancer, strong, chilly winds, varying from  SSW. to WNW., just at the period of the summer solstice, pre-  vailed, freighted with moisture from the ocean. As the land, how-  ever, had already attained a high degree of temperature, of course it  could not condense the vapors of water held by the air ; consequently  no rain fell after the 1st, when 0.033 inch are now chronicled as the  last for this extraordinary season. The total amount, therefore, of  rain for the season of 1855-'56, at Sacramento, was minus the average  4.264 inches The river continued to fall steadily. Its temperature  on the 2l8t was 4 degrees higher than that of well water 12 feet  below the surface, which fact showed that the great bulk of the  melted snow from the mountains had passed off.  July. â€” Notwithstanding the cloudless sky which characterized  nearly this whole month, the tempering of the atmosphere by fresh  southerly breezes was more obvious to one's feelings than by the ther-  mometer, the mean of which was only 0.60 minus the average of the  three preceding Julys. During the few days that northwardly winds  predominated the heat became intense. An important meteorological  fact connected with this unpleasant wind is that all the moisture has  been wrung out of it that a dew-point of zero in the cold latitudes  could extract. It is, indeed, a return wind, which, after blowing over  the surface fresh from the ocean, grows colder as it goes north, where  the process of condensation commences, and when it comes back it is  as parching and obnoxious to animal and vegetable life as the simoon  of the eastern deserts. The river reached a very low stage this month,  and its temperature at 12 feet below the surface read 75*^;, while well  water at the same depth was 66^.  August. â€” This last of the summer months closed after a remark-  ably cool summer . The whole number of days of extreme heat, in which  the thermometer reached 90Â° and upward, amounted to only 11 for  the summer, viz : two in June, six in July, and three in August. On   304 METEOKOLOGY.  the 26tli the temperature of the earth at 53 feet below the surface  (the depth then obtained in an artesian well) was 60Â°, the thermometer  having fallen about a degree and a half for every 10 feet from the  depth of 15 feet, at the time of reaching which latter depth it read 66Â°.  September. â€” This month was characterized by variable weather.  The barn swallow made its last appearance on the 5th. On the 10th,  at 5^ o'clock p. m., we were suddenly visited with a high wind fromi  a heavy bank of clouds in the southwest horizon, which at one time  presented indications of approaching rain, but was intercepted by the  arid mountains and high lands of Santa Cruz, Alameda, and Sam  Francisco, where the accompanying lightning and thunder are reported'  to have been extremely violent.  For several days previous to the equinox a regular declension of  atmospheric pressure was experienced, attended with a stagnant,  sultry condition of the air. This was succeeded by a sprinkle of rain  (the first of the season in this locality) at daylight on the 20th, when  the lowest reading of the barometer, as above, was recorded. As the  sun entered Libra, however, the weatlier presented one of the most i  favorable specimens of our autumnal climate, a fresh circulation of'  air being kept up by southerly breezes.  The most remarkable feature of the month was the brilliant ?erolite(  which appeared on the evening of the 11th, at about 8 o'clock. As â–   it was seen simultaneously in an area of several hundred miles,  bounded by Red Bluffs, Iowa Hill, Stockton, San Francisco, and i  Santa Cruz, the probabilities are that at the time of its brief appear-  ance it was in the upper regions of our atmosphere, and that, judging [  from the interval that elapsed between its explosion and the reaching  of the report here, which resembled distant thunder, its distance then  was between thirty and thirty-five miles. After comparing all the  different accounts that have reached us, it would seem that its course  was on the southern side of the zenith, from SE. to NW., and that  its relative position to the point of aspect here was at first about forty  degrees above the horizon, and twenty when it vanished. When first  seen it appeared but little larger than Venus, but as it approached i  the earth it increased in size as suddenly as it diminished again just t  before bursting into brilliant corruscations of light that reflected all I  the prismatic colors. The moon was near the close of ils second I  quarter at the time, and the atmosphere clear and transparent.  The Sacramento river fell to a lower point than has ever been before ;  observed, which will be the zero of the scale of a new river gauge  about to be constructed by the city. Its present mean temperature  twelve feet below the surface reads 70Â°, while that of well water at  the same depth is 60Â°. The temperature in the artesian well at  sixty-five feet below the surface is 59^^Â°.  October. â€” The mean temperature of this month was 5Â°. 47 minus  the average. On the 1st the flight of wild geese southwardly, which i  had been observed since the 8th September, prepared us to expect the  rain that fell on five different days â€” the 7th, 15th, 17th, 19th, and  24th ; and though not amounting to much in quantity, it was sufficient  to indicate that the atmospherical changes which characterize the  rainy season had set in. The first frost occurred on the 20th, and ice   METEOROLOGY. 305  S formed on the 22d, at daylight. The effect of the rains and snows  !was sensibly demonstrated in the Sacramento river, both quanti-  'tatively and thermometrically. On the 17th, it rose suddenly ten  finches, and fell again immediately to low water mark ; its temperature  â€¢ declining 12Â° lower than that of the previous month. The temperature  I of well water fell to 57Â°. On the last day of the month the leaves of  the willow began to fall.  November. â€” Although the readings of the barometer were not much  I below the average, more or less stormy weather prevailed over the  greater part of the State. In the south, the setting in of the rains  was attended by disasters of a somewhat novel character. A shower  of sand swept over a portion of Los Angeles county, completely de-  stroying the grass on the pasture lands About the same period,  severe gales prevailed at Humboldt Bay. The mornings of the 27th  and 30th were unusually cold for the season. The rains of the month  did not make much impression on the river, further than a rise of  about 9 inches ; its temperature was 46Â°, while that of well water was  59Â°. The temperature of the Artesian well, at 73 feet, where it was  discontinued, stood at 58Â°. 50. The fall of leaf of the fig, apple, pear,  and cotton-wood tree occurred on the 1st, 5th, and 30th dates of the  month respectively.  December. â€” The month was rendered remarkable for the unprece-  dented })ersistence of continuous cold weather and the number of cloudy  days â€” much beyond the average of the three previous years. The  barometer maintained an unusually high range in consequence of the  prevalence of northerly winds. The readings of its extraordinary  maxima were made on the evening of the 19th and morning of the  20th, while the wind was fresh from the N.NW., and the temperature  ranged from 30Â° to 40Â°. Its diurnal mean fell only five times below  30 inches. The minimum was registered on the 29t.h at 9 p. m., pre-  ceding a SE. storm which was general throughout the State. On the  same day it snowed at San Francisco, and about the same period the  Coast range of mountains presented the unusual appearance of being  covered with snow. The river was not much affected by the rains of  the month ; its temperature read 41Â°.   20 s   306   METEOEOLOGY.    fN Tf â€”   (^)^~c'    00 ooo   CO GO rt   (Tico r-    ^   CIi.-^   -^o(.i    <rj   1    cj â€” eÂ»  CJ f- OT   Â»~ â€” f~    o .ra It;      OS T -\"T   i~ 00 CD a 1        mcnc-     X C* TT t-\" OS 1   c    o as â– c <=    S?^^   00 CI r-     â€” 'CO-H    a   â– = oia   r~^ CO   u^co -cr     05C3 l-   \" \"^ CO d' [   p: oto)          ^H t             rt             C           H\"a(n    j=t   en oo lo   o o r^     CO   CO c2 n    m   o moo rtj   TTO CD   o o ?:     CD   ^ CJ IT    CÂ£   rHâ€” CO   s   Tf X> '-'       CO â€” c     CÂ£ CD     o r-^ i-^ J-    02 CI CO   05 e; c-     coo t-    OOJO   UO CO -^    HO CO d   â– r CO c;     enc3c~   â– Â«â€¢(Â»   3J   C3 oi :Â»5           o             ^           a-i\"!.-.    a   c*^ re o   rr        Ol   â€” \"oo O CO 1   CO 1^ CO   (N      osos oo    aa    O) CO o          \"\"^ OD -r 1     lOOC CO    1- in d   00 CE O     oosos    >  o   c^'oi o   coco m    CC r5 CO   u-j O) -^     C CT CO   Co' (7)   Â«G>1TO         â€¢\"1    55            â€ž            -InOlw    O 'S* *?>   en      C0C5(N    X   coci d in    t^ *r -^      y.   00 ^ m     rH r-l in   X3   -^ cc o       IT â€” c:     â€” CO   o    o C105 â€”    OS lO f   CO OS CO     32; \"=   ^- â€¢    O 3: o:   1^ T CO    i~ -crco   lOQ) Tr     OS CO CO   CN= 1   O   n CI CM           1   i;            I   Iq   -^O CO   CO     r--   -; oom    12   enâ€” 1 o o   fSJ â€¢â€” â€” '   en     CD   in o â€” '    l^    S   Si^-sn   o Tj-oo r-    CD (NtC   00 CO C3S   mm â– T    c^l^â– co   tn =    c oioi   X oco    CXI uo C*5   m CO T     (Â»ClCO   r-^O   CO   n CiOi                    _            Olo-fe.

ON THE BEST HOURS OF DAILY OBSERVATION TO FII^D  THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE YEAR.  BY PROF. CHESTER DEWEY.  The mean temperature of a day is to be obtained, originally, from  observations of the thermometer, taken twenty-four times daily, or  double that number. The mean of daily and hourly observations of  this kind must give a close approximation to the actual mean tem-  perature. From a series of such hourly observations the two, or three^  or four hours may be selected, which will give nearly an equivalent  result.  The large Meteorological Society of Manheim, in Germany, selected  the hours of 7 a. m. and 2 and 9 p. m., but I could find no reason for  this selection in any accessible work, when I began observations in  meteorology in 1815, In 1816 and 1817 I made twenty-four hourly  observations of five days each in the different seasons ; the first of the  kind on record, so far as I know, being made for thirty days. The  mean of the 24 observations is 41Â°. 50 ; of 10 a. m. and 10 p. m, 41Â°. 45;  and of 7, 2 and 9 about one desfree higher. Coming so near the mean  I adopted those hours of the Manheim Society, for the ease of com-  parison with the results obtained by them.  The mean of observations at 6 a. m., 2 and 10 p. m., gave a close  approximation to the mean of 24 observations ; but tlie morning hour  would be too early for half the year in view of many observers.  The results of this series of observed temperature I communicated  to Secretary Calhoun, as he was about to organize the system of  meteorological observations, so successfully made by the surgeons at  the military posts of the United States since 1819. These hours were  adopted for all the posts.  The fitness of these hours, 7 a. m., 2 p. ra., and 9 p. m, for obser-  vations, is sustained by the following facts :  1. By the hourly observations for a year at Leith Fort, Scotland.  These give the mean of 24 daily observations, 41Â°. 50 ; of 10 a. m. and  10 p. m. very nearly the same ; and of 7, 2 and 9 about one-fourth of  a degree above the mean of the 24 observations.  2. By the hourly observations at Amherst College, Massachusetts,  through 1839, under the direction of Prof. Snell. The mean of the  24 observations is 47Â°. 23 ; of 10 a. m. and 10 p. m., is 47Â°. 16; and of  7, 2 and 9, is 47Â°. 88. This last, then, is two-thirds of a degree above  the 24 mean. Prof. Snell shows the mean at 6 a. m.; 2 and 10 p. m.  is nearly the same as the mean of the 24 observations.  3. By the \" Girard Observations,\" under the direction of Prof. '  Bache, an extensive series of several years, bi-hourly and hourly.  The mean of 7, 2 and 9 is only three-tenths of a degree above that  of 24 observations, and from this last, that of 10 and 10, differs only  one-tenth of a degree. ;  4. Brooklyn Heights' Observations, hourly, for 1856, by E. Meriam^  esq. I have summed only the first seven days in each month. The  mean of 24 observations is 47Â°. 72, and of 10 and 10 is very near the   METEOROLOGY. 3 1 1  same ; while tliat of 7, 2 and 9 is 48Â°. 28, or greater than the 24 mean  by one-half a, degree nearly.  5. At Sacramento, Cal., lat. 38 N. The 24 mean is 64Â°. 41, and  the mean of 7, 2 and 9 is 64Â°. 11.  Note â€” By the last three it is evident that the mean of 7, 2 and 9  approaches nearer to that of the 24 mean, as the places have a lower  latitude, and an examination of the 24 hours ohservation in the Arctic  regions show^quite a departure of the mean of 7, 2 and 9 from the  mean of 24 observations.  The 24 hourly observations give the mean of the year â€”  At Halle 48Â°. 00  AtGottingea 52 82  At Padua 56 74  On calculating the mean of 7, 2 and 9, I find that â€”  At Halle '. 48 89  AtGottingen 53 45  At Padua 57 47  Observations on the temperature of Salem, Massachusetts, were  made with much care by Dr. Holyoke for thirty-fchree years precediilg  1819. The hours of observation were four, viz : 8 a. m., noon, sunset,  and 10 p. m. By interpolating for sunset, in my series of 24 daily  observations, I found that the mf-an from these four hours is only a  little greater than that of the three hours, 7 a. m., 2 and 9 p. m.  Dr. Hulyoke's mean temperature of Salem is 48.68 degrees. The  mean heat at Leith, by the 24 daily observations, is 48.24, and by the  hours, 7, 2 and 9, is 48.50.  This approximation from these four hours, and one of them variable,  is another unexpected result.  Between 1842 and 1855 the observations at the military posts were  directed to be made at four periods of the day, viz : a little be/ore sun-  rise as the coldest generally ; at 3 p. m. as the hottest, and at 9 a. m.  and 9 p. m. as approximating the mean temperature of the day, but  half the sum of the observations at sunrise, S. R., and 3 p. m. was  to be taken as the mean heat of the day. In the preparation of the  \"Army Meteorological Register,\" published in 1856, the fourth part  of the sura of those four observations was taken as the mean of the  day, because Dr. Coolidge and his associate became satisfied from  extensive comparison of the twenty-four daily observations, that the  mean of ttie four observations was nearer the twenty-four mean, than  those at sunrise and 3 p. m. would give. Dr. Coolidge states also,  that the evidence was clear from the comparison of numerous twenty-  four hourly observations at the posts that the mean of 7, 2, and 9,  was for all the posts, the nearest approximation of any hours selected  to the mean of the twenty-four daily observations. In 1855, there-  fore, the Surgeon G-eneral, Dr. Lawson, issued his circular requiring  a return to the original hours of observation, viz: 7 a m., 2 p. m.,  and 9 p. m.  In ascertaining the relative correctness of the results in the \" Con-  solidated Tables\" of the Army Meteorological Register, taken for   312 METEOROLOGY. J  twenty-three years from the three daily observations, and for twelve  years from the four hours' record, it was important to make some tests.  These are as follows :  1. Prof. Snell performed the labor of interpolating for sunrise in  liis hourly observations for the year 1839, and sent to me the following  resuH: While the mean of the twenty-four hourly observations is ;]  47Â°. 23, the mean of the four hours, S. R., 9 a. m., 3 and 9 p. m., ig â€¢  47Â°. 13, making a difference of only one-tenth of a degree.  This was an unexpected result, iDut of high interest. My own ob- - ^  servations interpolated in the same way gave only a little greater rl  difference.  2. The Consolidated Tables in the Army Meteorological Eegister  yield the following proofs:  a.â€” For Fort Columbus, N.

The conclusion from the above results is that the observations at the  three hours, and at the four, give close approximations.  To all this add the assertion of Dr. Coolidge, j)reviously mentioned,  which led to a return to the hours of 7 a. m,, 2 and 9 p. m., at the  Military Posts. At these three hours also, the observations under  the direction of the Smithsonian Institution are made over the country.  These are convenient hours for recording observations over our ex-  tensive country, and the results need only slight correction, according  to the publications in the Toronto Observations, and still less accord-  ing to the data already detailed.  From the observations of 1839 at Amherst College, and the results  communicated by Prof. Snell, I have deduced the following table of  corrections. Their object is to give the monthly mean, and hence  the annual mean of twenty-four daily observations, by applying the  numbers in the table, to the monthly mean at any hour, according to  their sijjns:   314   METEOROLOGY.

For the two hours, 7 and 7, in April, you would have â€”  ^2-57 + 50.23 5.97-1.69:= 48.54 ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^  2^2 '  For the three hours, 7, 2, and 9, in March, take out the three means â€”  30.19 H- ^ 3.15 + 32.92 _ 35 42^ and corrections from the tables are   4.G2 â€” 8.34 + 1.89   3   = â€” 0.61.   The sum 34.81 is the mean of the 24 observations  for the mouth of March.  Note. â€” At the foot of the preceding table are given the corrections  for observations, made at various different hours of the days, to show  the nearer or more remote approximations to the mean of the 24 daily  results.  The first of these is for the hours 3 and 9 a. m., and 3 and 9 p. m.,  the hours adopted by the Royal Society for obtaining the approximate  mean temperature. These hoiirs are convenient, except that of 3 a. m.  The next corrections are derived from one-fourth of the observations  at 7 a. m., 2 p. m., and 2 (9) p. m., the last being twice the temper-  ature of 9 p. m. Avery near approximation is easily obtained in  this way : Thus, the mean of the year, in Amherst observations â€”  At - - - 7 a. m., is 42Â°. 46   At -  Twice   - - 2 p.m.,  - - 9 p. m.,  by 4 - - -  le correction -   is  is   55Â°  91Â°   .29  .40  .15  .29  .11   from    Sum -  Divide  Addtl   189Â°  47Â°   the table.   Approx. mean - - = 47Â°. 18  Mean of the 24, hourly = 47Â°. 23  Difference - - - - = 0Â°.05, only ^i^th of a degree.  Using the same formula for the Leith observations, the approximate  mean differs from that of the 24 observations only g^J o^h degree.  And for Toronto 4^0 \"  Franklin arsenal, Pennsylvania 3V0 ''  Halle, about ^ ''  Padua, less than ^ \"  Gottingen y^o \"  Girard observations, not -j-^o- *'  Brooklyn heights about the same.  The advantages of using the fourth part of the observation at 7 a.  m., at 2 p. m., and twice that at 9 p. m., are obvious. The preceding  cases are ample illustration.  This table of corrections will have a special value in our country  from the locality in the heart of New England, where the observa-   316 METEOROLOGY.   M   tions were made. No similar table has before been derived from tlietn.  While it presents the analogies of other similar tables, it will be  better adapted to a large district of our country where meteorological  observations are being made systematically. Some gratification will  result to Professor Snell in such an application of his laborious and  scientific efforts, in this particular, in 1839.  Such tables, it is evident, avail nothing where one or more times of -  observation, as sunrise or sunset, have a constant change, even though;  they may give an approximate mean. In different latitudes sunrise>  has different hours, as well as sunset, and the corrections must requirer  a far greater series of observations and far more labor. Though thei  four hours used at the military posts for several years give an approxi- 'â–   mate mean, no correction for the sunrise observation is yet obtained.!  So great is the labor of making the observations, and of discussing  them for practical purposes, that the fewest practicable hours, noti  exceeding three, should be adopted for the observations of meteor- 1  ologists generally. Only a few observers, who are favorably situated 'i  also, can afford to make hourly observations for a year or for years;;  and when such have been made, as enable observers to make the cor--  rections from prepared tables^ the great object will be attained by  using only three hours of observation. The last line of corrections in i  the preceding table is derived from six hours of observation, used for'  some time at the Toronto Observatory, viz: six and eight a. m.j two  and/owr and ten p. m., and ituelve, or midnight. Though the correc-  tions are very small for these six hours, they are too numerous fori  ordinary object or advantage. The same objection lies against the  use of any four hours separated by six hours, as one and seven, both  a. m. and p. m.; which^ however, give very nearly the mean of 24  observations a day. Some of these hours will be very inconvenient  and troublesome. Take even the hours adopted by the Royal Society,  3 and 9 a. m., and 3 and 9 p. m. ; 3 a. m. is a very inconvenient hour,  though the four give very nearly the mean of the daily 24 observa-  tions, as shown in the first line of particular hours.  In a series of observations of twelve years, like those in the \"Army;  Meteorological Register\" of 1856, these four hours, or any four hours,;  would require a million more observations than the three hours, be-  sides increasing the labor of the reductions one-third more than is â–   necessary to attain the same approximation to accuracy.  It is hoped that adequate evidence of the value of observations at  the hours 7, 2 and 9, has been presented, and that a near approxi-  mation to the true mean is attainable. The results may be corrected,  if need be, by the prepared tables.  Rochester University, March 31, 1858.   METEOROLOGY.   317   METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS.  BY J. WIESSNER.  1st. The daily results of mean temperature of the air in shade, as  )bserved on a farm in the District of Columbia.  2d. The monthly results.  3d. A trial adjustment, assuming that the mean motion of tem-  perature may be represented by the motion of an elastic ball jumping  ip and down.  4th. A comparison of the Washington summer with the summers  it Naples, Rome, Constantinople, Petersburg, and Savannah.  The probable error for the Washington series being very small,  shows that the observations were made carefully and in large num-  3er ; also, that the last summer was a very regular one.  The figures in the former table for adjusting the daily observations  tiave the probable error dr 0Â°.3, so that ten years' further observa-  tions will make them correct to the last figure.  Next, a table containing p for each day of observation. By  jsing the three tables and the simple formula ?â€ž = ^m + P ^^5 ^11  the observations now at the end of 1857, 4,500 in number, may be  recomputed and compared with the individual records, which will  ^ive an average probable error of a single observation and reduction,  = zb 1Â°.4.

BY STILLMAN MASTERMAN, ESQ.  Weld, Maine, February 26, 185T.  Dear Sir : Pnrsuaat to my promise, I present to you the registry  of certain miscellaneous natural phenoraena observed l3y myself during  a few past years, belonging principally to the departments of meteor-  ology and astronomy. Fragmentary and unsystematic as the obser-  vations are, they can be of comparatively little value ; however_, as  every phenomenon of nature, even the most trifling, is worthy of a  place in the great study of the universe, and as you are desirous of  collecting all registries of natural phenomena, I deem it proper to  place them at your disposal. The accompanying observations were  made with no idea of placing them before the public, but under the  conviction that perhaps they might be of some use in my future scien-  tific investigations. Moreover, they were conducted during fragments  of time which happened not to be taken up by what I considered to be  more imjtortant duties, therefore in many cases they are separated by  long intervals of time, not from the want of phenoraena to oDservc,  but from an inability to make trustworthy observations. So few ob-  servations afford very insufficient data for generalizations ; however,  the coincidence of certain results with those derived fr,)m more exten-  sive series are frequently very apparent. The following are some of  the well known principles which the annexed observations tend to  confirm :  1. That shooting stars have been more numerous, at,least for a few  past years, on or about the 10th of August, and for a number of days  both befor > and after that date, than at other times of the year.  2. Tliat these meteors frequently leave long bright trains behind  them in the sky.  3. That during an exhibition they commonly have one general  direction of motion.  4. That exhibitions of the aurora borealis commonly commence at  an early hour of the evening.  5. That auroral exhibitions generally have their maximum before  midnight.  6. That in our latitudes auroras have been seen in all parts of the  sky.  7. That the zodiacal light may be seen, in the absence of the moon,  on clear evenings during the months of January, February, and  i March.  8. That this cone of light lies nearly in the plane of the ecliptic.  9. That the zodiacal light at times may be traced above 90Â° from  the sun.  Yours, truly,  STILLMAN MASTERMAN.

I saw a very brilliant  shooting star, which i'ell in the northwest. I should judge that when â–   it was in sight I could have read the smallest print without difficulty  in its light. It left a bright streak or tail of phosphorescent matter, i  60*^ or 70Â° in length, which remained motionless for about 30 seconds, â€¢â–   when it gradually vanished. The nucleus of light was apparently of i  three-fourths the diameter of the lunar orb, and it was about 2 seconds 1  in passing over 70Â° of the celestial sphere, disappearing very near the  horizon.  1849 â€” Septemher 15. â€” Saw three large shooting stars.  jSeptemher 19. â€” Observed three shooting stars.  September 20. â€” At 8A. p. m. I observed a brilliant shooting star, i  enveloped in a nebulous mist, and having a cylindrical cometic tail, 1  4Â° in length. It shot out brilliant jets or tufts of rays from its nucleus \\  on its foremost side, which were bent back into the tail, presenting, :  in miniature, the phenomena of Halley's comet, so conspicuous to  astronomers, during its last return in 1835. It passed between a An-  dromecloi and /3 Fegasi, towards Fomalhaut, describing 60Â° of the  heavens in about 2 seconds' time. I also observed two other shooting  stars on the same evening.  October 3, evening. â€” Saw two shooting stars.  JSIovemher 14. â€” In the evening I saw four shooting stars.  1850 â€” August 4. â€” At 8A. 30m. p. ra. I observed a large meteoric  star. Its path was marked by a trail of light nearly 15' in Avidth,  which disappeared in about 4 seconds' time. Its path lay from a  Cygni to near Â£ Sagittarii.  August 5. â€” At 2h. p. m. saw two shooting stars. The first appeared  to be as bright and to subtend nearly the same angle as the planet  Jupiter. It passed from Unuk al Ray in the Serpent to Arcturus in  about three-lourths of a second. The other appeared like a mere line  of light described by a brilliant point, and vanished in an instant.  August 7. â€” At 9A. 30w. p. m. saw a meteoric star, apparently to  pass from near o Draconis by j3 of that constellation to the foot of  Btrcides. It appeared to be a streak or trail of light about 8Â° in  length, and, if my measurement of time can be trusted, it described  an arc of 30Â° in less than a half second.  August 9. â€” In the evening saw four shooting stars.  August 10. â€” Between 87i. 30m. and 9/i. 20m. p. m. I saw thirty-four  shooting s+ars, some of which were very brilliant. All excepting four  small ones appeared to pass down the Via Lacte, or near to and  parallel with it, from the northeast to the southwest, some as follows :  h/i. 30m., one passed from near e Cygni, between a and ^Q Aquilce, to  the 31illc Dipper in Sagittarius ; Sh. 35. m, two passed from Dculeus  to the head of Capricornus ; Sh. 40m., one passed from yj OphiucJii to   ! ' METEOROLOGY. 325  Scorpio; S7i. 48m., one passed from Scutum Sohieski to j Saglttarii ;  ISA. 5Sm., observed two at the same instant, having their paths nearly  {parallel with each other, and about 8Â° apart. One passed to the cast  and the other to the west of the Milk Dipper. All of the foregoing  seven meteors were accompanied by trails of liglit.  August 11 â€” Between l/i. and 'Ih. a. m., saw twenty-one shoot-  ing stars during ten minutes' observation. They passed down the  \\3lilky Way Irom Oygnus to Scutum Sohieski. A greater part of them  Weie attended by trails of light,  I September 1. â€” At about 9A. 10m. p. m., there was a brilliant meteor  in the west, which approached the horizon rather slov/ly, describing  in appearance a serpentine line. Its light was almost equal to that  of the full moon, and its apparent diameter nearly 20'.  September 4. â€” Between \\h. and 4/i. a. m., observed eight shooting  stars. Some of tliem left brilliant trails.  September 22. â€” In the evening, saw two shooting stars fall in tlie SB.  September 30. â€” Between 8^. 5m. and 87i. 10m. p. m., saw two shoot-  ing stars fall to the southwest. Between 9/i. 45m. and lOh. of the same  evening, I saw three shooting stars pass near to the Milky Way and  barallel with it.  October 7. â€” In the evening, saw three shooting stars.   October 9. â€” In the evening, saw four shooting stars.  October 30. â€” In the morning, saw a brilliant shooting star. Even-  ing of same clay, saw two shooting stars. One appeared to rise up-  wards from the earth. It was in the vicinity of the constellation  Perseus.  November 1. â€” About 47?-. a. m.^ observed two meteoric stars.  November 10. â€” 8/i. 30m. p. m., saw a meteoric star.  November 12. â€” 6|/t. p. m., saw a brilliant shooting star pass from  bear d Copricornus to /9 Draconis. It left a conical trail of light,  Which remained visible but a little more than one second. Betweea  \\lh. and 8A., saw a shooting star.  November 13 â€” At G7i. 30m. p. m,, saw a meteoric star.  November 20. â€” In the evening, I saw a swiftly moving shooting  star. I judged that it moved 20Â° of the sphere in ^ second.  November 24. â€” 77i. p. m., I saw a meteoric star.  December 1. â€” In the evening, saw two shooting stars.  December 30. â€” 67i. 38^re. p. m., saw a brilliant m.eteoric star.  1851 â€” January 11. â€” Evening, saw a small shooting star.  January 24. â€” Evening, observed two shooting stars.  March 31. â€” I saw two shooting stars.  STILLWATER, MINNESOTA TERRITORY.  1851 â€” July 19. â€” In evening, saw four shooting stars.  Atigtist 5. â€” In the evening, observed two shooting stars.  August 9. â€” In the evening, saw three shooting stars during fifteen  minutes' observation.  August 10. â€” In the evening, saw nine shooting stars during one  Jiour's observation.   326 METEOROLOGY.

AURORA BOREALIS AND OTHER METEORS.  WELD; PRANKLIN COUNTY, MAINE.  Bonarkahle Meteor.  I 1850 â€” September 30, â€” At 9/i. 307n. p. m. I saw a remarkably  jgtrange meteor iu the southern sky. Its shape was that of an ellip-  ':ical zone or ring, and when first seen its centre was about 5Â° east  and the same distance north of FomaUiaut, or in R. A. 23/i. dm.,  jind declination 25Â° 23'. Its longer axis lay in nearly an east and west  direction. The length of its transverse axis was about 10Â°, and of its  ?3onjugate diameter 5Â°. Width of the bright belt or annular surface  pn the upper part of the ellipse 2Â°, on its lower part 1Â°. The north-  ern part was very brilliant, but its southern part was dimmer. It  Inoved slowly to the westward, and also had a rotary motion. At 9/i.  iom. its centre was 4Â° north of Fomalhaut and on the same declina-  â€¢ion circle ; being less brilliant tlian when first observed, but of the  drst noticed figure.  i At 107i. its centre was in about R. A. 22A. 257/1., and declination  127Â° 23'. Its length was then nearly 15Â°, and width 3Â°. It was  icarcely perceptible. It disappeared at lOA. 10Â«i.  STILLWATER, MINNESOTA TERRITORY.  First Class Aurora.  \\ 1851 â€” Sppteniber 29. â€” In the evening there was a remarkable exhi-  bition of the Aurora Borealis. Soon after dark I observed a small and  jrilliantly white orch, having its point of culmination, which was about  10Â° above the horizon, very nearly, if nut precisely, in the magnetic  [meridian, in the north. (The magnetic needle has a variation at this  place of about 9:^-Â° east, epoch 1850.) Soon after this, deep red streamers   328 METEOEOLOGY.   I   were shot upward from the arch, 10 or 15 degrees apart, along its  whole length, which converged to a focus, as it were, in the south mag-  netic pole of the dipping needle. One of these, which stretched like  a broad band along the magnetic meridian, was of a deep crimson or  almost blood color. After a short pause the northern arch began to  rise slowly towards the zenith, where it was apparently dispersed.  On the disappearance of the first arch in the zenith a second arch  began to form, and was soon completed, in the south, just as if it was i  the reuniting of the first arch after passing the zenith ; also concentric!  with tlie magnetic meridian, and having an altitude of 30Â° above the i  southern horizon. The extremities of this southern arch reached i  nearly 40Â° on each side of the magnetic meridian. Beneath this arch, i  which was about 5Â° in breadth, was an intensely black arch concen- i  trie with the white one. Just as the southern arch was formed, twoi  deeply red belts, springing from the horizon at the points formerly ;  occupied by the extremities of the northern arch, stretched themselves '  through the zenith, crossing each other at that point, and ran down i  nearly to the southern arch. These soon vanished, when a black seg- '  ment of a circle was formed in the magnetic north, having its edge :  fringed with a silvery white. During this the southern arch had i  remained nearly unchangeable. Presently, alternately red and white  streamers darted up from the horizon, or near to it, all around the con-  cave, varying in width from 1Â° to 3Â° or 4Â° and converging towards  the zenith, the southern arch still remaining as before. On the ceasing  of this phenomenon the southern arch became serpentine in its course.  About two hours after thiSj that is about 11 o'clock, the aurora,  arriving at its maximum, presented a most beautiful spectacle. The  whole northern sky, from the east to the west, became thickly beset  with a multitude of stud like streamers, in the north coming to within  only about 15Â° of the horizon, but at the east and west meeting the  horizon along an azimuth of nearly 30Â°, which all converged into a  beautiful corona about the pole of the dipping needle. These stream-  ers seemed all to have a sort of tremulous or wave-like motion from  one side to the other in rapid succession. Shortly afterwards the (  corona sent out streamers down the southern sky, thus completing the t  auroral illumination of the whole visible concave. Just at this time -;  there was another arch formed, in the north, that is to say in the mag-  netic north, stretching about 60Â° along the horizon, with an altitude  at the culminating point of 40Â°, and composed of brilliant white  columns diverging from the north point of the compass, shaded with  black beneath. In a few minutes this arch mingled itself with the  columns, converging to the pole of the dipping needle ; then there  followed a succession of auroral Avaves, passing over the whole sky,  not unlike the electric flashes sometimes observed in thunder clouds.  The southern arch maintained its position nearly three hours, disap-  pearing, hov/ever^ during the occurrence of the last named phenome-  non. Daring the above auroral display the sky was clear from clouds ;  for as brilliant as the auroras were the brighter stars could be j^lainly  seen through them, even where they were intensely black. The aurora  continued more or less brilliant during the remainder of the night.  This auroral display was characterized by all the more conspicuous   METEOROLOGY. 329  phenomena of tlie liigher classes, sucli as arches, streamers, a cofona,  and auroral waves, the corona and waves being remarkably developed.  The southern arch, however, was perhaps the most remarkable phe-  nomenon of the exhibition.  Second Class Aurora Borealis.  December 23. â€” In the evening there was an auroral exhibition. A  dark arch was formed in the north, having an altitude at its culmin-  ating point of 15Â°, and its centre of curvature lying in the magnetic  meridian. Numberless streamers shot upward from the .arch to an  elevation of 45Â°. The aurora was visible about one hour. The bril-  liancy of the streamers would place this exhibition in the seco7id class  aurora.  Lunar Halo.  December 27. â€” In the evening I saw a beautiful halo around the  moon. The interior diameter of the ring was about 3Â°, and its exte-  rior diameter was fully 7Â°. The inner edge of the ring was of a deep  crimson color, and its exterior a brilliant blue ; while it had an inter-  mediate annulus of yellow, bordering on an orange color. The width  of the red ring was fÂ°, that of the blue fÂ°, and that of the yellow ^Â°.  The phenomenon was seen only about three or four minutes.  Auroras of the Third and Fourth Glasses.  1852 â€” January 23. â€” In the evening saw a fourth class aurora bore-  alis.  January 24. â€” In the evening I observed the aurora borealis, but the  exhibition was of little importance, being of the lowest class.  February 7. â€” In the evening saw aurora borealis.  February 18. â€” In the evening there occurred quite a brilliant exhi-  bition of the aurora borealis, with finely developed streamers. I saw  a very curious auroral meteor in the constellation Virgo. Its shape  was that of the head of a huge spear. Its foremost point was in the  vicinity of Spica, and the two anterior points were situated, the one  near y, and the other near r^ of that constellation. It remained visi-  ble only a few minutes.  February 19. â€” In the evening observed a slight auroral corrusca-  tion.  Parhelia.  February 26. â€” In the morning I observed two brilliant parhelia, one  on each side of the sun. The sun's altitude at the time was nearly  15Â°, and the mock suns were distant about 30Â° on each side of the real  sun. On their inner, or sides next the sun, their light was of dazzling  brightness, and their outer sides were tinged with the prismatic hues.   330 METEOROLOGY.   Minor auroras.  March 9. â€” In the evening the sky was clear and serene. I saw an  auroral arch in the north, having its centre coinciding with the mag-  netic meridian.  March 12. â€” In the evening, saw the aurora borealis.  March 17. â€” In the evening, saw a fourth class aurora borealis.  Parhelia.  3Iarch 1*7. â€” Soon after sunrise I observed two parhelia, one on each  side of the sun, which remained visible at least two hours.  3Iarch 19. â€” After sunrise I saw a parhelion.  WELD^ FRANKLIN COUNTY, MAINE.  Aurora horealis.  November 10. â€” In the evening I saw an auroral display, con-  sisting of a number of short streamers beset around the magnetic  norlh. While gazing on theee I beheld a meteor resembling an  electric spark, which suddenly emerged from a brilliant streamer that  lay in the magnetic meridian, and vanished in a moment. It a])peared  to have a lateral and downward movement of about 2Â°. Color of  streamers yellowish white.  November 11. â€” In the evening I observed an auroral exhibition,  which was much more brilliant than that of the 10th instant. The  streamers reached a height of 45Â°, being intensely bright, and of a  yellowish white color.  Solar halo. ^  r-  1853 â€” 3Iay 2*7. â€” When the sun had descended about a semi-diam-  eter of its lower limb, below the horizon in the west, I saw the fol-  lowing semi-circle of a solar halo. The interior diameter of the circular  halo was about 8Â°, and its exterior diameter 18Â°. Its interior was  crimson colored, and the several prismatic hues were depicted out-  ward in succession. It was very brilliant, and a beautiful object for  contemplation.  Aurora horealis.  June 2. â€” In the evening, saw an auroral exhibition. The streamers  were quite brilliant, long, and slender.  June 27. â€” At a little past SA. in the evening I saw a fine aurora.  It was in the form of a great arch, about 140Â° in length, and from 2Â°  to 3Â° in breadth. The arch on the east approached within 3Â° o^ Alt air ;  on or near the meridian it passed through Coro7ia Borealis ; and its  western extremity was near (^ Leo7iis. It was very brilliant ; and I   METEOROLOGY. 331  observed a 0111111)61 of oscillations or waves pass along its meridian  portion longitudinally. These waves were slow in progress, and some-  what gyratory in appearance. Only a faint illumination was observed  in the north.  Rainbow .  July 12. â€” \"When the sun had been hidden nearly fifteen minutes by  the western hills, and was just on the point of passing below the plane  of the horizon, I saw a beautiful rainbow. The bow was entire, and  of splendid prismatic hues. Fragments of a secondary bow were seen.  The bow in a few minutes showed a great preponderance of red rays,  and did not disappear until the moment of sunset.  # Aurora horealis.  Sepfeniher 2. â€” In the evening, observed an auroral exhibition. At  first, a dark segment of a circle appeared in the magnetic north,  about 10^ in altitude at its culminating point. This was soon beset  around its exterior with brilliant rays of a yellowish white. These  rays extending out laterally shortly formed a serpentine arch, still  with the black beneath. Then a few streamers shot upwards towards  the zenith. Shortly afterwards these phenomena died away, and the  northern sky remained quite luminous, with here and there patches  of cirrus in iilmentous wisps. I saw several small stars through the  dark auroral vapor first observed.  1854 â€” March 26. â€” In the evening observed brilliant aurora hore-  alis. Saw a fine auroral arch, having an altitude from the northern  horizon of above 45Â°, and reaching from the eastern to the western  horizon. Width of arch about 10Â°. I saw many minor exhibitions  of the aurora horealis during the winter of 1853-'54.  Ma7'ch 21). â€” In the evening I observed a beautiful auroral meteor.  It resembled the tail of a huge comet, proceeding from a nucleus about  10Â° north of Sinca Virginis. It lay along below Leo Major, branching  out into two bright streams, with a fainter dawn between, the northern  branch reaching a Canis Minoris, and the southern terminating a few  degrees north of Canis Major. The above was its appearance at 8A.  \\hm. It was very brilliant, and remained visible for sometime.  May 16. â€” In the evening saw a fine auroral arch, having an alti-  tude of 70Â° in the north. It was composed of a great number of short  transverse streamers 2Â° or 3Â° apart.  Rapid oscillations in refraction.  September 4. â€” In the evening I observed rapid vertical oscil-  lations in the lunar orb, when crossed horizontally by thin cirrus  bands ; the latter projected in perspective on the lunar disk, reminding  one of the belts of Ju[)iter. She appeared to rise and i'all rapidly in  the vertical through about |^Â° arc : corresponding fluctuations being  observed in the shadows of objects in her light. A number of other  persons observed the phenomenon, which lasted about ten minutes.   332 METEOROLOGY.  The altitude of tlie moon was about 15Â° ; and tlie cirrus bands crossing  ber disk remained apparently unchangeable and motionless. A storm  of rain followed before the next morning;.   0.  THE ZODIACAL LIGHT.  WELD, FRANKLIN COUNTY, MAINE.  1853 â€” January 31. â€” On this, as well as several preceding evenings, ,  I have observed a pyramidal column of whitish light, after the ceasing j;  of twilight, extending along the ecliptic from the western horizon to ,  an altitude of 40Â° or more, which must be the conical body of the ;  zodiacal light.  1854 â€” February 21. â€” Between 87i. and 9/i. in the evening I observed  the zodiacal light. Its base at the horizon was above 18Â° in Vv^idth, ,  and the altitude of its vertex about 35Â°.  1855 â€” January 14. â€” After the ceasing of twilight I saw the cone  of zodiacal light. It was very brilliant, as much so as that part of  the milky loay visible at that season. Its vertex was above 90Â° from .  the sun ; in fact, a faint illumination seemed to extend almost to the  eastern horizon. Its width at its base was more than 20Â°. It was  observed on several other evenings of the winter.  1856 â€” February 2. â€” In the evening observed the zodiacal light;  it having been seen on several evenings during the preceding month.  It uniformly reaches about 90Â° from the sun, having an apparent '  width at the horizon of 40Â°. Sometimes a faint reflection is observed 'â–   in the east.  1856 â€” February^ â€” After the ceasing of twilight in the evening ;  observed the zodiacal light. Apparent width at the horizon 40Â°,  length 10Â° from the sun.  1850 â€” Blarch. â€” I saw the pyramidal column of zodiacal light on  every evening, in absence of the moon, during this month. It appears  at the horizon of a width varying from 10Â° to 40Â°, and an apparent  length of from 30Â° to 90Â°, and even upwards.  1857 â€” January. â€” During this month I have frequently observed  the zodiacal light. Its vertex is generally not less than 90Â° from the  sun. On some very clear evenings a faint illumination may be traced li  to the distance of 170Â° or 180Â° from, the sun^ being visible a greater '  part of the night. Its width at the horizon sometimes reaches 40Â°.  Its axis appears to lie a little above the ecliptic, or to have a small  north latitude ; the amount of which is difficult of determination.

SECTION THIRD.  THE LEYDEN JAR AND EFFECTS OP THE DISCHARGE.  [Continued from page 456, of the Report of 1856.]  . THE SECONDARY CURRENT.  Â§ 56. Nature of the secondary current. â€” When a battery is dis-  jcharged by a long metallic wire the current in the conducting circuit  â–  wire induces a current in an adjoining closed wire conductor.  The wire which forms the conducting circuit of the battery is known  as the main ivire.  The wire in which a cifrrent is induced by the action of the current  in the main wire is termed the secondary loire.  [The existence of the secondary current was demonstrated in a series  of experiments by Professor Joseph Henry in 1838, published in the  jTransactioQs of the American Philosophical i?ociety,\" vol. 6, p. 40,  in 1839, a publication apparently unknown to our author.   334   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   The experiments of Riess and of Henry were therefore nearly simul-  taneous, as were the subsequent announcements. The article men-  tioned anticipates, however, much that is discussed in the following  sections of this report, founded on later publications of Kiess and  others. Thus experiments upon screening effects, upon secondary  conductors at different distances, and upon the difference in magne-  tism, were recited. The latter of these, in connexion with the matter  in Â§ 70, throw additional light upon the apparently abnormal devel-  opment of magnetism. But the whole set of experiments, and the  deductions from them, were given as a sequel to similar investigations  upon secondary currents with galvanic electricity ; severed from this  connexion much of their value would be lost, and to reproduce the  whole, together with later researches in the same line, would take up  more space than can be spared in the present volume G. C. S.]  Eiess proved the existence of the secondary current in the following  manner; (Fog. Ann., XL VII, 55.)  Fig. 59.  Let A A, in fig. 59, be a  ^ .Jv-v^<^.eNpv^--Y^P^^ ^ copper wire wound spirally  â€¢â€¢'-â– '''^^^'''^^I^EflW^^^^^^ about a glass tube and in-  troduced into the conduct-  ing circuit of a battery; A.  A consequently is the main  wire. A wider glass tube  is passed over the main  wire, and upon it the sec-  ondary wire B B is wound,  leaving its ends hanging  free. The ends of a third  spiral C D, also wound  upon a glass tube, are to be fastened at a and b.  The connection at h being severed, and the ends of the wire sepa-  rated a little, a spark is seen to pass at h when the battery, with a  sufficiently strong charge, is discharged through the main wire.  This spark is a proof of the existence of the secondary current. A  passage of electricity from the main to the secondary wire cannot take>  place if the secondary spiral be kept at a sufficient distance from the  ends of the glass tube on which it is wound.  A steel sewing needle placed in the glass tube of the spiral D,  which we will call the magnetizing spiral, will be magnetized by the  secondary current.  An electrical air thermometer inserted in the secondary circuit  indicates heat produced by the secondary current.  Figure 59 represents the form in which Kiess first arranged his  experiments. Afterwards (Pogg. Ann., L^ 9) he gave the spiral a  more convenient form.  In a disk of wood, consisting of three pieces glued together, the  diameter of which depends upon the size of the spiral to be formed,  concentric grooves are to be cut and made into a spiral, by joining  each circle with the following one by a curved groove ; the innermost   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   loo   Fig. 60.    ' circle is joined to the second by the groove c d, (figure fiO,) the second  ' to the third by e /, &c. In these  ! grooves a copper wire about half a line  '. thick is so laid as to make a spiral.  ' One end of the wire passes throug.h  I the disk at a, and along the under  ' side to z. From a the wire coils out to  I c, from c to d, from d to e, /, &c. ; x  \\ y is the other end of the wire thus  I wound in a flat spiral.  [ The disk is covered with a thin coat  of pitch before placing the wire upon  it.  The wire being fastened by the su-  perposition of a hot metallic plate, the  , spaces between the rin.t!;s of wire will  I be filled up with the pitch; a heavy heated plate laid on the disk will  I make the spiral perfectly level. This spiral is now blacked with coal  I and pressed upon another wooden disk to  get the marks for a second spiral, which ^s'^''-  [ must correspond with the first as nearly as  possible  I The disks are now fastened to glass sup-  ports, their planes being vertical. They  I are arranged upon the same stand opposite  leach other, and so that they can be ap-  proached and separated at pleasure. This  arrano;ement is represented in figure 61.  \\ Another arrangement of the flat spiral,  [much more convenient for many purposes,  shown to me by Professor Eisenlohr, of Carlsruhe, is represented in  figure 62. One of the spirals is fastened on an upright glass sup-  Iport in a horizontal position. The second ^.^ ^,,  1 spiral is fastened in the same manner on a  [glass rod, which has no foot ; it is placed  lover the other, like the upper, over the  (lower condenser plate.  i The distance between the spirals can be  I changed by placing glass plates of difler-  |ent thicknesses between them. For greater  i distances pieces of varnished wood having  (any desired thickness are interposed.  , The ends of the wires are provided with  i screw clamps z and y, by means of which  'the spiral can be connected as may be de-  sired.  Placing y and z of the lower spiral from one to two lines apart, and  j separating the two spirals by a glass plate, a spark will be seen to  , pass between y and z on discharging ajar, sufficiently charged, through  ' the upper spiral. The spark is produced by the secondary current.    836 EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  Â§ 57. Magnetizing hy the main current. â€” To avoid false conclusions  in regard to magnetizing by the secondary current, magnetizing by  the main current should first be properly investigated.  Such an investigation was first made by Savary. Riess repeated  Savary's experiments and obtained similar results. The following  are Riess' results. â€” (Pog. Ann. XLVII, 55.)  In the conducting circuit of the battery, consisting of 25 jars with  l.j square foot coating each, a spiral of platinum wire was placed ; 26 '  inches of this spiral were wound in 42 coils on a glass tube 3 inches  long. The ends of the wire not wound up were, together, 34 inches:  long.  In each experiment a new non-magnetic English sewing needle,L  13-9 lines long and 0.19 lines thick in the middle, was laid in the  spiral. After the discharge stroke had passed through the spiral thei  needle was magnetized. To test the strength of the magnetism iti  was brought to a certain distance from a compass needle two inches,  long, (in what manner this was done cannot be easily understood from  Eiess' description,) and the deflection produced in the latter observed.!  By increasing the charge of the battery, not only the strength but;  the polarity of the magnetism of the needle changed; as the following  table shows:  Quantity, 5 10 15 20 25 27 29 30 32 35  Deflection, 9Â° 14.5 15 10.3 6.5 â€” 2.5â€”7.5 â€” 8.5 2.3 11.5  It is seen that a stronger charge of the battery was not necessarily  followed by a stronger magnetism ; also, that the magnetism thusi  caused was not always such as might have been expected, according tof  Ampere's rule, (namely, that if we suppose the figure of a man to be  introduced into the circuit, the positive current entering at the feet  and passing out at the head, the figure, when it faces the needle, will  have the north pole on its left hand,) for an abnormal magnetizing of  the needle took place in all the deflections marked with the â€” sign.  In this series the strength of the magnetism of the needle at first  increased with the magnitude of the charge, then decreased until the  direction of the magnetism was reversed, and it was only after still  more powerful charges that the normal magnetism appeared again.  These experiments are a proof that the direction of the discharge  current cannot be deduced from the polarity of the needle.  With weaker charges the needle was normally magnetized ; abnormal  magnetism appeared with increased charges in fine needles only ;  coarse needles are always magnetized normally, although constantly!  increased charges produce in them an alternate decrease and increase  of strength of the magnetism.  Â§58. Magnetizing hy the secondary cury-ent. â€” This peculiarity in the  magnetism of steel needles occurs in like manner in the secondary  current. Magnetism produced by a secondary current will change in  strength and direction:  1. By increasing the charge.  2. By increasing the surface of the battery, the charge remaining  the same. The greater the surface, the stronger Riess found the mag-  netism of the needle ; the same quantity of electricity being distributed   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   337   r over a greater surface, it has a less density, and consequently a slower  I discharge, which is favorable to the production of magnetism.  [ 3. The order of the periods of decrease and increase, as well as that  fof the reversal of tlie magnetism, will he changed by an alteration in  'the secondary circuit, such as introducing wires of constantly increasing  length.  If the scciindary circuit remains metallic as before, but interrupted at  one place, so that the current has to pass with a spark, a very remark-  able influence is observed on the magnetic effect; often the magnetism  is in this way increased very greatly, sometimes it is weakened, and  again it is changed in direction. The strongest magnetization by the  secondary current, amounting nearly to saturation of the needle, has  been obtained in this manner.  4. A continued change in the strength, as well as a change in the  direction of the magnetism produced by the secondary spiral, takes  place when, cceteris paribus, the length of the conducting circuit of the  main spiral is continually increased.  The apparatus shown in figure 62 may be very conveniently used  in these experiments. The lower spiral may be taken for the secondary  circuit, and the magnetizing coil may be introduced between x and y  by screwing its ends in the clamps.  Â§ 59. Production of heat by the secondary current. â€” It has already  been mentioned that the secondary current produces thermal phenom-  ena ; Riess lias also investigated thoroughly the laws of the development  of heat by the lateral current. â€” (Pog. Ann., XLVII, 65.)  In the conducting circuit of the secondary spiral, a magnetic spiral  and an electrical air thermometer were introduced. The following  table contains the thermal and magnetic effects which the secondary  current produces when the surface and charge of the battery are  .changed. aS and q have the same signification's before.

As far as the last three observations, indicated -by *, the observed  temperatures harmonize very well with the formula  s  From all the observations (the tables given by Kiess contain a few v  more) the mean result for a was 0.075 ; the temperatures computed  with this co-ef&cient in the' above formula accord perfectly well with  the observed values. Hence the formula holds good for the tempera- 1  tures produced by the secondary current.  In the observations indicated by * the secondary circuit was inter- r  rupted, so that the current had to pass with a spark. This has a  very important influence (above mentioned) upon the magnetization, i  It is shown here, while the heating power is scarcely afiected â€” it being i  a little diminished.  When a Glerman silver wire, 78 lines long and half a line thick, was i  inserted in the main circuit the heating was less ; the co-efficient a,  which was found above equal to 0.075, was now 0.028.  As may be readily conceived, the quantity of electricity in the  secondary current is greater in proj^ortion as the portion of the main  spiral acting upon the lateral spiral is greater, other circumstances  being equal. In order to determine the amount of increase of the  secondary current thus produced, the secondary coil B B, (fig. 59,)  closed by the platinum wire of the thermometer, was slipped over the  straight prolongation of A A, and the temperature noted which was  produced in the secondary wire by the discharge of g = 20 in s = 5.  Then, in successive experiments, a different number of coils of the  main spiral was brought under the secondary spiral, and the same  quantity of electrifity discharged in the same manner. These experi-  ments gave the following results :   Length of straight   No. of coils.   Heating in the lateral   wire.    wire.

Since we know what elevation of temperature (1.85) is produced in  the secondary v/ire by the action of a straight piece of the main wire  134 lines long, we can compute the heat produced by the action of a  straight piece of the main wire 102, 634, &c., lines long, and thus   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 339  |ke are able to determine how much heat is produced by the action of  24, 53, 82, 101 coils of the main wire.

Action of the mainioire on diff'trent secondary ivires. â€” A piece,  \\{a b,) 26 inches long, of the same wire which* formed the main wire  -â– was stretched out straight ; parallel with it a piece (c d) of the lateral  wire was stretched. The whole secondary circuit, in which the elec-  trical thermometer was inserted, consisted of copper and iron wire.  The piece c d of the secondary circuit, lying opposite a b, being a  part of the iron or of the copper wire which forms the lateral circuit,  with equal charges of the battery the temperature of the thermometer  is the same, provided the iron and copper wire have the same diameter  and the space between a b and c d ia the same.  j Therefore, if the resistance to conduction of the whole secondary  â–º [circuit remains unchanged, it is perfectly indifferent for the strength  !of the secondary current whether a better or worse conducting piece  â– of wire is exposed to the action of the main wire.  j It is impossible for me to understand clearly the arrangement of the  (experiments relating to this matter from the description given. â€”  !(Pog. Ann., L, 3.)  Â§ 61. Decrease of the secondary current in proportion to the distance  ^from the main loire. â€” To find how the action on the secondary wire  ^decreases with the distance from the main wire, the piece running  [parallel must have a great length, because otherwise, at tolerably   340 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS,  great distances, the heating of the lateral wire will be too little to he  observed.  Ri( ss stretched two copper wires 10 feet 6 inches long parallel to  each other, (Pog- Ann., L, 7.) One of them was connected by means  of copper wires 6 feet long with the circuit of the battery ; the ends  of the other were connected by similar wires -with the platinum wire  of the thermometer. By changing the distance between the axes of  the parallel wires the thermometer showed that the current generated  hy the straight 2'>cirt of the conducting circuit of the battery in the paral-  lel wire decreoses in the proportion in ivhich the distarice of the axis of  the ivires ivicreases, provided the distance of the wires at the start is  not too small ; for if the wires approach within a certain limit the  heat produced increases in a less proportion than the distances  decrease.  To obtain somewhat elevated temperatures by the secondary cur-  rent, wires of great length must be used, and the management of  these is very troublesome when they have to be stretched straight.  Hence, when only the generation of an intense secondary current is  desired, it is greatly preferable to wind the wires in a flat spiral, as  already described, (144.)  The current which is excited by the main spiral in the secondary, is  weaker the further the spirals are apart ; but it is easily seen that be-  tween the strength of the current and the distance between the spirals  there cannot be a simple proportion, for any one part of the circuit of  the main spiral excites a current, not only in the curved part lying  nearest to it and on the same side, but also in the more remote part of  the curve, on the opposite side; the latter is indeed weaker, but it acts  against the former and diminishes its effect. But the proportion of  the two opposite currents evidently changes when the distance of the  spirals is changed. If the starting point is from very small distances  of the two spirals the strength of the secondary current at first increases  more slowly, but at a greater distance far more rapidly than the in-  crease of the distance of the spirals.  Â§ 62. Action of adjoining closed conductors on the generation of the  secondary cwrewi. â€”Riess extended on the floor of a room three copper  wires, 0.55 line thick and 10 ft. 6 in. long, parallel to each other,  (Pog Ann., L, 12,) these wires being denoted respectively by A, B,  and C. The axial distance between A and B was 4.45 lines, that of  B and C 2.35 lines.  The wire A was inserted in the conducting circuit of a battery ; from  the ends of the wire C copper wires six feet long led to the thermom-  eter, and consequently the secondary wire C included the thermometer  in its circuit. When B was removed the unit of charge gave a tem-  perature indication of 0.135 ; B being restored to its place nearly the  same temperature was indicated ; but when the ends of B were joined  by a copper wire 14 feet long only 0.094 was the temperature indi-  cated. Hence it follows that â€”  The current generated in a secondary wire hy the conducting wire  of a battery remains unchanged lohen a wire with free ends lies betiueen  the tiuo ivires ; but the current is diminished if the intermediate wire is  closed upon itself.   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 341  It is not essential that the wire B should lie between A and C in  !Â»rder to weaken the current in C, which is generated by the discharge  :iiirrent traversing A. B may lie beyond C or beyond A ; the lateral  Current excited in C by the main current of A will be always weaker  Vhen B is closed, or when a secondary current exists in B, than when  'his is not the case. Hence, ihe main wire of a hattery having generated  â– frical currents in iiuo secondary loires near each other, each of the tioo  mdary currents is weaker than it luould have been were the other not  resent.  Two flat spirals, six inches in diameter, each formed of copper wire  ;3 feet long and 0.55 lines thick, were placed 10 lines apart. The  hermometer of the secondary spiral indicated a considerable heat (42  livision of the scale) when the quantity of electricity (20) accumulated  n four jars was discharged through the main spiral. But when,  inder otherwise equal circumstances, the same quantity of electricity  yas discharged, while a copper disk 6 inches 10 lines in diameter and  ' ?>o lines thick was interposed between the spirals^ the thermometer  the secondary spiral showed no sensible heat.  This remarkable effect of the copper plate evidently depends upon  he good conduction which it offers to the current.  The interposed plate should be a poor conductor to allow a sensible  : at to be developed in the secondary spiral. In proportion as the  anacity for conduction in the interposed plate decreases the current  'u the secondary spiral increases.  Interposing plates were used successively as follows : 1. A sheet of  'in foil 0.01 line thick. 2. One of 0.0168 line thick. 3. Both to-  gether. 4. A sheet of imitation silver paper. These sheets were  niped between glass plates and placed one line distant from the main  uiral. When the two spirals were two and a half lines apart the fol-  lowing temperatures were obtained in the secondary spiral for the unit  â€¢f charge :  Without interposed plate 0.56  Interposed plate of imitation silver paper 0.57  \" \" thin tin foil 0.087  \" '' thick \" 0.056  \" \" both sheets tin foil 0.034  Comparing the last three indications with the corresponding thick-  lesses of the interposed sheets of tin foil, we find that the strength of  he current in the secondary loire is inversely proportional to the thick-  Â£88 of the interposed metallic plate.  The same result was obtained by repeating the experiments in the  ame manner but at greater distances.  Â§ 63. Action of interposed insidating plates upon the formation of the  \\econdary current, â€” Faraday has ascribed a specific inductive capacity  ^o the different insulators in relation to statical electricity, so that  hrougli a glass or shellac plate induction should be much stronger  -ban through air.  !i The origin of the secondary current can only be satisfactorily ex-  plained by the generation of electricity by induction ; and, in his view,  ve should expect currents of difierent strengths, if plates of different   342 EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. |  insulating substances were interposed between the main and secondary  spirals.  If solid insulators possess a greater specific inductive capacity than  air a well marked distinction should be made by means of the secondary  current between solid conductors and insulators of electricity. Thus,  while conductors, used as interposed plates, diminish the secondary  current obtained through the medium of the air, insulators, applied  as interposed plates, should increase the current.  In spite of careful investigation Riess was unable to find such an  increase of the secondary current by the interposition of insulating ;  plates, such as glass, shellac, &c. The use of these plates changes in no i  respect the force of the secondary current, which was found just as i  great as though air only had been between the sj)irals. â€” (Pog. Ann.,  L, 18.)  Â§ 64. Action of the conducting wire of a battery upon itself. â€” We have '  seen that no electrical current can be generated by induction in a wire â€¢  with free ends. The conducting wire of an electrical battery is sucli I  a wire, but since its free ends pass into broad metallic surfaces, ^:  allowing the accumulation of opposite electricities, it is necessary to  examine experimentally whether one part of the wire may not have  an inductive action on another part.  Riess sought to solve this question in the following manner:  (Pog. Ann., L, 19.)  The two spirals, one of which had served hitherto as the main, the  other as the secondary spiral, were placed at a short distance apart, '  and joined so as to form a single conducting wire, so that, on being  introduced into the circuit of the battery, the discharge current had to  pass through both.  In one case the outer end of one of the spirals was united with the cen-  tral end of the other in such a way that when the discharge current in  the one spiral passed from the middle to the outside, it had to pass from  the middle to the outside in the other also ; and, consequently, the  discharge traversed the two spirals in the same direction.  The outer end of one spiral was then joined to the outer end of the  other, so that the current which traversed the one from the middle  to the outside went from the outside to the middle in the other ; the  discharge thus traversing the two spirals in opposite directions.  Now, if one part of the conducting circuit can act upon another, '  each spiral in the first case must cause in the other a current in the  same direction as the main current, but in the last mode of connecting  the spirals a current opposed to the main current ; and hence, in the  last case the force of the current, cceteris paribus, should be weaker  than in the first.  The thermometer being introduced into the circuit along with the  combined spirals, it indicated, under like circumstances, perfectly  equal temperature, in whichever manner the spirals were united ; hence  it follows, that in the discharge of a battery no part of the conducting  wire acts inductively upon another part.  Â§ 65. Retardation of the electrical discharge by conductors near the  conducting wire of a battery. â€” Riess introduced into the conducting   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 343  circuit of a battery (Pog. Ann._, XLIX, 393) a copper wire 13 feet long  and 0.55 line thick, which was coiled in a flat spiral on a wooden disk  six inches in diameter, covered with pitch and supported by a glass  flag, as represented by fig. 61. A series of experiments, made with  fthe circuit thus arranged, gave â€”  h = 0.43 -^  s â€¢  ( A copper plate 6 inches 10 lines in diameter and 0.33 line thick  [was placed parallel to the main spiral, at a distance of 2| lines. It  gave â€”  * 2  h = 0.41 ^  s '  Then a secondary spiral exactly like the main spiral was placed  parallel to it, the ends being in perfect metallic contact. This arrange-  ment gave â€”   h = 0.42 -^  s '  Hence, neither the copper disk nor the secondary spiral had a sensi-  ble influence on the temperature of the conducting circuit. Instead  of the perfect metallic closure, a less perfect closure of the secondary  spiral was made ; that is, the ends of the copper wire were connected  jby a platinum wire 138 lines long and 0.023 in. radius. The secondary  ! spiral thus closed being placed 5 lines distant from the main spiral  I the result was â€”  ' h = 0.32-^;  s  t  I when placed at the distance of only 2| lines from the main spiral the  I result was â€”  h = 0.27 A  s  The secondary spiral, closed by a German silver wire 460 lines  i long and one-twelfth line diameter, and placed 2^ lines from the main  spiral, gave â€”  h = 0.17 A  s  The secondary spiral, closed by a glass tube filled with water 9  inches long, gave â€”  ^ = 0.39 A  s  We will now subject these results to a somewhat closer examination.  The current in the conducting circuit, as seen above, generates a   344 RECENT PEOGRESS IN PHYSICS.  current both in the copper plate and in the secondary spiral, hut the  current in the secondary spiral cannot induce a current in the main  spiral, because the latter is not closed by metal, the two coatings of  the jars being separated by glass. The only possible influence of the  current in the secondary spiral upon that ii^the main spiral is some  retardation of the discharge. ,  Now, if the closure of the secondary spiral is more perfect than that t  of the main spiral, the current of the former will pass more rapidly  than that of the latter, and on that account no reaction of the second-  ary spiral can take place upon the main spiral ; hence, with a more 3|  perfect closure of the secondary spiral, the temperature in the conduct- -  ing circuit is found very little less than when no secondary spiral is *  present.  With an imperfect metallic closure of tbe secondary spiral the  secondary current has a longer duration, and then the discharge cur- -  rent in the main wire finds, during its whole course, the secondary â–   wire traversed by a current passing in the same direction, and we ;  must assume that this is the cause of the retardation of the main cur- â€¢  rent, which is indicated by the diminished temperature ; by imperfect ^  closure of the secondary spiral the temperature in the main current  was reduced in the proportion of 0,43 to 0.17.  By inserting a tube of water into the secondary spiral the tempera-  ture again increases almost as much as though no secondary spiral  had been present, which is well explained by the fact that, with very  imperfect closure of the spiral, no sensible secondary current is gen-  erated.  The circumstance that, with quite perfect as well as with very im-  perfect closure of the secondary spiral, the influence on the main wire  is less than for a moderately good closure, leads us to expect that,  when the secondary spiral is closed by constantly increasing lengths  of thin wire, at first the temperature of the main circuit will decrease,  that, with a given length of the introduced wire, the influence of the  secondary spiral will become a maximum, and then decrease again, and  that, therelbre, the elevation of temperature of the conducting circuit  of the main spiral will again increase when the wire by which the  secondary spiral is closed is lengthened.  This was verified by experiments which Riess made. â€” (Pog. Ann.,  LI, 177.)  Representing by 100 the temperature observed in the thermometre  introduced in the conducting circuit of the main spiral, the secondary  spiral being closed by a short thick copper wire, the results given  by the insertion of a German silver wire 0.1517 line diameter and of  different lengths, are as follows:   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   345   Length of wire.

A metallic closed circuit near the conducting loire of an electrical  \\attery acts retardingly on the discharge of the battery in proportion to  he length of its closing loire. The circuit of the secondary loire being  \\)rogreisively prolonged its action successively increases, attains a maxi-  num, and then decreases.  The changes which the temperature in the main wire undergoes by  engthening the secondary wire, obey the law indicated by the last  'able, whether the charge of the battery be stronger or weaker ; with  iitronger charges, as well as with weaker, the \"retarding effect of the  Secondary wire attains a maximum when the secondary spiral is closed  py 29.6 feet of the above-mentioned German silver wire ; and then the  [.emperature in the main wire is 48 per cent, of that which would  [lave been observed with an equal charge if the secondary spiral had  fi perfect metallic closure ; but as soon as the conducting circuit of  Ihe main wire is lengthened by the introduction of a thin wire the  jourse of the retarding effect of the lateral wire changes.  ' In the main conductor a platinum wire 7 inches 5 lines long and  ).023 line radius was introduced, and the results in the following  :able were obtained ; the lateral spiral being closed by German silver  yire of different lengths :   Length of German   Temperature of   silver wire.   mam wire.   .0 feet   100   29.6 \"   82   49.3 \"   78   69. \"   78   237. \"   91   572. \"   99   846 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  We see here that, on prolonging the main conductor, the maximum  effect of the secondary wire is not reached until a greater length of wire  has been introduced into the secondary spiral^ and moreover that the re-  tarding effect of the secondary wire is now much less. During the pre-  vious experiments the temperature of the main wire was reduced by  the maximum effect of the secondary spiral to 48 per cent.; now, the  maximum effect of the secondary spiral produces only a reduction to  78 per cent, of the temperature, which would have been observed either  without the secondary spiral or by one perfectly closed.  This is easy to explain. The secondary current is stronger in pro-  portion as the part of the main wire acting on the secondary wire is i  greater, and to the stronger secondary current we must also attribute  a greater reaction upon the discharge. The length of the main wire  was the same in both series of experiments, namely, 13 feet of copper '  wire, which acted upon the same length of the secondary wire. In i  the first series these 13 feet made by far the greatest part of the circuit i  of the battery ; in the second a platinum wire was introduced, whose re- '  tarding power was equal to a copper wire 568 feet long and 0.55 line  thick; consequently, in the last case, only about one-forty-fourth part  of the virtual length of the main wire acted upon the secondary spiral. I  Riess caused two other spiral disks to be made, each containing 53^  feet of copper wire two-thirds of a line in diameter. The large and  small spirals were introduced into the main circuit.  The small main spiral being now placed opposite the small secondary  spiral at a distance of 2 lines, the maximum retarding action of the i  secondary spiral took place when it was closed with 29.6 feet of Ger-  man silver wire. With this maximum effect the temperature of the  main circuit was 76 per cent, of that which was observed without the  lateral spiral, or when it was perfectly closed.  When the large secondary spiral was opposed to the large main  spiral at a distance of 2 lines, the maximum retarding action of the  secondary wire occurred when the latter was closed by 79 feet of Ger-  man silver wire, and in this case the temperature in the main wire was  reduced by the retarding action of the secondary spiral to 25 per cent.  Finally, the two secondary spirals, properly connected, being placed  opposite the two main spirals, then 138 feet of German silver wire had  to be introduced into the secondary circuit to obtain the maximum  retarding effect, and the temperature in the main wire was thereby  reduced to 20 per cent, of that which would have been observed with- '  out a lateral spiral. From these experiments it follows that â€”  The maximum effect of a secondary wire upon the electrical discharge  attained by lengthening the secondary circuit is as much greater as the  length of the main ivire acting on the secondary luire is greater. But,  at the same time, to attain this maximum, a proportionately longer circuit  is required for the secondary loire.  The length of the platinum wire in the air thermometer in these  experiments was 143.5 lines. This wire, which is very long in pro-  portion to the whole circuit, can never act inductively on the secondary  wire ; to make the longest possible part of the main wire act on the  secondary spiral, the wire in the thermometer must be shortened, by  which means the action of the main wire is, indeed, increased, but on  the other hand the sensibility of the thermometer is diminished.   EECENT PROGRESS IX PHYSICS.   347   Fis. 63.    Riess, in order to shorten the platinum wire -which closed the main  Spiral, used Berguet's metallic thermometer instead of the air ther-  mometer,  â€¢ A straight platinum wire 61.5 lines long and 0.04 line radius was  fastened immovably in the axis of a sensitive thermometric spiral,  similar to that represented in fig. 63, and intro-  duced into the circuit in a suitable manner. The  [instrument was of course placed under a bell-  glass. The platinum wire in the axis, on being  'heated by a discharge of the battery, commu-  â€¢nicated its heat to the spiral ; the index then  liraversed a number of degrees, but soon returned  :to its first position, in consequence of the rapid  (cooling caused by the large volume of air in the  Jbell-glass.  I The experiments with the metallic thermometer  iteach nothing new, on which account no further mention need be made  lof them, though I could not leave this method of observing unnoticed.  I Â§ 66. Direction of the secondary current.â€” -T^o investigate whether  ;the direction of the lateral current changes with the distance of the  ^secondary wire from the main wire, Riess used the following method.  '(Pog. Ann., LXXI, 351.)  Au insulator, which cannot be pierced by electricity, being placed  between the free ends of the secondary spiral, no secondary current  occurs. Nevertheless the electrical equilibrium of the secondary wire  [is destroyed by the act which would have produced the current, as the  following experiment shows :  I If we place between the free ends of the p.iâ€ž ^4  [secondary spiral a thin cake ot resin, so  ^that the two ends of the wire are opposed  [to each other, after the discharge of the  [battery by the main line, the two surfaces  [of the cake of resin may be distinguished  ;from each other in the most decided man-  'ner. Peculiar electrical figures are pro-  'duced, which, in most cases, are brought  out by slightly breathing upon them. If  jit be desired to fix the figures, it is done,  as shown by Lichtenberg, by strewing the  surfaces with a mixture of flowers of sul-  iphur and minium. On one of the sur-  â–  faces of the resin treated in this way there  'appears a red disk, with a red border, and beyond it a dark (unpow-  ;dered) ring, surrounded by yellow rays. On the other surface yellow  'and red segments of circles are visible, embraced by a wide red ring.  The rays and the ring increase with the  strength of the electrical excitation; with  ' very feeble excitation the rays of the first  figure are wanting, and a simple red disk  r remains, which, however, is sufficiently dis-  \\ tinct from the second figure, in which the  I red ring may always be recognized.    Fig. 65.   FiR. 66.     348   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   Each of these figures is composed of the two elementary forms  wliich Lichtenberg has distinguished as positive and negative, and  for this reason the direction of the secondary current cannot be de-  duced I'rom these figures.  In the ibllowing experiments the ends of the secondary spiral were  lengthened by copper wires, and a part of one formed a short, close  coil, wound to the right. In fig. 67 let x and y indicate the ends of  the secondary spiral to which the above-mentioned wires are attached. 1  To magnetize a steel needle the ends a and /? were  ^'\"â– ^'^* put in contact, and the needle was placed in the coil, 1  with its point toward m. To obtain the figures on j  the resin it was introduced between a and ^. The i  results contained in the following table were obtained i  with the small main and secondary spirals, consisting {  of 13 feet of copper wire, already mentioned.  In the main spiral the discharge current passed in i  the direction indicated by the arrow. The ibllowing Â»  table shows the polarity indicated by the needle when c  it lay in the coil pointing towards m.

Eiess used for producing the figure a small glass or copper plate,  both sides having been covered with a thin coating of pitch or resin.  A surface of resin once used must be heated over the flame of a  spirit lamp to melting before it can be employed again.  The direction of the secondary current, which, as already remarked,  could not be directly determined from the figures of the resin plate,  was ascertained in the following way : Two three-inch condensers  were separated by a thin plate of mica ; the lower one touched the   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 349  ^d of the wire a ; the upper was so near the end /9 that, in dis-  [harging the hattery, a small bluish spark passed. After discharging  jlirough the main spiral the upper plate was removed and tested by  he electrometer. For a positive charge of the battery the condenser  ijlate, which touched the end /3, was found electro-negative. The  Jayed figure (fig. 65) is, therefore, always produced by the end charged  nth negative electricity ; and, consequently, the secondary current has  \\lways the same direction as the main current,  ' The experiment made by Riess for ascertaing the direction of the  ateral current by the decomposition of iodide of potassium i'ailed, as  |e did not succeed in producing the decomposition by the secondary  ^irrent.â€” (Pog.

Ann., XL, 348) of a  jopper wire 105 feet long and one-sixth line in diameter, which,  lovered with three coats of silk and in 260 coils, formed 5 layers on  -eing wound upon a suitable frame. Before winding a length of the  /ire it was twice covered with shellac varnish, and the wrapping  mt on before the varnish was perfectly dry. Each layer was again  larnished after wrapping.  The cylindrical astatic needles belonging to this coil were 22 5 lines  png, 0.4 line in diameter, and 5 lines apart. The combined needles  ade one oscillation in 6.6 seconds.  One of the wire ends of such a multiplier being placed in conducting  nnexion with the conductor, the other with the cushion of the elec-  ical machine, a deflection of 10 to 20 degrees could be maintained  ly turning.  \\ \\ When it is desired to deflect the needle by the discharge current of  â– he electrical battery the discharge of course must be retarded by the  iQsertion of bad conductors, such as moist strings, glass tubes filled  irith water, &c.  , The latest experiments made by Riess on this point (Pog. Ann.,  ILVII, 535) gave results showing that the deflection of a magnetic  ieedie by the wire which slowly discharges an electrical battery is  ndependent of the surface of the battery, provided a perfect discharge  'f the bat-tery takes place. It is therefore immaterial to the dtflec-  ion of the needle whether the same quantity of electricity is distri-  'â€¢uted over one or over several jars.  I Faraday had attempted [Experimented Researches, 363, Pog. Ann.,  1:9) to compare the discharge current of the electrical battery Avith  ,hat of a voltaic current. After obtaining a given deflection of the  inagnetic needle by discharging a battery he constructed a voltaic  ')air, which, acting 3i seconds, produced the same deflection as the dis-  charge of the battery ; and he concluded that the quantity of electricity  'ielded by the pair was equal to that accumulated in the battery.  Riess justly remarks, that this conclusion is not well founded, be-  iiause the instantaneous action of the discharge current of the battery  )n the needle is essentially different from that of a galvanic current.   350   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   B^P^   I have reported Riess' researches without interrupting the course  the narration by speaking of what has been done by others on the sa  subject. Let us now turn to these labors.  Â§ 68. Knochenhauer' s researches on the current. â€” In a second article,  with the title ^^ Experiments on Latent Electricity^\" {Versuche iiber  die gehundene,Elektricitdt, Pog. Ann., LVIII, 391,) Knochenhauer pre-  sents the law according to which the force of the secondary current  decreases when the distance from the main wire increases.  Riess has shown, as already mentioned, Â§ 61, that the force of the  secondary current decreases in the same proportion in which the axial i '  distance of the secondary wire from that of the main wire increases.  Knochenhauer thinks this law is \" evidently insufficient.\"  Starting, apparently, from the idea that the lateral current is a phe- 1  nomenon of induction, Knochenhauer attempts to apply here his law.*  That a law stating the relation between action and distance, adapted  to the case of spherical bodies only, in which all action can be consid-  ered as starting from a single point, cannot hold good for wires run-  ning parallel to each other does not stop Herr Knochenhauer. His  law has such an astonishing elasticity that, by barely changing the co-  efficient, it serves for the secondary current. In his opinion there sub-  sists between the force of the secondary clirrent (measured by the air  thermometer) and the distance of the wire the relation  6 = AaVnr~  in which 6 denotes the temperature of the thermometer in the second- ;  ary wire, and n the distance of the secondary from the main wire.  This n, however, is not the axial distance, but the distance of the  wire in the clear, in which he assumes three lines as unity ; hence  the magnitude of 7i has first to be computed from the axial distance  a given by Riess.  He first compares his formula with the results found by Riess. A  series of these observations he arranged in the following table, with  the values computed by his formula :   d.   6 observed.   e computed.   Difference.   Lines.      2.71   0.216   0.219   + 0.003   6.78   0.145   0.143   â€” 0. 002   11.24   0.119   0.104   â€” 0. 015   16.01   0.081   0.079   â€” 0. 002   19.61   0.066   0.066   0.000   23.87   0.054   Q. 055   + 0.001   In fact the values observed and those computed by the above form-  ula correspond sufficiently well by making A= 0.401, a= 0.489.  Indeed, the formula answers for very short distances, for which the  law of Riess, on evident grounds, is no longer applicable.  But does this accordance of Knochenhauer's formula with the observa-   *See Report of 1856.   EECENT PKOGEESS IN PHYSICS.   351   ions prove its correctness ? Certainly not. When there are two  onstants at our disposal it is easy to invent a whole mass of formulas  i/hich would serve just as well ; that is, they will accord with the few  liumbers observed within narrow limits, quite as closely as the limits  ire narrow. As a proof I propose  <y = A + 6 log. D ;  [he first best arbitrary formula that occurs to me. In this formula let  ) denote the temperature of the secondary wire, D the axial distance  if the wires. Making A = 0.276, and b = 0.16, this formula will  {gree with Riess' observations as well as that of Knochenhauer ; as the  following table shows, in which the third vertical column contains  [he values computed by the above formula :   i  d.   e observed.   e computed.

Knochenhauer has himself made a series of experiments to confirm  is formula, and by which he would show that the magnitude of a  ijiepends upon the conducting capacity of the main circuit,, of the sec-  pndary circuit, &c. The description of the modus operandi of the  experiments, how the wires were extended, &c., is exceedingly obscure,  ,and since, I think, I have proved the inaccuracy of his formula, a  further account of these experiments is unnecessary.  This memoir forms the introduction to liirther researches, which  â– relate to the secondary current and currents in branched circuits.  The following are the titles of the memoir on these subjects:  On the lateral current in divided conducting wires of the battery. â€”  j(Pog. Ann,. LXâ€” LXX, 235.)

Since the design of this report is to present to the reader the prO'  gress of physics, and not to weary him with criticisms on fruitlesr  labors, I need say no more of Knochenhauer's memoir on the latera;  current and kindred subjects. The criticism on the abovementioned  paper suffices to justify me in this respect.  Â§ 69. Charging current of the electrical battery. â€” In Fig. 68 let o  and b denote two electrical batteries, both of which are insulated (  The exterior coatings of both batteries being in metallic connexion,]  suppose a to be charged and b to remain uncharged.

In this manner a is partly discharged and b charged ; the charge  of b is not gradual, as in ordinary charging of jars, but very rapid.  Dove terms the current which, passing from the outer coating of a  to that of b, charges the latter battery, the charging current, (Ladungs-'  Strom,) and he has compared the action of this current with the action  of the discharge current already amply investigated. He found the^  following results, (Pog. Ann,, LXIV, 81 :)  1. Induction. In the outer connecting wire a cylindrical induction  spiral was introduced, surrounded by an exterior secondary spiral.  The effects were the same as in the discharge stroke.  2. Sparks. The outer connecting wire having been interrupted, a  brilliant white spark, with a loud report, appeared at the place of  external interruption the instant tlie spark at the inner conducting  wire passed. A moist thread being introduced into the inner con-  ducting wire, the spark assumes a redish yellow color and has a feeble  report ; the same change is also indicated in the place of interruption  of the outer connecting wire, in which there is no moist thread.  Dove found further that the \"charging current\" produced in the :  same manner as the discharge current. i'i   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 353  3. Galvanic effects.  4. Magnetization of steel.  5. Physiological effects.  6. Penetration of bad conductors, and  7. Evolution of heat.  The needle of a galvanometer inserted in the connecting wire of  he outer coatings is not affected when the inner coatings are brouo^ht  Into metallic contact with a white and loudly sounding spark, without  the interposition of a moist thread ; but it is sensibly affected when a  noist thread is introduced there. The magnetizing of a steel needle  placed in a spiral was produced with great effect in the first case,  iVithout interposition,) but feebly in the second case, (with inter-  oosition.^  I The contents of one of Dove's papers in Poggendorf's Annalen,  'LIV, 305,) bearing the title, \" On the current induced in magnetiz-  ing iron by means of frictional electricity, 'i will have to be presented  later, because this subject is closely related to the corresponding  l^ffects of the galvanic current.  I Â§ 70. HankeVs researches on magnetizing steel needles hy the discharge  \\parkof the electrical battery. â€” Hankel has published two large me-  fnoirs on this subject, (Pog. Ann., LXV, 537, LXIX, 321.) In the  idrst he speaks of Savary's observations, and then proceeds to the  ilescription of his own experiments, the resultsof which are as follows:  1. When the discharge stroke passes through a spiral in which a  iteel needle is placed, a certain minimum of charge is generally ne-  jessary to magnetize the needle. Calling the polarity which it receives  )y the discliarge stroke of this minimum, normal, the needle will be-  lome abnormally magnetic by gradually increasing discharges, and  ^gain normal by still stronger charges, &c. The abnormal magnet-  iism appears with strong charges of the battery, as the pieces of wire  introduced into the circuit of the battery are longer in proportion as  ihe charge is stronger.  i When in addition to the spiral and the pieces of the conducting  iircuit remaining constant in all the experiments, an iron wire 34  jieet long and 0.1 line in diameter was introduced, abnormal magnet-  ism was obtained with a charge 70 (measured by sparks of the measur-  ing jar) ; on inserting 82 feet of the same wire a charge of 120 was  Required, and a wire of 154 feet required a charge of 160.  I 2. When a battery of more, and then one of fewer jars was used  ipith the same conducting circuit, the battery of the less number of  jars produced the abnormal period with a less charge. '  ; An iron wire of 202 feet having been introduced, a charge of 20  ffith two jars produced abnormal magnetization, while by using 5  ars it was only obtained with a charge of 70, and with 9 jars, even  Ihe quantity of electricity 230, did not produce abnormal magnetiza-  ion.  I If with gradually increasing charges, the change from normal to  .bnormal magnetization is not always obtained, these periods are  'levertheless not wholly wanting ; for an increase and decrease of the  Itrength of the normal magnetism is observed, and the minima of the  ' 23 s   354 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS-  normal magnetization correspond in this case to the abnormal  periods.  Hankel applied himself to the explanation of this phenomenon,  and he lays down the following as the fundamental idea :  \" It is known from Faraday's researches, that a current at its com-  mencement generates an opposite current in a neighboring conductor ;  at its cessation, on the other hand, a second current which passes in  the same direction with the original one. The electrical sparks must  act in both ways, upon a steel needle placed near the wires, as the  needle is perpendicular to the direction of the current, the planes of i  the currents produced in the needle are likewise perpendicular to the j  length of the needle, and the magnetism of the needle will be inii  opposite directions according as we consider it to be excited by the i  action of the beginning or by the cessation of the spark. But the twoÂ«  instants of beginning and end of electrical sparks follow each other sos  rapidly, that their separate? effects cannot be measured; -hence magnet-;)  ization is the result of both of these influences.\" j  This is essentially the fundamental idea to which Wrede (SerzeZm' Ji  Jahreshericht, deutsch von Wohler, 20ster Jahrgang, S. 119,) soughtll  to reduce the alternate normal and abnormal magnetism of steel needles '  by the discharge stroke in main as well as in secondary wires.  As already intimated by Kiess, {Dove's Repertorium, VI, 218,) this  mode cf explanation belongs yet to the domain of conjecture. It is  possible that this is the natural process in magnetizing steel needles  loj the discharge stroke, but it is by no means proved.  On the whole this explanation seems very plausible; but the deduc-  tion of the particulars of the phenomenon is not at all convincing,  although Hankel expresses himself quite at length upon the subject.  We will do well to consider this as still an open question.  Riess remarks, in the place above cited in Dove's Repertorium, that  it is better, and more for the furtherance of science, openly to confess  the deficiencies of our knowledge, than to attempt to aid it with half  explanation and to cover up its defects ; and in this connexion he  quotes a passage from Franklin's letters, which should be taken to  heart by every scientific man :  *^I find a frank acknowledgment of one's ignorance is not only the  easiest way to get rid of a difficulty, but the likeliest way to obtaini  information ; I think it an honest policy.\"  In the second memoir Hankel treats of the following points :  1. The number and magnitude of the magnetizing periods, men-  tioned in the first memoir.  2. The action of different spirals.  3. The action of the conducting wire upon itself.  4. The influence of the thickness of the needles.  5. The influence of the surface of the battery.  6. The changes of the alternations by obstacles interposed.  7. Special influence of particular metals^ totally distinct from theii  conducting capacity.  We will consider these points in succession :  1. As a magnetizing spiral, a spiral of silver wire was employee  with coils so close that the introduced needle covered 31 of them,   I   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   ODD   ,he charge of the battery was regularly increased by 1 spark of the  leasuring jar, and at each discharge a new needle was magnetized ;  |ie strength of the magnetism communicated was then determined by  le time which the needle required to make a given number of vibra-  lons. A copper wire 2.63 metres long and 1.2966 millimetre diam-  j;er was used in the circuit together with the spiral.  j In this manner Hankel made a series of experiments whose results  [-e represented graphically in fig. 69. The abscissas are '-ronortional    i the strengths of the battery charges, the ordinates to the strengths  { the corresponding magnetization. The ordinates above the hori-  jintal correspond to normal, those below to abnormal magnetism.  This curve does not produce the impression of regularity ; it seems  ither to mask some sort of a law by irregularities which cannot be  )rrected by computation. But in such cases the law may be repre-  ifnted by averages obtained from numerous experiments.  Hankel says he repeated these experiments with the shortest circuits,  ) determine the position of the abnormal, or equally significant weak  prmal periods ; from all his experiments with the same kind of needle,  ting the same battery of nine jars, he found these periods to occur in  ie following charges: 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 26, 29, 32,  p, 40.  Hankel says, \" we see that the change in the polarity returns regu-  â– rly ;\" but I can find in this series of numbers nothing very clearly  ^pressed, and least of all regularity. He says, moreover, that this regu-  i'rity might have been more clearly represented by the introduction  fractions, but he purposely avoided them, as he had not measured  em exactly, but only estimated them.  I Now, what does this mean ? Does not the above series of numbers  ^present the means of numerous experiments made under the same  iindition ? If this is the case, why hesitate to introduce fractions ?  ^ean values are generally computed, not observed.  , To render it possible for the reader to judge of the value of his re-  filts, Hankel should have told how he arrived at the series 3, 6, 9,  E, &c. ; and he should have communicated the separate series of  periments in order that one might ascertain how far the separate  ries differed from the mean on account of accidental disturbances.   356   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   2. The seiles of experiments represented by fig. 69, were compared  Avitli two others in which the spirahs were so moved in the directio n o  their length that the needle covered only 28 coils in the second, andf  only IH in the third series. The general result was, that the periods I  were longer in proportion as the needles covered fewer coils.  3. As mentioned above, Kiess announced the proposition that, in dis- '  charging a ])attery, no part of the circuit acts inductively upon itself.  Hankel contests this proposition. He comes to the opposite conclu-  sion from the following experiments :  A cop])er spiral of tolerably large diameter was surrounded by a  similar spiral, the two being so arranged that the discharge could at  pleasure be made to pass through the two, either in the same or in  opposite directions.* A magnetizing spiral was also introduced into the i  circuit The march of the magnetizing periods for both arrangements I  being then compared they did not harmonize, and hence Hankel i  inferied that there was necessarily an interference of effects.  Even if it be conceded that Keiss' experiments are not sufficient td :  establish hie proposition, those of Hankel are still less fitted to over- 1  throw it ; for, in the phenomena of magnetism by the discharge stroke, ;  our knowledge of what is regular or what may be accidental is not :    such as to permit a safe conclusion to be drawn from the want of coin-  cidence of two such series of experiments.  The differences which occur in magnetizing steel needles, accordiug  * Hankel gives the lliickness of tlie wire 'o the xTJT^iT^'o ''^ ^ millimetre, which appears to  mc an unnecessary accuracy, considering the other relations of this series of experiments.   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. S57  18 a long wire introduced into the circuit is extended in a straight  line or wound into a spiral, will be considered helow under No 6.  4. It appears in general, as Hankel infers from his experiments,  ;hat with coarse needles the phenomena do not change ; the anomalous  periods occur only with stronger charges, and also appear to have lost  n strength.  5. New experiments on the influence of the surface of the battery,  iorresponding to the previous ones, indicated that a diminution of the  lurface brought about the anomalous periods with decreasing charges,  )ut so shortened them .that, with a certain size of the battery, they  ;eased to appear as abnormal magnetization ; weak and strong normal  )eriod8 only were then observed.  6. Besides the short insertion, with which the results in fig. 69 were  )btained, Hankel made experiments with inserted copperwires extended  n a straight line 0.23 millimetre diameter^ and varying between 0.375  md 96.4 metres in length. The curves 1 and 2, fig. 70, represent  he results which he obtained with the wires 12 and then 96.4 metres  ong. These curves seem to indicate that with longer insertions the  eparate small periods disappear, until at last only a large normal pe-  iod is observed with stronger magnetism, after which follows a very  )road negative period, (from 30 to 100,) in which, however, very weak  nagnetism is observed.  With reference to the disappearance of the smaller periods, these  jxperiments do not admit, in my opinion, of any certain conclusion,  because the charge of the battery was increased from 5 to 5 for the  onger insertions, and from 2 to 2 for the medium, while they increased  [nly by 1 in the shortest. Where is the guarantee that in the longer  *^ires single periods are not passed over ? Hankel preserves silence  n this point.  In relation to the influence of the coils, Hankel compares the result  epresented by the second curve of fig. 70 with those which are given by  03 metres of the same wire wound into 70 coils. While, with straight  /ires, a normal period extends to 30, and is then followed by a long  legative weak one, he observed, with coiled wires, 3 normal and 3 ab-  ormal })eriods.  When 26 metres of a very thick (30.76 square millimetres in sec-  ion) quadrangular copper wire were inserted, no change was seen in  he succession of the periods, but they were generally feebler. When,  b addition, 113 metres of a round (1.3 millimetre) wire were inserted,  jtretclied in a straight line, the results represented in the third curve  |f fig. 70 were obtained. Nearly all reversions disappeared^ the needles  leemed but i'eebly magnetic.  When 94 metres of the thick wire were coiled into a spiral and  pserted in the circuit, the results presented in the fourth curve of  ig. 70 were obtained. The enfeebling of the magnetism appeared  .ere in the thick coiled wires still more strikingly than in that ex-  pended at length.  The influence of the coiling upon the thick and the thin copjier wires is  â€¢vidently very different ; yet, says Hankel, (page 336 of his 2d Memoir,)  he influence is the same in both cases. The discussion, by means of  f/hich he seeks to prove this, is incomprehensible to me ; indeed, I  annot call Hankel's reasoning in general clear and precise.   358 EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  7. The insertion of iron wires yields remarkable phenomena, pro-  ducing anomalous periods of very considerable strength. Hankel  found them particularly striking with thick, long iron wires. While  a thick copper wire greatly weakens the magnetism, the latter is con-  siderably streagthened by a thick iron wire. On introducing an iron  wire 1.27 millimetre diameter and 131 metres longit gave, forinstance,  the result for a charge 6, a normal maximum 11 ; for a charge 36, an  anomalous magnetism of the strength 9|, taking for unity the mag-  netizing strength adopted in constructing the above curves.  Â§ 71. Leyden jars of thick glass. â€” Winter, of Vienna, constructs  Leyden jars which have a much greater striking distance than those'  in general use, and he accomplishes this by using vessels with very  thick sides, (over 1 line,) and by leaving a very wide uncoated border.  Spontaneous discharge is prevented by the width of the uncoatedi  border, and perforation of the glass is prevented by its thickness. In.  such jars the tension of the free electricity on the inner coating cam  reach a far higher degree than in the ordinary thin jars, in which, if  a spontaneous discharge does not occur, a fracture of the glass is to  be feared.  The mutual induction of opposite electricities of the two coatings,;  in consequence of the great thickness of the glass, is less perfect than  with thinner glass. With the same quantity of coating, and with  the same density of the free electricity on the inner coating, less elec-  tricity will be accumulated in thick glass jars than in those of thin  glass ; in general, therefore, the quantity of electricity which a thicb  glass jar can receive is less, but the tension of the free electricity on  the inner coating, and consequently the striking distance, is greater.'  It is to be expected that with the greater striking distance, other  effects of the discharge will also suffer a change. All effects of the  discharge stroke, in which it is chiefly desirable that a great quantity  of electricity should be sent through a body, can be produced better  with large, thin glass jars, but where the force of the shock is the  main object, thick glass jars serve the purpose better; hence it ap-  peared to me probable that the perforation of glass plates should take!  place much more easily with thick jars than with ordinary thin ones.  Trial perfectly sustained my supposition. Formerly, in using large,,  thin jars, a great number of revolutions of the machine were necessary  to charge the battery sufficiently for the perforation of glass, and eveci  then the experiment did not always succeed satisfactorily ; now, 2C  revolutions of a very moderate electrical machine suffice to charge a  thick glass jar so as to produce this effect with certainty.  Fi?. 71. The thickness of the glass jar, fig. 71, is about 1 line  each coating has a surface of about 9 square decimetres,  and the uncoated border is 22 centimetres in height.  I have not studied carefully the influence of the thick-  ness of the glass upon the effects of the discharge stroke.  and only make this notice in order to draw the attentioD  of other physicists to the point. It is much to be wishec  that Eiess would take up this subject, since he has already  _ labored in this field with such generally acknowledgec  good results.    RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 359  I Â§ T2. Electrical figures. â€” By means of electricity, figures can be  produced on the surface of different bodies, which are either directly  ivisible or are rendered visible by strewing dust^ or by breathing upon  ;ieni. Riess has made an extensive series of experiments (Pog. Ann.,  LXIX, l\"! on these phenomena, the best known of which are the  Lichtenberg figures, and he has determined very accurately the cir-  cumstances under which these figures and images appear.  j Riess divides them into primary electrical delineations, or such as  are caused by difi'erent parts on the surface of poorly conducting sub-  stances being placed in unlike electrical condition, and becoming  visible on being sprinkled with powders ; and  [ Secondary electrical delineations, which are produced when the film  pf foreign matter which covers nearly all bodies is affected by the  electrical discharge ; in this case the figures are made to appear by  breathing upon the plate, or else visible marks may appear imme-  diately, if the surface of the body itself has been in any way attacked.  I We shall first consider the figures made visible by sprinkling pow-  |ier upon them.  1 Â§ 73. Dust figures. â€” To produce the Lichtenberg figures Riess used  square copper plates, covered on one or both sides with a coat of pitch  ubout i line thick.  j The formation of dust figures (Lichtenberg figures) is a consequence  pf the electroscopic action of electrified spots on the resinous surface  upon the powder itself, electrified by shaking in the bag through  which it is sifted. A mixture of flour of sulphur and minium is best  jfor this purpose. Positively electrified places on the plate are covered  iwith the sulphur, and therefore appear yellow ; the minium, on the  contrary, is collected on the negative spots, which thus ap])ear red.  I The spark having passed over the pitch surface, so that a dust  l^gure would have appeared if it had been immediately dusted, no  figure will be formed if the pitch surface is first exposed for a second  ^o the flame of a spirit lamp, by which the electricity is removed from  ^he plate.  . The simplest mode of producing dust figures is the following, used  also by Riess : A copper plate, covered on one side only with pitch, is  â€¢touched by a conductor, and an insulated metallic point is placed on  \"the pitch surface. The upper end of the point being touched by the  knob of B. -positively charged jar, remove the insulated point, and on  [powdering with the above described mixture a round yellow sun, with  idense rays, will appear.  i The experiment being conducted in the same manner with a nega-  tively charged jar, a perfectly red circular disk will appear.  : This diversity in the appearance of the figures is well known ; but  ^Riess has directed attention to another remarkable distinction, namely,  [that the positive figure is much larger than the negative, though  iequally strong charges have been used.  [ With a given 'positive charge of the jar the yellow sun had (as a  imean of 3 experiments) a diameter of 16.1 millimetres.  With an equally strong negative charge the red disk had a diame-  ter (also a mean of 3 experiments) of 5.8 millimetres.  The diameters of the negative and positive figures, produced by   360 RECENT PROGEESS IN PHYSICS.  equally strong charges of the jar, are, consequently, in the ratio of 1  to 2.77, or the surfaces covered by them are as 1 to 7.67.  A plate, coated on both sides with pitch, on being brought between  the insulated point and the conducting wire, and subjected to the  above process, the positive figure appears on one side and the negative  on the other.  When the jar was charged with negative electricity, the disk ap-  peared above and the sun below, but the j-ellow sun in this case was;  only 2.2 times as large as the red disk.  The cause ot the negative figures being relatively greater than in  the previous experiment was owing to the excess of negative elec-  tricity, which was transmitted tÂ© the upper surface ; in fact, a sun ap-j  peared on the upper side, which was 3.3 times as great as the redt  disk on the under side, when a positively charged jar was used in a  similar experiment.  Riess has shown that the dust figures appear only when the passage-  of electricity on the insulating plate is accompanied by a discontinuous!  discbarge, which may be recognized generally by a peculiar hissing.;  By holding the j3itched plate to the knob of a charged jar a sparki  passes with a crashing noise ; a discontinuous discharge thus takeS'  place, and a figure appears on dusting; but the plate being placed  at such a distance from the knob of the jar that a spark cannot pass,  some electricity still gradually goes over, producing a continuous dis-  charge. If the plate is dusted after standing from 30 to 70 minutes  opposite the knob of the jar, a number of round spots appear irregu-  larly distributed â€” yellow, if the jar had a positive, red, if a negative^  charge. These spots exhibit no trace of rays ; they are perfectly alike  in size and form for both electricities.  Hence, electrical dust figures aiDpear when electricity is transmitted hy  a discontinuous discharge to an insulathig plate.  Upon this fact Riess founds a very ingenious explanation of the  diff'erence between positive and negative dust figures. In a discon-  tinuous discharge passing over the surface of an insulator the con-  densed atmosphere, which covers the surface of all bodies, is forcibly  penetrated, and a part of the stratum, containing vapor of water, if  projected wiih violence against the surface of the body.  But Faraday has shown that, if moist air impinges forcibly againsl  any body, the latter is negatively electrified; thus, then, in this case''  the surface of the plate becomes negatively electrified in consequencf  of the discharge which takes place over the surface; the remaining  electricity of this discharge then has only to spread over a negatively  electrified insulating surface.  The surface being charged with negative electricity, it spreads froir  the point over an insulating surface already negative ; the circum  stances, therefore, not being favorable for the distribution of the nega-  tive electricity the figure cannot become enlarged, and a roundec  form is assumed.  The jar being positively charged, the remainder of the positive  charge spreads from the point over an insulating surface negatively  * The experiments of Faraday referred to, scarcely allow of such a conclusion. â€” (Se'  Report for 1856, p. 364.) G. C. S.   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 361  electrified by the discontinuous discharge ; the fact that electricity is  already present on the surface, acting attractingly on that issuing  from the point, occasions a greater diffusion of the positive electricity ;  but the circumstance that the positive electricity spreading forth is  i[>artially neutralized by the presence of the negative, causes the radia-  ting form of the positive dust figure.  i To sustain this view^ Riess produced a modification of the phenome-  iQon in rarified air. On a plate covered with pitch, placed under a  glass receiver, was placed the blunt end of a wire, which received a  3park from a jar charged with positive electricity. With the whole  pressure of the air the sun appeared on dusting the plate ; but when  |the air was exhausted to 27^ lines pressure, only an irregular yellow  ^peck appeared ; negative electricity behaved in like manner. The  diflerence between the positive and negative figures was no longer  pbserved at this degree of rarifaction.  I When the air was exhausted to 2 or 3 lines the end of the wire left  j&nly a point, which, luith positive electricity ivas red, with negative^  yellow ; and consequently caused, not by the transmission of electricity  to the plate, but by induction.  : The penetration of the stratum of air surrounding the plate is,  therefore, the origin of dust figures.  I Â§ 74. Dust images. â€” If a stamp (as simple as possible, having a few  ^â€¢aised letters, and for this reason printing types will answer) be  blaced on a single pitch plate, (so Riess calls a copper disk coated on  Sne side only with pitch,) and electricity be communicated to the  ^tamp, it acts inductively on the pitch surface, the latter becoming  electrified at the spot where touched ; and this electricity is opposite  Ito that of the stamp, for on removing it and powdering the plate with  the mixture mentioned already, a red image of the letter is obtained,  [if the stamp is positive ; a yellow one, if negative ; for the flcur of  Sulphur attaches itself to the positive,, the minium powder to the nega-  jtive spots of the resin plate.  [ The above described phenomenon underwent numerous modifica-  jtions, according to the manner in which the stamp was electrified.  \\ The stamp being touched by the knob of a charged Ley den jar,  and then removed in an insulated condition, leaves au image as above  indicated ; it is, however, very little covered with dust ; while the  ground, by the formation of dust figures becomes yellow, if the letter  is red, or red, if the letter is yellow.  The stamp being removed uninsulated, the dust figure changes,  ^hereby the clearness of the image also suffers.  By electrifying too strongly, an actual passage of electricity in part  occurs at the place where the stamp touches the plate^ so that a dust  image appears, partly red and partly yellow.  I Then we have at the same time a dust image and dust figures. To  (obtain the dust image clearly, the formation of the dust figures must  be avoided, which Riess accomplished in various ways.  ! The knob of a Leyden jar was exchanged for a four-inch ball, and  rthe jar fastened horizontally, so that the pitch plate and the stamp  jcould be placed under the ball ; the stem of the stamp was half an inch  from the ball. By the inductive action of the ball the end of the stamp   362 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  touching the pitch was electrified like the ball : too strong an accumu-  lation of electricity was prevented by providing the stamp with a point.  After the stamp had been exposed from 20 to 30 minutes to the induc-  tive action of the ball, a clear dust image appeared without any dust  figure, but irregular spots ajjpeared in the ground, which were not of  the color of the image.  Similar results were obtained when the stamp was placed for several  hours in connexion with one pole of a powerful dry pile, while the i  electricity of the other pole was conducted off as completely as possible, t  In these cases, in which generally no dust figures appeared, it was i  indifferent whether the stamp was insulated or not, on its removal.  The color of the irregular spots showed that they originated in the i  electricity actually passing from the stamp to the pitch plate at the :  places which admitted of a slight current. To avoid these, more ready  passage to a conducting medium must be furnished for this electricity, ,  as in the case when the dust images were produced in rarified air. i  Kiess obtained in this manner the most perfect dust images.  The dust Jigtii^es and images, just considered, are, according to Riess, ;  primary electrical delineations ; the figures and images now to be con- i  sidered are secondary electrical delineations.  Â§ 75. Electrical breath figures. â€” The surface of glass, mica, &c., .  over which an electrical discharge stroke has passed, gives, by breathing  upon it, peculiar ramified figures, which stand out from the surface  obscured by the breath with a mirror-like lustre.  The breath figure indicates the path taken by the electrical dis-  charge over the surface ; and its form difiers therefore, according to  the nature of this surface. On metal, it appears as a round disk ; on  resin, as serpentine stripes ; on mica, as fine, many times ramified  lines.  The breath figure is independent upon the hind of electricity em-  ployed.  That these figures do not originate in the electricity which continues  to adhere to the surface is established by the fact that they are seen  on metallic surfaces, on which they appear after the breathing, as  distinct circles, surrounded by more or less obscure rings ; the breath i  figures also appear a long time after the discharge stroke has passed i  over the surface, or after the surface has been passed over the flame of >  a spirit lamp. Hence, the breath figures cannot be owing to adhering â–   electricity ; they are to he ascribed to a change of surface ivhich the sub-  stance used has been subjected to, by the electrical discharge.  On a fresh surface of mica, that is on such as is obtained by a fresh  cleavage, breath figures do not appear. This depends upon a peculiar i  property of fresh mica surface, which Riess has described in the 67th  volume of Poggendorf's Annalen, page 354.  A clean plate of mica being breathed on, or held over evaporating  water, the result is, as with all bodies, that it will be covered with a  rapidly disappearing stratum of water, consisting of very small drops,  which are not in contact with each other.  But when the mica has received a fresh surface by cleavage, it re-  mains perfectly clear, shining and transparent after being breathed on.  This phenomenon is by no means owing to the fresh surface not   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 363  condensing vapor of water, for the breath causes it to show the colors  'of thin plates ; it is consequently covered with a coherent stratum of  'water.  ' A drop of water which stands at rest on an old surface of mica at  â– once spreads on a fresh surface, and completely covers it. Hence, a  :mica surface made by cleavage possesses, in consequence of its great  [purity, so great an attraction for the vapor of water that it condenses  'the water into a coherent stratum, while, had the mica been exposed  'a long-time to the air, it would have condensed the water in separate  'drops.  While an old surface of mica is an excellent insulator of electricity  a, fresh surface discharges an electroscope in a few seconds ; it acts  Ihygroscopically by condensing the vapor of water of the atmosphere  into a coherent stratum, which conducts electricity.  This remarkable peculiarity of fresh mica is preserved but a short  ftime in the air ; in a few days it may be clouded by breathing upon it.  f Very powerful electrical discharges produce not only a change in  lithe film of foreign matter covering the body, but they alter the surface  lof the body itself. This is the cause of the traces noticed in Â§ 41, occa-  isioned by the discharge spark on glass and mica (electrical colored  istripes) and of the rings of Priestley , which occur when numerous dis-  charges of a battery take place between a point and a polished metallic  jSurface, whereby oxidation of the metal forms many colored concentric  circles.  Â§76. Karsten's Electrical Figures. â€” The analogy which Eiess de-  tecribes in the VI volume of Dove's Repertorium der Pliysih, between  lelectrical breath figures and the images of Moser, occasioned Karsten  rto examine whether such images could not be obtained in the electrical  way.  I For this purpose he placed (Pog. Ann., LVII, 492) a coin on a  imirror, resting on a discharging metal plate, and caused sparks to  Istrike from the conductor of the machine upon the coin, thence passing  !lto the metal plate, (around the edge of the glass.) After 100 revo-  llutions of the machine the coin was removed ; the glass plate seemed  jwhoUy unchanged, but when breathed upon the image of the coin  ^appeared distinctly.  ' Besides the memoir cited, Karsten has published two others, in  ;Poggeudorf 's Annalen, (LVIII, 115, and LX, 1,) on electrical images,  â€¢but as he has not succeeded in discovering their true nature, it is un-  jnecessary to go further into the details of these memoirs ; and the more,  jsince Riess, as we shall see, has correctly ascertained the condition for  ^producing electrical images. The report upon Riess' researches will  ^therefore suffice to bring the facts at least, to the knowledge of the  (reader.  We must, however, briefly notice, by the way, Karsten's last treatise  in one particular. In the beginning he adduces many experiments  'which have been made to explain the cause of Moser's images ; besides  iMoser's own theory, he presents the opinion of Hunt, Know, Fizeau,  'Daguerre, Masson and Moore. Why is the excellent work of Waideles  fon this subject ignored ? it appears in the first half of the 59th vol-  â– ume of Poggendorf 's Annalen, and after these images had been the   364 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  occasion of numerous theoretical extravaganzas, brought us back to  the basis of a rational treatment of the subject. Could Karsten not  have known of this work in drawing up the papers in the 60th volume  of the Annalen f  The explanation which Karsten gives of Moser's images is altogether  inadmissible and may be easily refuted. He thinks that, because similar  images can be produced by the aid of electricity, Moser's images must  be of electrical origin. He thinks that ' ' if two bodies, differing in any  respect from each other, come in contact, an electrical current is pro-  duced!\" and that this is the cause of Moser's images.  The generation of an electrical current by the contact of two hetero-  geneous bodies, which Karsten seems to intimate in this passage, will  not be granted by the most zealous of the adherents of the contact  theory ; but granting even the existence of such a current, it could  not produce any image, as the researches of Kiess prove.  That electrical tension alone, without repeated discharges between  the body and the plate, is not sufficient to produce electrical images  has been shown by Know in a paper \"On electrical figures and ther-  mography,\" (Pog. Ann., LXI, 569,) in which he has proved the  untenableness of Karsten's view as to the electrical origin of Moser's  images.  The rest of the contents of Know's memoir will be mentioned sub-  sequently in the proper place.  Â§ 77. Electrical breath images. â€” Eiess placed a metal stamp on a  shining pitch surface, and upon the stamp a small metal weight con-  nected by a silver wire with the knob of the spark micrometer, receiving  electricity directly from the conductor of the machine, while the other  knob of the spark micrometer, one-half line from the first, was in con-  ducting connexion with the ground.  The machine being now turned, electricity accumulates upon the  first knob of the micrometer and upon the stamp, until a discharge  takes place by the passage of a spark between the two knobs ; con-  tinued turning will charge and discharge the stamp anew. The  discharges follow more rapidly the closer the knobs of the spark  micrometer are together.  After several revolutions of the machine the stamp may be removed,  the plate breathed upon, when a shining image of the stamp shows  itself on the dull ground.  It is indifferent for the success of this experiment which electricity  is used.  Such images may also be produced on glass and mica, but on these  substances they are often imperfect.  The simple breath image, Riess says, in caused by repeated electri-  cal discharges taking place in opposite directions between the model  and the insulating plate. The electricity communicated to the model  passes over to the plate, then back to the model, when the latter is  discharged by the spark micrometer ; thus a motion of the same kind  of electricity arises, first downward and thus upward. Since the dis-  charges between a bad and a good conductor are never perfect, elec-  tricity, both of the kind used and the opposite kind, remain upon the   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 365  iiisiilating plates, which are therefore in the condition to produce dust  â– figures, oiten even dust images.  ; By simply eltctritying the stamp, the arrangement being the same  las for producing dust images, no breath image appears. The alter-  nate charge and discharge of the stamp are essentially necessary for  ithe formation of these images.  I By laying a plate of mica on a pitch plate, and placing a metal  \"stamp on this^ a double discharge of the same kind of electricity takes  'place in the same direction in electrifying the stamp, namely, from  the stamp to the upper surface of the mica, and from the under sur-  'face of the mica to the pitch plate. When a spark is communicated  to the stamp from a positively charged jar, the pitch surface, when  Sdusted, shows a yellow image of the stamp, surrounded by positive  dust figures. If, therefore, in this arrangement of the stamp alternate  â– charges and discharges are brought about, the conditions for forming  Manifold breath images are fulfilled.  i A pitch surface being covered with a mica plate and a stamp placed  bn it, the latter was charged and discharged by the spark micrometer.  After twenty revolutions the upper surface of the mica showed a per-  fect breath image, but the under surfaces and that of the pitch pre-  isented a most imperfect one.  I These images are so frequently imperfect because pitch and mica  jadhere closely together in consequence of the electricity remaining  after each discharge and subsequent discharges is conveyed to places  'which lie scattered beyond the image surface ; but a metallic plate  being substituted for the pitch plate, a perfect breath image is ob-  tained on the upper and lower surfaces of the mica and on the metallic  teurtace.  I The visibility of the breath images is to be explained, according to  fRiess, by the fact that the surfaces are freed by electrical discharges  Jirom the film of foreign matter with which they are generally covered ;  iand he has even proved such a cleansing of the surface by images on  [metal. On a perfectly insulating mica surface Iliess produced a breath  iimage, and the place where the image appeared conducted as well as  !a fresh surface of mica, thus showing that it had been freed from the  letratum covering this spot.  ; In most cases breath images are produced by such a cleansing  action, but they can be excited also by soiling the plate.  i On a fresh mica surface an obscure image of a stamp was obtained  jpn a shining ground. On an old surface, which electrified by forty  fTevolutions, gave a bright breath image; one hundred revolutions  ij)roduced a dull image.  I The various kinds of dull breath images depend upon the condition  lof the plate used and of the stamp, and also upon the strength of the  ielectricity ; the clear images appear more frequently only because  jfioiled plates and the least possible electricity are generally used,  I The origin of the breath images, like that of the breath figures, is  ito be ascribed to a change which the electrical discharge produces in  'the stratum covering the plate, and consists in an increase or diminu-  ition of this stratum, according to circumstances.  ' A spark thrown upon a metallic surface injures it when perfectly   366 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  clean, but leaves it unchanged if it is soiled or tarnished. Thisistlie  case, in forming breath images on metals. A very small number of dis-  charges having passed between a metallic surface and one of m'ca  covering it, the intermitting discharge begins in the foreign stratum  on the surface of the metal, and the metal remains uninjured ; but  when the stratum is destroyed, and the breath image is produced, and  the discharges are continued, the latter then begin on the metal itself,  which is thus changed. Such images, appearing without breathing,  and representing some parts of the stamp in brownish colors, Riess  produced on silver with from fifty to sixty revolutions.  Â§ 78. Electrolytic images. â€” If the blunt point of a platinum needle  be placed on a paper moistened with a solution of iodide of potassium,  and lying on a metallic plate connected with the ground, a brown  spot will appear under the point if the needle is electrified positively,  but there will be no spot if it be negatively electrified. Using positive  and negative electricity one after the other in any order, the coloring  remains even when the quantity of negative electricity far exceeds  that of the positive.  This fact explains the electrolytic images, which Riess has invented  for proving the correctness of the view presented above, on the forma-  tion of breath images by alternating discharges.  A piece of card paper, moistened on one surface with a solution of  iodide of potassium, was laid on a metallic plate connected with the  ground, and then covered with a plate of mica. A stamp was placed on  the mica, and, being loaded with a weight of 2 to 14 ounces, was con-  nected with the spark micrometer, whose knobs were \\ a line asunder.  After twenty revolutions of the machine, positive electricity continuing  to pass between the knobs, a very sharp image appeared on the paper  in which the letters of the stamp appeared with a brown color.  The explanation of this phenomenon, according to the above, is easy.  As in breath images, the stamp being charged with positive electricity,  it passes from the lower surface of the mica to the metal plate, and  thence through the moist paper ; by this passage of the -j- ^^ f o the  metal plate the iodide of potassium is decomposed ; as soon as a dis-  charge takes place between the knobs of the spark micrometer, an op-  posite current sets in between the metal plate and the mica ; the -{- E  now returns to the mica, and the â€” E through the moist disk to the  metal. While the -f- E goes to the metal the iodide of potassium is  decomposed, and this eft'ect is not destroyed by the discharge in the  opposite direction.  It is to be remarked that the passage of the -\\- E from the mica to  the metal takes place gradually, while the discharge in the opposite  direction happens instantaneously.  The same experiment being repeated in the same manner with â€” E,  no image is obtained, but only irregular brown spots.  This also may be easily explained ; the negative electricity goes  gradually to the metallic plate, while the passage in the opposite di-  rection is instantaneous ; thus, a greater quantity of positive elec-  tricity returns at once to the metal plate, and passes more readily to  such points as lie beyond the image surface.  To obtain an image with negative electricity, care has only to be   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   367   Itaten that the quantity of -|- E which returns on the discharge between  the knobs to the metal plate, shall be less, which is attained bj bring-  ing the knobs of the spark micrometer closer together.   SECTION FOURTH.   ELECTRICAL SPARK AND BRUSH.  Â§ 79. Faraday's researches on the spark and brush. â€” Without going  into the theoretical disquisition, mentioned in another place,* which  iFaraday has given upon the spark and brush, T will present here only  the most important facts which he has obtained in his experiments  Jupon these phenomena of light. â€” (Pog. Ann., XL VII and XL VIII.)  I In order to compare the resistance which different gases presented  ito the passage of sparks, with the corresponding resistance of the air,  'Faraday used an apparatus, a sketch  \"of which is represented in fig. 72 Fig. 72.  Two small knobs, s and S, connected  with the conductor of an electrical  â– machine, were placed opposite to two  larger knobs, I and L, in conducting  -connexion with the ground. The  diameter of the balls was as follows:   iBall s 0.93 of an inch.  Ball^ 0.96 \"  Ball 1 2.02 \"  iBallZ 1.95 \"   ;   c   (   V  j9   ^    I The constant interval v between s  and I was 0.62 of an inch ; the inter-  (val w between S and L was variable.  I It would have been better if the  itwo small balls s and IS had been  perfectly equal in size, and I and L  ,al80 equal; much more reliable con-  clusions could then have been drawn  from these experiments.  The two balls 5 and I were placed  in a receiver, which could be exhaust-  jUdand then filled with dilferent gases.  ' The receiver being filled with air under the pressure of the atmos-  ;phere, the sparks passed alternately at u and v, when the intervals at  â– u were between 0.6 and 0.79 inches. When the interval at u was less  jthan 0.6 the sparks always passed here, but if it was greater than  ;0.79 the sparks then always passed at v.   See Â§ 24 in the Report for 1856.   368   KECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   Similar results were obtained when other gases were in the receiver  under the atmospheric pressure. There were two limits for the in-  terval at w, between which the spark passed at one time at u, at  another at v; the interval at u being less than the least of these lim-  iting numbers, the spark passed always at u, but being greater than  the greatest of these numbers it always took place at v.

That within certain limits of distance at u the spark takes place  alternately at u or v, and consequently that there is not a single per-  manent value of 10 for each gas, over which the spark always happens  at V, but under always at u, depends upon accidents (such as particles  of dust floating in the air) of which we can give no account.  If at one of the intervals a spark once passed there was generally a  strong tendency in it to appear at the same interval again.  It is a remarkable circumstance that the range of distance u should  be much less when s and S are negative than when these balls are   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   369   psitive.

It appears clearly from these experiments that different gases have  Bt equal capacities for insulation. Considering the mean values of  t (for positive charges of * and S,) we perceive that a stratum 0.62 of  a inch of â€”   Oxygen  Nitrogen  Hydrogen  Carbonic acid  Olefiant gas  Coal gas  Muriatic acid gras   insulates as well as a stratum  of air, whose thicknes is   0.505  0.615  0.370  0.640  0.750  0.490  1.105   tat is, an electrical discharge passes as easily through a stratum of  ar 0.370 of an inch thick, as through one of hydrogen of 0.62 of an  ich ; an electrical spark penetrates a stratum of air 1. 105 inch thick as  elsily as one of 0.62 of an inch of muriatic acid gas; an electrical  s|ark passes with decidedly more ease through oxygen, hydrogen, and  cal gas than through an equal stratum of air ; but muriatic acid  Â§s and olefiant gas present a decidedly greater resistance to the trans-  Eission of the spark than an equal thickness of air does.  iSimilar results were obtained from later but less reliable experi-  rents.â€” (Pog. Ann., XLYIII, 281.)  iThe mean values of w are not equal with positive and negative  trges of S and s ; for many gases u has a greater mean value with  ositive charge of S and s than with a negative; for other gases it  i<the reverse; but to draw the conclusion from these experiments that  r|iny gases more readily allow the negative and others the positive  (^charge through them, seems to me unwarranted, because the differ-  , elces of the above table in this respect are within the limit of errors  q observation.  . fThus, according to the table given above, the mean value of w with  , positive charge of s and ^ is, for â€”  ' 24 s   370 RECENT PROGEESS IN PHYSICS.  Hydrogen , 0.37  Carbonic acid , 0.64  Olefiant gas 0.75  while Faraday obtained from a subsequent series of experiments, sim-  ilarly arranged, the following values:  Hydrogen , 0.40  Carbonic acid 0.78  Olefiant gas 0.96  Evidently the corresponding values of m, obtained by positive charges i  of s and S , and which should be exactly equal, differ as much from i  each other as the corresponding values for the positive and negative â€¢â– '  charges of s and S; from which it appears that we are justified in assign- i  ing no great value to these differences. But there is a further reason <  for ascribing these differences to errors of observation, arising from  the fact that when air is in the receiver, and the spark accordingly takes ;  l)lace throughair, the positive and negative mean values for u are found <  unequal, namely: with s and S positive u =z 0.695 ; with s and 8 >.  negative u = 0.635. These differences can be ascribed only to acci- i  dental disturbances, which produce the errors of observation ; for why  should the spark, with a positive charge of s and S, pass more  easily through the air at v, and with a negative charge, more easily  at u, also through the air? Air being in the receiver, and + and â€”  charges imparted to s and 8, the values for u would be nearly identi- ^  cal, unless the errors of observation were too considerable,  Faraday himself does not consider these experiments decisive in this  respect, but brings forward some facts which seem to indicate some  such difference between the positiveand the negative discharge; making  w =: 0.8 of an inch, and filling the receiver with muriatic acid gas,  the discharge always took place, with a positive discharge of s and S,  at u, through air, but with a negative charge of s and S at v, through  the muriatic acid gas.  It also appeared that when the conductor was connected only with  the muriatic acid gas apparatus the discharge occurred more readily '  with a negative discharge of the small ball s than with a positive ; for )  in the latter case much of the electricity passed off as brush discharge ;  through the air from the connecting wire ; but in the fl^rmer case it '  allseemed to go through the muriaticacid. â€” (Pog. Ann., XLVII, 287.)  Â§ 80. Unequal striking distances of positive and negative discharge.â€”  Many known phenomena coincide in showing that positive and nega-  tive discharges do not take place with equal facility. When a small  ball, connected with the conductor and thus made inductive, is placed â–   opposite a larger one, which is uninsulated, a spark is obtained twice Â«  as long, the conductor being charged positively, as when negatively i  charged.  Faraday has closely investigated this phenomenon, and obtained  the following facts :  He passed the discharges between two balls of the respective diame-  ters of 2 inches and 0.25 of an inch. The larger ball being connected I   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   371   ritb the conductor, and thus made inductive, there appeared with a  lositive conductor â€” â–   parks alone up to an interval of 0.49 in.  ^legative brush, from the small ball alone, when the inter-  val was greater than ,. 0.52 'â€¢  \"With a negative conductor â€”  Iparks alone up to an interval of 1.15 \"  Positive brush, from the small ball alone, when the interval  I was greater than 1.G5 â€¢\"  I Between these limits he obtained sparks and brushes mixed.  * The balls were then exchanged, the small ball being connected with  jhe conductor, and the large one uninsulated. The result with a  ijositive conductor was â€”  Sparks alone to an interval of. 0.4 in.  f^egative brush alone, when the interval was greater than.. 0.44 \"  i From these experiments it follows that â€”  ! 1. Longer sparks are obtained when tlie small ball is positively  [ilectrified.  I 2. Longer sparks are obtained when the large ball is the inducing,  Lnd the small one th\" inducteous ball.  ! When the small ball discharges electricity in the form of brushes,  Ihey are much more numerous, and each one seems to carry ofi'.much  less electrical force when the discharged electricity is negative than  pirhen positive.  I This appears to indicate that a small ball requires a greater tension  for discharging when positive than when negative.  \\ To illustrate this important point, Faraday arranged an apparatus,  hpresented in fig. 73. A fork. A, carrying a large and a Fi?. 73.  f^mall ball, was connected with the conductor of a machine ;  ft perfectly similar fork, B, was connected with a discharg-  ing train ; the small ball on each fork was placed opposite  Lihe larger one on the other. The intervals at n and were  ?qual. The conductor being negative, the discharge al-  [ways happened at n, which is not surprising, because the  liegative charge of the small inducing ball at n is always  Wronger than the positive charge of the small inductions  iball at 0. But had the discharge taken place at o with a  Ijositive cl large of the conductor, it would have appeared  [that the weak negative charge of the small inducteous  Iball discharges with greater facility than the far stronger  positive charge of the small inducing ball at n, which  jwould have been a decisive proof of the more facile dis-  icharge of negative electricity. But such a decisive result  jthe experiments did not give ; when the intervals at n and  :0 were 0,9 of an inch, or 0.6, the discharge always took  place at n, whether the conductor was positive or negative.  The interval n being made 0.79 and 0.58 of an inch, if the con-  ductor was positive, the discharge at both w and was about equal,  }jUt if negative, the discharges mostly happened at n, which signified,    S72 RECENT 'PROGEESS IN PHYSICS.  evidently, that the small ball discharged in the negative state some- '  what mure easily than in the positive, yet their result is not perfectly)  decisive,  A contrivance, similar to that of fig. 73, was placed inside a glass i  vessel, which conld be filled with different gases. With equal inter- i  vals at n and o, Faraday obtained quite decided results for carbonic ;|  acid. When the conductor was positive the discharge took place i  mostly at o, when negative always at n ; here, then, the negative dis- r  charge was decidedly the more easy, and in coal gas the preponderance i  {â€¢f the negative discharge was just as decided. In air and in oxygen r:  the greater facility of the negative discharge appeared -somewhat .1'  doubtful ; in nitrogen and in hydrogen there appeared some probability vj  of an opposite relation.  Belli has made experiments, from which it follows that negative i  electricity escapes more easily into air than positive. â€” (Pog. Ann,  XXXV, 73.)  After fastening a quadrant electrometer on a horizontal insulated 1  conductor and electrifying it 'positively, he found, as a mean of three :â– '  experiments, that the electrometer required a period of ten minutes *  to sink from 20Â° to 10Â° ; but with negative electricity only 4.5  minutes were re(][uired.  Â§ 81. Sparks in different gases. â€” The phenomena attendant on sparks  in different gases have been often observed and described. Faraday  has made experiments on this subject also, and describes them in the  twelfth series of his Experimental Kesearches. â€” (Pog. Ann. XLVII,  536.)  The gases were under the pressure of the atmosphere ; the sparks  passed between brass balls.  \" In air,\" says Faraday, \" the sparks have that intense light and  bluish color which are so well known, and often have iaint or dark  parts in their course, when the quantity of electricity passing is not  great,  \" In nitrogen they are very beautiful, having the same general ap-  pearance as in air, but have decidedly more color, of a bluish or purple  character, and, as I thought, were remarkably sonorous.  \"In oxygen the sparks were whiter than in air or nitrogen, and I  think not so brilliant.  \"In hydrogen they had a very fine crimson color\" â€” \"very little  sound was produced in this gas.\"  \" In carhcnic acid gas the color was similar to that of the spark in  air, but with a little green in it. The sparks were remarkably irregu-  lar in form, more so than in common air.  \" In muriatic acid gas the spark was nearly white. It was always  bright throughout, never presenting those dark spots which happen in  air, nitrogen^ and other gases.  \"In coal gas the spark was sometimes green, sometimes red, and  occasionally one part was green and another red ; black parts also  occurred very suddenly in the line of the spark.\"  Sparks may be obtained in media, which are far denser than air â€”  as in oil of turpentine, olive oil, resin, glass, spermaceti, water, &c.   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 373  Â§ 82. The electrical brush. â€” The most important facts which Fara-  day has obtained in reference to the brush are the following,) Poff.  Ann.,XLVII:)  '' The brush and spark gradually pass into each other.\" (Faraday  calls the electrical brush \" a spark to air.\") \" Making a small ball  positive by a good electrical machine with a large prime conductor,  and approaching a large uninsulated discharging ball towards it, very  beautiful variations from the spark to the brusli mav be obtained.  The drawings of long and powerful sparks, given by Van Marura,  (description of the large machine in Taylor's museum, Grerman trans-  lation of 1786, Tab._ III, fig. 1 ;) Harris, (Phila. Trans., 1834, p. 243,)  and others, also indicate the same phenomena,\" namely, a ramification  of the spark by which its transition to the brush is made. â€” (Fara-  day's Researches, Â§ 1448.)  \"If an insulated conductor, connected with the positive conductor of  an electrical machine, have a metal rod 0.3 of an inch in diameter  projecting from it outwards from the machine and terminating by a  rounded end or a small ball, it will generally give good brushes ; or  if the machine be not in good action, then many ways of assisting  the formation of the brush can be resorted to ; thus, the hand or any  large conducting surface may be approached towards the termination ;\"  \" or the termination may be smaller and of badly conducting matter,  as wood ; or sparks may be taken between the prime conductor and  the secondary conductor, to which the termination giving brushes  belongs;\" ''or the air around the termination may be rarefied.\" â€”  (1425.)  That the brush is not a continuous discharge is evinced in the  gradual transition of the spark to the brush. By proper proportion,  in the size of the small knob to the power of the machine, brushes are  obtained which show immediately that they consist of ramified sparks  rapidly following each other ; the machine being worked more rapidly,  or with the same working of the machine substituting a still smaller  discharging knob, the brush assumes a more uniform appearance,  which Faraday very well describes in the following words : \"A short  conical bright part or root appeared at the middle part of the ball,  projecting directly from it, which, at a little distance from the ball^  broke out suddenly into a wide brush of pale ramifications, having a  quivering motion, and being accompanied at the same time with a  low, dull, chattering sound.\" â€” (1426.)  At first such a brush seems continuous, but Wheatstone has shown  that it consists of successive intermitting discharges, (Philos. Trans.,  1834, p. 586,) which was to be expected from the gradual transition  of the spark to the brush. Faraday gives a very simple method for  decomposing the apparently continuous brush into its elementary  parts without the help of Wheatstone's rotating mirror ; he says : \"If  the eye be passed rapidly, not by a motion of the head, but of the  eyeball itself, across the direction of the brush, by first looking stead-  fastly about 10Â° or 15Â° above, and then instantly as much below it,  the general brush will be resolved into a number of individual  brushes.\" â€” (1427.) This method of analyzing has not succeeded  perfectly in my trials.   374 KECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  \"â–  On using a smaller ball, the general brush, was smaller, and the  sound, though weaker, more continuous. On resolving the brush into  its elementary parts as before these were found to occur at much  shorter intervals.  \" Employing a wire with a round end, the brush was still smaller.,  but, as before, separable into successive discharges. The sound, though  feebler, was higher in pitch, being a distinct musical note.\"  The sound is in fact due to the recurrence of the noise of each  separate discharge, and these happening at intervals nearly equal,  under ordinary circumstances, cause a definite note to be head, whose E  pitch rises with the increased rapidity and regularity of the discharge.  \" By using wires with finer terminations, smaller brushes were  obtained, until they could hardly be distinguished as brushes. But  as long as sound was heard the discharge could be ascertained by the  eye to be intermitting ; and when the sound ceased the light became  continuous as a glow.\"  To those not accustomed to use the eye in the above-described man-  ner, Wheatstone's apparatus with the revolving mirror is recom-  mended. Another excellent process for analyzing the brush is to  produce it on the end of a rod, held in the hand opposite to the prime  conductor, and then move the rod rapidly from side to side, whilst the  eye remains still.â€” (1428â€” 1423.)  Â§ 83. The brush in various gases. â€” The experiments on the brush in  various gases Faraday made with brass rods, about one quarter of ati  inch tliick, and whose rounded ends were placed opposite each other  in a glass globe of seven inches diameter, containing the gas. One  of these rods was connected with the prime conductor, the other with  the ground. â€” (Pog. Ann., XL VII, 553.)  \" Air. Fine positive brushes are easily obtained in air, at common  pressures, possessing the well known purplish light. When the air  is rarefied the ramifications are very long, filling the globe; the light  is greatly increased and is of a beautiful purple color, with an occa-  sional rose tint in it.  \" Oxygen. At common pressures the brush is very close and com-  pressed, and of a dull whitish color. In rarefied oxygen the form and  appearance are better ; the color somewhat purplish, but all the char-  acters very poor compared to those in air.\"  . \"Nitrogen gives brushes with great facility at the positive surface, far  beyond any other gas.\" \" They are almost always fine in form, light,  and color, and in rarefied nitrogen are mao-nificent. They surpass  the discharges in any other gas as to the quantity of light evolved.\"  \" Hydrogen, at common pressures, gives a better brush than oxygen,  but does not equal nitrogen ; the color was greenish gray. In rare-  fied hydrogen the ramifications were very fine in form and distinctness,  but pale in color, with a soft and velvety appearance, and not at all  equal to those in nitrogen. In the rarest state of the gas the color  was a pale gray green.\"  \"Coal gas. The brushes were rather difficult to produce.\" \"They  were short and strong, generally of a greenish color.\" \"In rare  coal gas the brush forms were better, but the light very poor and the  color gray.\"   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 375  'â– ' Carbonic acid produces a very poor brush at common pressures.\"  *' In rarefied carbonic acid the brush is better in form, but weak as to  light, being of a dull greenish or purplish hue.\"  \" 3Iuriatic acid gas. It is very difficult to obtain the brush in this  gas at common pressures. On gradually increasing the distance of  the rounded ends the sparks suddenly ceased ^^hen the interval was  about an inch, and the discharge, which was still through the gas in  the globe, was silent and dark. Occasionally, a very short brush could,  for a few moments, be obtained, but it quickly disappeared. Even  when the intermitting spark current from the machine was used a  brush wa-s obtained with difficulty, and that very short ;\" \"in the  mean time, magnificent brushes were passing off from different parts of  the machine into the surrounding air. On rarefying the gas the forma-  tion of the brush was facilitated, but it was yet of a low, squat form,  very poor in light, and very similar on both the positive and negative  surfaces.\" \"On rarefying the gas still more a few large ramifica-  tions were obtained, of a pale bluish color, utterly unlike those in  nitrogen. ' '-â€”(1456â€”1462.)  Â§84. Brush in denser media. â€” Electrical brushes are produced, not  only in air and gases, but in far denser media. Faraday procured it  in oil of turpentine, (1452,) \" from the end of a wire going through a  glass tube into the fluid, contained in a metal vessel. The brush was  small, and yqxj difficult to obtain; the ramifications were simple,  and stretched out from each other, diverging very much. The light  was exceedingly feeble, a perfectly dark room being required for its  observation. When a few solid particles, as of dust or silk, were in  the liquid, the brush was produced with much greater facility.\"  Â§ 85. Difference of the positive and negative brush discharge. â€” On this  subject I extract the following remarks by Faraday :  \" When the brush discharge is observed in air, at the positive and  negative surfaces, there is a very remarkable difference. ' The differ-  ence in question used to be expressed in former times by saying that  \" a point charged positively gave brushes into the air, whilst the same  point charged negatively gave a star.\" This is true only of bad con-  ductors, or of metallic conductors charged intermittingly. If metallic  points project freely into the air the positive and negative light upon  them differ very little in appearance.\"  These phenomena vary exceedingly under different circumstances,  as Faraday shows :  \" If a metallic wire, with a rounded termination in free air, be used  to produce the brushy discharge, then the brushes obtained when the  wire is charged negatively are very pour and small by comparison with  those produced when the charge is positive. Or if a large metal ball,  connected with the electrical machine, be charged positively, and a  fine uninsulated point be gradually brought towards it, a star appears  on the point when at a considerable distance, which, though it becomes  brighter, does not change its form of a star until it is close up to the  ball ; whereas, if the ball be charged negatively, the point, at a con-  siderable distance, has a star on it as before ; but when brought nearer,   376 RECENT PROGKESS IN PHYSICS,  a brush formed on it, extending to the negative ball ; and when  still nearer, the brush ceased and bright sparks passed.\"  As we have already seen, Â§ 80, the spark discharge passes into the  brush at far less distances if the surface on which the discharge begins  (the small ball or the rounded end of a rod) is negative, than if it is  positive ; but on going further into the succession of charges we find  that the positive brush passes into glow long before the negative.  \" A metal rod 0.3 of an inch in diameter, with a rounded end pro-  brush. It was ascertained, both by sight and sound, that the succesisve  jecting into the air, was charged negatively and gave a short noisy  discharges were very rapid in their recurrence, six or seven times more  numerous than when the rod was charged positively to an equal  degree.\"  ' ' When the rod was positive it was easy, by working the machine  a little quicker, to replace the brush by a glow, but when it was nega-  tive no efforts could produce this change.\" â€” (1468.)  \"A point opposite the negative brush exhibited a star, and, as it was  approximated, caused the size and sound of the brush to diminish, and  at last to cease, leaving the negative end silent and dark, yet effective  as to discharge.\" â€” (1469.)  \" When the round end of a smaller wire was advanced towards the  negative brush, it (becoming positive by induction) exhibited the quiet  glow at eight inches distance, the negative brush continuing. When  nearer, the pitch of the sound of the negative brush rose, indicating  quicker intermittances ; still nearer the positive end threw off ramifi-  cation and distinct brushes, at the same time the negative brush con-  tracted in its lateral direction and collected together, giving a peculiar,  narrow, longish brush, in shape like a hair pencil ; the two brushes  existing at once, but were very different in their form and appearance,  and especially in the more rapid recurrence of the negative discharges  than of the positive. On using a smaller positive- wire for the same  experiment the glow first appeared in it and then the brush, and  the two at one distance became exceedingly alike in appearance.\"  (1470.)  \"In air the superiority of the positive brush is well known. In  nit7'ogen it is as great or even greater than in air. In hydrogen the  positive brush loses a part of its superiority, not being so good as in  nitrogen or air, whilst the negative brush does not seem injured.  In oxygen the positive brush is compressed and poor, whilst the nega-  tive did not become less ; the two were so alike that the eye frequently  could not tell one from the other. In coal gas the brushes are  difficult of production ;\" \" and the positive not much superior to the  negative, either at common or low pressure. In carbonic acid this  approximation of character also occurred. In muriatic acid gas the  positive brush was very little better than the negative.\" â€” (1476.)  Â§ 86. Glow discharge. â€” The glow \" seems to depend upon a quick  and almost continuous charging of the air close to and in contact with  the conductor.\" â€” (Faraday's Researches, 1526.) Faraday was never  able to separate it into visible intermitting elementary discharges.  The glow is produced by â€”  1st. Diminution of the charging surface. â€” At the end of a metal rod   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 377  w.ith a blunt conical point, a phosphorescent continuous glow is ob-  tained the more readily as the point is finer.  2d. Increase of power in the machine. â€” Rounded ends, which give  only brushes when the machine is in weak action, give the glow readily  when the machine is in good order.  3d. Puirefaction of the air. â€” A brass ball 2| inches in diameter  being made positively inductive in an air-pump receiver, became  covered with glow in part, \" when the pressure was reduced to 4.4  inches. By a little adjustment the ball could be covered all over with  this light. Using a brass ball 1.25 inch in diameter, and making  it inducteously positive by an inducti/e negative point, the phenomena  were exceedingly beautiful. The glow came over the positive ball,  and gradually increased in brightness until it was at least very lu-  minous ; and it also stood up, like a low iiame, half an inch or more  in height.\"â€” (1529.)  The negative gloio is difficult to obtain in air at common pressures ;  \" and it is as yet questionable whetber, even on fine points, what is  called the negative star is not a very reduced, but still intermitting  brush, or a glow.\" â€” (15i^0.)  In rarefied air the negative glow can easily be obtained. If the  rounded ends of two metal rods about 0.2 of an inch in diameter  are about four inches apart in rarefied air, the glow can be easily ob-  tained on both rods, covering not only the ends but an inch or two of  the part behind. Balls are also covered with the negative glow in  rarefied air, whether their surface is inductive or inducteous. â€” (1531.)  The glow occurs in all the gases examined for it by Faraday. He  thought he obtained it also in oil of turpentine, though it was very  dull and small.â€” (1534.)  \"The glowis always accompanied by a wind,proceedingeither directly  out from the glowing part or directly towards it ; the former being the  most general case.\" If the arrangements are made so that the ready  and regular access of air to a part exhibiting the glow be interfered  with or prevented the glow then disappears. â€” (1535.)  Frequently it is possible to change the brush given by the end of  a rod into a glow, by simply aiding the formation of a current of air  at its extremity. â€” (1535.)  Â§ 87. Dark discharge. â€” If to the rounded end of a metallic rod pro-  jecting from the prime conductor of a machine a similar rod be held  at a little distance, it is easy to obtain the appearance of light at the  ends of both rods, while the intervening space between the positive  and negative light remains dark ; besides this familiar phenomenon,  Faraday notices a very remarkable case of dark discharge.  '' Two brass rods, 0.3 of an inch in diameter, entering a glass globe  on opposite sides, had their ends brought into contact, and the air  about them very much rarefied. A discharge of electricity from the  machine was then made through them, and while that continued the  ends were separated from each other. At the moment of separation  a continuous glow came over the end of the negative rod, the positive  termination remaining quite dark. As the distance was increased a  purple stream or haze appeared on the end of the positive rod, and  proceeded directly onward towards the negative rod, elongating as the   d75 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  interval was enlarged, but never joining the negative glow, there being  always a short dark space between. This space, of about one-sixteenth or  one-twentieth of an inch was apparently invariable in its extent aind  its position relative to the negative rod ; nor did the negative glow vary.  Whetlier the negative ends were inductive or inducteous the same effect  was produced.\"  Similar phenomena were obtained with balls instead of the rounded  ends of rods.  Â§ 88. Conveciive discliarge. â€” The dielectric being penetrated by the  spark, the brush, and also by the glow, Faraday calls this form of i  discharge the disruptive discharge. With the brush, and still more  with the glow, another form of discharge appears, making itself mani-  fest by the so-called electrical wind. This is owing to the ])article8 of i\\  the dielectric, in close contact with the charged conductor, (on the end '  of the electrified rod,) receiving an electrical charge, in consequence of  which they are repelled ; and by a repetition of this action the conduc-  tor is discharged.  \" Why a point should be so exceedingly favorable to the production  of currents is evident. It is at the extremity of the point that the  intensity necessary to charge the air is first acquired ; it is from thence  that the charged particle recedes ; and the mechanical force which it im-  presses on the air to form a current is in every way favored by the shapes  and position of the rod whose point forms the termination.\" â€” (1573.)  Particles of dust floating in the air favor the escape of electricity.  \" On using oil of turpentine as the dielectric^ the action and course  of small conducting, carrying particles in it, can be well observed.\"  \" A very striking effect was produced on oil of turpentine, which,  whether it was due to the carrying power of the particles in it, or to  any other action of them, is, perhaps, as yet doubtful. A portion of  that fluid in a glass vessel had a large uninsulated silver dish at the  bottom, and an electrified metal rod, with a round termination, dip-  ping into it at the top. The insulation was very good. The rod end,  with a drop of gum water attached to it, was then electrified in the  fluid ; the gum water soon spun off in fine threads, and was quickly  dissipated through the oil of turpentine. By the time that four drops  had in this manner been commingled with a pint of the dielectric, the  latter had lost by far the greatest portion of its insulating power ;\"  \" the fluid was slightly turbid. Upon being filtered through paper  only, it resumed its first clearness, and now insulated as well as be-  fore.\"â€” (1571.)  \"Conducting fluid terminations, instead of rigid points, illustrate in  a very beautiful manner the formation of the currents, with their  effects and influence in exalting the conditions under which they were  commenced. Let the rounded end of a brass rod, 0.3 of an inch, or  thereabouts, in diameter, point downwards in free air ; let it be amal-  gamated and have a drop of mercury suspended from it, and then let  it be powerfully electrized, the mercury will present the [)henomenon  of gloio ; a current of air will rush along the rod and set off from the  mercury directly downwards, and the form of the metallic drop will be  slightly affected, the convexity at a small part near the middle and  lower part becoming greater, whilst it diminishes all round at plac-^'-'  a little removed from this spot.\" â€” (1581.)   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   379    \"Take next ad ro]i of strong solution of miiriateoflime; being  electrified, a part will probably be dissipated, but a con-  siderable portion, if the electricity be not too powerful, will  remain, forming a conical drop, (fig. 74,) accompanied by  a strong wind. If glow be produced the drop will be smooth  on the surface. If a short low brush is formed a minute  tremulous motion of the liquid will be visible.\"  \" With a drop of water the effects were of the same kind, and  were best obtained when a portion of gum water or syrup hung  from a ball, (fig. 75.) When the machine was worked slowly a fine,  large, quite conical drop, with concave lateral outline and a Fig. 75.  small rounded end, was produced, on which the glow appeared,  whilst a steady wind issued from the point of the cone of  sufficient force to depress the surface of uninsulated water  lield opposite to the termination. When the machine v/as  worked more rapidly some of the water was driven off, the  smaller pointed portion left was roughisli on the surface,  and the sound of successive brush discharges was heard,  Witb still more electricity, more water was dispersed ; that which re-  mained was alternately elongated and contracted,'\"' and \"a stronger  brush discharge was heard. Whea water from beneath was brought  towards the drop, it did not indicate the same regular, strong, contracted  current of air as before; and when the distance was such that sparks  passed the water beneath was attracted rather than driven away, and  the current of air ceased.\" â€” (1584.)  \" That the drop, when of water, or a better conductor than water,  is formed into a cone principally by the current of air, is shown,  amongst other ways, thus : A sharp point being held opposite the coni-  cal drop, the latter soon lost its pointed form, was retracted and be-  came round ; the current of air from it ceased, and was replaced by  one from the point beneath, which, if the latter was held near enough  to the drop actually blew it aside and rendered it concave in form.\"  With still worse conductors, as oil, or oil of turpentine, the fluid was  \"spun out into threads and carried off, not only because the air rushing  over its surface helped to sweep it away, but also because its insulating  particles assumed the same changed state as the particles of air, and,  not being able to discharge to them in a much greater degree than  the air particles themselves could do, were carried oft\" by the same causes  which urged these in their course. A similar effect with melted sealing-  wax on a metal point forms an old and well known experiment.\" â€” (1588.)  \"A drop of gum water in the exhausted receiver of the air pump  was not sensibly affected in its form when electrified/' which was  partly owing to the diminished current of air, and partly, perhaps, that  the tension of the electricity on the ball is not so great in rarefied as  in dense air.  \" That I many not be misunderstood,\" says Faraday, \" I must ob-  serve here that I do not consider the cones produced as the result only  of the current of air or other insulating dielectrics over their surface.  When the drop is of badly conducting matter a part of the effect is  due to the electrified state of the particles,\" &c. â€” (1594.)   380   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   \" When tlie phenomena of currents are observed in dense insulating  dielectrics they present us with extraordinary degrees of mechanical  force. Thus, if a pint of well rectified and filtered oil of turpentine |  be put into a glass vessel and two wires be dipped into it in different  places, one leading to the electrical machine and the other to the dis-  charging train, on working the machine, the fluid will be thrown into â–   violent motion, whilst, at the same time, it will rise 2, 3, or 4 inches up Â»  the machine wire, and dart off in jets from it into the air.\" â€” (1595.)  '' A drop of mercury being suspended from an amalgamated brass i  ball preserved its form almost unchanged in air, but when immersed .  in the oil of turpentine it became very pointed and even particles of i\"  the metal could be spun out and carried off. The form of the liquid  metal was just like that of syrup in air.\" â€” (1597.)  \"If the mercury at tlie bottom of the fluid be connected with the  electrical machine, whilst a rod is held in the iiand terminating, in a  ball three quarters of an inch in diameter, and the ball be dipped into  the electrified fluid, very striking appearances ensue. When the ball  is raised again so as to be at a level nearly out of the fluid, large por-  tions of the latter will seem to cling to it, (fig. 76.) If it be raised   Fig. 76.

Laws of the brightness of the electrical spark. â€” Masson pub-  lished in the 14th volume of the Armeies de Chimie et de Physique^  page 129, (1845, 3d part,) his researches upon the brightness of the  electrical spark, under the title : \" Etudes de Photometric Electrique.\"  The ordinary photometre can be used only for permanent and not for  momentary sources of light ; for measuring the brightness of the elec-  trical spark, which gives only a momentary illumination, Masson was   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   381    ;Obliged to contrive a new photometric principle. In fact he solved  â– the problem in a very ingenious manner.  If a disk be divided into sectors equally large ^'\"- \"^â€¢  and alternately black and white, as in fig;. 79,  ;5ind be put into rapid rotation, the different  sectors cannot be distinguished when the disk  is illuminated by a constant source of light ;  but if it be illuminated by an electrical spark  for an instant the sectors of the rotating disk  iwill become visible again, and as much more  ,so as the electrical spark is brighter. But if  |the illumination by the electrical spark be  gradually weakened, while that from the con-  stant source of light remain the same, a point will be attained where  the sectors just cease to be distinguishable, and in this case the power  of the illumination by the electrical spark is a determinate fraction  of the illumination by the constant source, its magnitude depending  lupon the peculiarity of the observer's eye.  J We will now consider in what manner this limit of the ability to  ! distinguish may be ascertained.  A part of a sector on a white disk, (fig.  [80,) being blackened, and the disk turned  rapidly about its centre, the black piece will  form a ring somewhat darker than the white  ground of the disk. The ring will appear as  much fainter as the black spot is narrower,  , and if the experiment be made with a series  of such disks, each successive one having a  narrower black end-portion of a sector m n,  I we will at last finÂ«! one in which the dark  ring ceases to be distinguishable.  Xet us suppose this to be the case when  I the breadth of the sector is y^-q of ^be entire  .circumference; it is evident that the brightness of the ring is less  than the brightness of the disk by jl--^ ; in this case the eye cannot  j distinguish a difi'erence of yio- ^^ illumination.  Masson made his experiments with disks upon which the breadth of  the sectors were ^oj irV, yVj toj ^\\, tj-q, rfoj tIo, of the whole cir-  cumference, and by means of them he found that for weak eyes a  difference of illumination of Jy- to J-^ was the limit of perceptibility.    For ordinary eyes this limit was y-V to   for very good eyes -yoo   to rfo-  On varying tlie intensity of the illumination Masson found that  the sensibility for the same individual did not change if the illumi-  nation was sufficient for reading ordinary print.  The rotating plate being illuminated with colored light, Masson  found that the limit of perceptibility of difference of illumination is  independent of the color.   382   EECEXT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   Fig. 81.   We now pass to the particular object of Masson's investigation.  The arrangement of his experiments was essentially as follows : A  rotating disk, a b, fig. 81, (the rota-  tion being produced by clock-work,)  divided into white and black sectors,  as in fig. 79, was illuminated in the  direction of ^ (7 by the constant light  of a lamp L, which was movable in the  line of this direction. This lamp was  placed in a black case so that it could  throw its light on the rotating disk  only through a tube. In the direc-  tion of the line B C a, movable spark  micrometre F was placed. One of the  knobs of this micrometer was in con-  ducting connexion wi:h the upper  coating of a horizontal glass plate, the  other knob with the lower coating;  the spark always passed between the  two knobs as soon as the charge of the plate had reached a certain  limit, which depended upon the distance of the knobs from each other.  Masson first satisfied himself that, for the instantaneous light of the  electrical spark, the intensity of the illumination was also, as in other  cases, in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance.  The lamp L being at a given distance from the disk a h, the spark  micrometer was gradually removed from the disk, until at the passage  of the spark the sectors of the rotating disk were no longer distin-  guishable, and the distance of the spark from the disk was determined.  The lamp was then moved, and the same experiment repeated, the  distance between the knobs of the spark micrometer remaining un-  changed. The following table gives the results of such an experi-  mental series ; Z denotes the distance of the lamp, Y the correspond-  ing distance of the spark micrometer from the middle of the disk ab:    z.   Y.   z  Y.   tnm.   mm.    540   407   1.32   640   489   1.30   740   569   1.30   840   648   1.29   940   737   1.2S   1040   826   1.25   Mean. .....   1.29      Since Z and Y increase in an equal (or very nearly equal) ratio, it  is evident that, with increasing distances, the illumination for both  sources of light decreases according to the same law; hence the illu-  mination by an electrical spark is likewise inversely proportional to  tiie square of the distance.   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   383   The same result was given by several other series of experiments,  which Masson has arranged in tables. It will be sufficient to present  here only one of the many series, serving to establish each of the laws  determined.  \\ The values of Y, as given in the tables, are always the mean of two  jexperiraents. After the distance Y of the spark micrometer from the  irotating disk at which the sectors could be no longer distinguished  had been once determined the miciometer was brought considerably  inearer the disk again, and then removed the second time, until the  jsector disappeared. The two values of Y, thus determined, differed in  the various series at most by one centimetre, a proof of the exactness  attainable by this method of observation.  Â§ 90. Variation of the brightness of the spark at different strildng  distances.â€” On this point Masson made numerous experiments. The  folio win <x table contains the results of one of them :    X .

It is evident, from the above table, that the striking distance and  the corresponding distance of the spark from the rotating disk must  vary in a constant ratio, the illumination of the disk remaining the  same. Or, for double and treble striking distances, he spark must  be removed two and three times as far from the disk, if its illumina-  tion by the spark is to remain the same.  By doubling the distance, the intensity of the illumination becomes  four times feebler, but it remains unchanged if the striking distance  is doubled, consequently the brilliancy of the spark mus the four times  greater at double the striking distance. For the distance n the illu-  mination by the electrical spark is n- times feebler, but it remains  unchanged if the striking distance is made n times greater ; hence,  for a striking distance n the brilliancy of the spark must be n'^ times  greater, or in other words, the hi^ightness of the electrical spark increases  as the square of the striking distance.  Â§ 91. Influence of the size and form of the surface of the condenser. â€”  The form of the condenser (that is, the glass plate with metallic coat-  ing on both sides, the dif^charge of which passes through the spark   384   RECENT PEOGRESS IN PHYSICS.   micrometer) has no influence upon the brightness of the electrical  spark if the extent of the coating remain the same. The size of the  plate, however, has considerable influence.  With unchanged distance of the constant light and of the striking  distance, and with the same thickness of glass, the surface of the  coating was varied, and each time the corresponding distance of the  spark from the rotating disk, at which the sectors just ceased to be  perceived, was observed. The results of such a series of observations  are given in the following table :   Surface in square  millimetres.   Ratio.   Y.

Comparing the second and fifth columns we have very plainly     (1)   that is, the superficial content F of the coating of the condenser is in  jiroportion to the square of the distance Y, the illumination of the  disk ab by the electrical spark remaining constant.  But the constant illumination of the disk is  J = c Y2  J denoting the intensity of the light of the spark, and c a constant  factor, or   ys   c.

The fol-  lowing table contains a few of the results obtained.

The rediaining experiments which Masson made on this point did  not coincide generally so well with the above deductions. This he  ascribes to the circumstance that he could not measure the thickness  of the glass with sufficient accuracy, and that the different condensers  may have had unequal \"capacities for condensation.\"  Â§ 93. Injiuence of the nature of the pole on the electrical sparh. â€” Mas-  son found that the spark is somewhat more intense, if, under circum-  stances otherwise the same, it be passed between lead, zinc, and tin  balls, than when the balls (equal, in size) are of copper, brass, or iron.  Masson thinks that this depends upon the unequal tenacity of the  metals. In all his experiments there were traces of a transportation  of the metal from one pole to the other ; now since lead, for example,  is less tenacious than copper, more lead will be carried off than copper  with the same tension of the electricity ; the conducting circuit then  will have its capacity for conduction suddenly increased, and the light  must become more brilliant in consequence.  25 s   386 RECENT PROGEESS IN PHYSICS.  This opinion is sustained by the fact that the intensity of the spark  is very considerably increased if polished brass balls be exchanged for  such as have their surface amalgamated, where evidently the trans-  ference is greatly facilitated.  The spark, with the carbon used for Bunsen's battery, is very white  in the middle, reddish at the edges, and looks a little like a flame.  Â§ 94. Nature of electrical light. â€” There are two hypotheses as to the  nature of the electrical spark ; the first regards it as a motion which  is communicated to the ether by the electrical spark ; according to the  second hypothesis, electrical light is produced by incandescent pon-  derable matter transported by the electricity.  Masson inclines to the first hypothesis, with which also his experi-  ments coincide, since the intensity of the spark depends in no respect  upon the fusibility or oxidibility of the balls, but upon their tenacity.  If, in consequence of the lower tenacity of the metals, more particles  are carried off, the facility of the circuit for conduction is increased ;  hence the same quantity of electricity is discharged in a shorter time,  whereby a more brilliant light is produced. All of the laws of the  brightness of electrical light just mentioned are comprised by the  following formula :  J=:Hf4 (1)  in which  J denotes the intensity of the spark ;  X the striking distance ;  s the surface of the condenser ;  Y the distance of the spark from the rotating disk of the photometer ;  e the thickness of the condenser, and H a constant factor depending  upon elements which are not yet determined.  q  Substituting in equation (1), X=^-^, which is allowable, smce  s  Kiess has shown that the striking distance is proportional to the elec-  trical density (Â§ 31), we have  J=.%.4^ (2)   Y   6'   HÂ»2  by making = w, that is, equal to a constant factor which is ad-  missible so long as the thickness e of the condenser does not vary.  q 2  Hence the intensity of the electrical light is proportional to -V- the  square of the electrical density, or which is the same, to the tension  of the electricity and the surface s of the condenser.  Equation (1) may also be written  J=Y^X5X  Substituting for the last X its value ^â€” , we get  J=I^Xg. ' (3)   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 387  or in words, tlie intensity of the spark is proportional to the striking  distance and quantity of electricity.  According to equation (2),  J = P-li.  s  But Riess has shown that,  w = Qii,  s  is the quantity of heat which is set free in the wire by discharging  through it a quantity of electricity q, collected od the surface s.  Hence if the discharge stroke of an electrical bati.ery produces a spark  at any interruption of the circuity the intensity of the light is propor-  tional to the heat tvhich the same discharge produces in a piece of wire  forming part of the circuit.  At the conclusion of his memoir, Masson proposes the spark gen-  erated under determinate conditions as the photometric unit, by  which it will be possible to compare the intensity of the most diverse  constant sources of light with a common standard.   SECTION FIFTH.  ELECTRICAL ODOR.   Â§ 95. Ozone and its reactions. â€” When we are in the neighborhood of  a powerful electrical machine we perceive, when the electricity issues  from points, or when a series of sparks are passed from the conductor,  a very peculiar odor, which, for sake of brevity, we will term electrical  odor, or osone odor. This electrical odor is very probably that which  is observed after a stroke of lightning ; and which, by those who do  not know how to characterize it properly, is termed a sulphurous smell.  Schonbein observed in the vicinity of a place where lightning had  struck a decided odor of ozone, even some time after the stroke.  Until recently we were quite in the dark as to the nature of this  odor. Some physicists supposed that it was owing to a peculiar affec-  tion of the organs of smell, produced by electricity ; an explanation  which, in addition to its error, did great injury, by preventing further  investigation and discusf3ion.  Others advanced the hypothesis that electrical odor was owing to  fine metallic particles carried off by the escaping electricity. But this  view also is entirely inadmissible, because the nature of the emitting  points does not in the least change the nature of the odor.   388 EECENT PEOGEESS IN PHYSICS.  SchonLein has the great credit of having restored this question to  the current of scientific activity. He has shown that the electrical odor  comes from a peculiar gas, produced during the electrical emission,  which he calls ozone. He has investigated the properties of this sub-  stance for years with the greatest zeal, and although, as yet, it has  not been obtained in an isolated state, many of its important chemical  and physical relations have been ascertained, and further researches  on the subject promise most interesting discoveries in the field of  chemistry.  The first memoir of Schonbein on ozone is in the ^^ De.nkscliriften  der Mundieuer Akademie.\" It is also printed in Poggepdorf's Anna-  Itn. Bd. L. p. 616.  A small pamphlet with the title, \" On the pi^oduction of ozone in the  chemical ivay,\" evidently by Schonbein, was published in 1844 by  Schonbein & Schweighaiiser, in Basel.  The most important treatises on this subject which then followed  are to be found in Poggendorfs Annalen, by reference to the index of  names, appended to the LXXV volume.  In these papers the historical course of Schonbein's discoveries may  be followed out. I will omit this historical investigation on account  of its great extent, and I will not refer to the contents of the separate  paj)ers, but describe the most essential experiments which show the  nature and most important relations of ozone, in the order in which  Professor Schonbein had the goodness to show them to me in the year  1849, and, passing over their earlier phases, present his views upon  its nature as now held, after many years investigation.  The prime conductor of an electrical machine being provided at the  Fig. 82. end with a round-pointed wire, a, b, about 1 line in  diameter, (fig. 82.) When the machine is turned the  peculiar electrical odor will be perceived in the vicinity  of the end a of the wire.  That this odor is not to be ascribed to a mere subjec-  tive affection of the organ rf smell, but is owing to a  peculiar gas, is certain from the fact that this odorous  principle produces a series of chemical and physical  effects, having the greatest similarity to the chemical  reactions and physical relations of other gases. Indeed,  Schonbein has succeeded in preparing this odorous prin-  ciple, ozone, in a purely chemical way, and in producing  the same reactions with it which are observed when elec-  tricity is issuing from points.  If we hold before the point, at the distance of about ^ or 1 inch, a  piece of paper covered with a paste of starch and iodide of potassium,  the paste will at once turn blue.  To make this preparation two teaspoons full of starch with a small  crystal of iodide of potassium are to be boiled to a paste, with ten  times their volume of water.  The ozone acts upon this paste as chlorine does ; it decomposes the  iodide of potassium, and the iodine set free, colors the starch blue.    RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 38d  This phenomenon (of turning the paste of iodide of potassium bine)  takes place in the same manner whether the point emit positive or  negative electricity ; it is also perfectly immaterial of what substance  the point is made, if only an emission of electricity occurs, thus re-  futing the view of those earlier physicists who maintained that the  od5r was owing to metallic particles carried off by the issuing elec-  tricity.  On holding a platinum or gold plate before the point while the  machine is turned, the plate has imparted to it negative galvanic po-  larization, which can be demonstrated in the following manner :  Connect the two mercury cups a and 6, Fig. 83, with the wire ends  of a multiplier. Into the cu[) a dip a copper pj^ gg  wire, to the other end of which a platinum  plate p is fastened, the plate having been  first soldered with gold to a platinum wire,  and this to the copper wire at n. This pla-  tinum plate hangs in a glass vessel contain-  ing water slightly acidified.  After having exposed a perfectly similar  platinum plate for a time to the electricity  issuing from a point, immerse it also in the  water of the glass vessel, and as soon as the  copper wire of the second plate is immersed  into the cup of mercury 6, a considerable  divergence of the galvanometer needle takes place, and in a direction  which indicates that the platinum plate which had been exposed to  ozone behaves negatively toward the other ; that is, the deflection is  in the same direction which would have been indicated had a zinc wire  been placed in a, a copper wire in 6, and these wires then immersed  in the liquid of the glass vessel. This current, however, is only  transient.  The vdiole subject of galvanic polarization we will discuss in an-  other place ;* it is only mentioned here as one of the effects which  accompany the emission of electricity from points.  All these reactions disappear when sulphuretted hydrogen, ammo-  nia, olefiant gas, &c., are diffused in the air of the room where the  experiment is made.  If the emitting point be raised by the flame of a sph'it lamp to a  red heat, and the machine put in operation immediately after the  removal of the lamp, all the above described phenomena, which had  accompanied the escape of electricity, disappear ; that is, the elec-  trical cdor is no longer perceived, the iodine preparation does not turn  blue, platinum or gold plates are not polarized. All the phenomena  reappear, however, gradually, as the point cools.  In order to make the experiment distinct, with reference to the odor,  it must be made with wires of one of the precious metals, because the  easily oxidable metals diffuse a peculiar smell simply by being heated.  Very thin wires are not suitable for this experiment ; but as thick  * See report for 1855, p. 377.   390 RECENT PEOGEESS IN PHYSICS.  ones may not always he at hand, it will do to use a thin platinum  wire having its end fused into a small knob about one line in diameter.  Â§ 96. Electrical odor in the electrolysis of ivater. â€” The electrical  odor appears not only on the escape of electricity from points, but  also in the electrolytic decomposition of water, where we find it ac-  companied by the same reaction and effects which were considered''in  the preceding paragraph.  On closer investigation it appears that electrical odor manifests  itself at the positive pole, where oxygen is given off; for on collecting  the gases resulting from the decomposition of water separately, the  odor in question was perceived only in that vessel which contained the  oxygen, no trace of it being found in the one containing the hydrogen.  The gases when obtained together have the electrical odor.  On suspending a paper covered with the paste of iodide of potas-  sium in oxygen, or in the mixed gases to which the ozone odor has  been imparted by electrolysis, the paper turns blue. A platinum  plate exposed for a time to the action of this, gas indicates the same  electro-negative polarization as though it had been acted on by the  electrical brush.  Chemically pure oxygen gas produces none of these effects ; it has  not the odor, does not turn the iodide paste blue, and is not in the  condition to polarize a platinum plate negatively.  The gas obtained by electrolytic decomposition produces, in all  these cases, the same effects as the air which issues from a strongly  electrified point.  Â§ 97. Fi'oduction of ozone in tJie chemical ivay. â€” The so-called electri-  cal odor can be produced by purely chemical means without any aid  from electricity. A piece of phosphorus made perfectly dry by blotting  paper, so that it has a clean surface, emits a peculiar alliaceous odor.  Placing such a piece of phosphorus in a jar of air, the vapor of phos-  phorus will in the cold soon diffuse itself through the whole jar. A  platinum plate being then suspended in the jar a short time it will  be polarized positively.  The polarization of the platinum plate is to be ascribed to the phos-  phoric vapor diffused in the jar, but the odor very probably is due to  the phosphoric acid, which is formed by the partial oxidation of the  phosphorus vapor.  If a little water be now introduced into the jar, (as much as will  half cover the piece of phosphorus,) the phosphoric odor becomes  weaker and weaker, and at length wholly disappears, and in its place  a decided ozone odor will be perceived. At rather high temperatures  the ozone smell appears very soon.  This odor is not to be distinguished from that produced in the  electrical way, and it is accompanied by all the reactions and effects  which characterize the agency of the electrical odor. A paper with the  iodide paste on it becomes blue when suspended in the jar, and a  platinum plate exposed to its action is polarized electro-negatively .  With the ozone obtained in the chemical way the reactions can be  ])roduced almost exactly in the same form as with a point emitting  electricity. For this purpose a bottle of the capacity of several quarts   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   391   Fig. 84.   is filled with air containing ozone, and closed witli a cork, (Fig. 84.)  having two holes bored in it. Through one  of the holes a tube passes nearly to the  I bottom, having a funnel at its upper end ;  through the other hole a tube passes, which  , merely goes through the cork, and above  ; the cork is bent horizontally, ending in a  . tolerably fine opening ; water being poured  , through the funnel in a regulated stream,  the air containing the ozone is driven out  through the point of the other tube. This  point now behaves exactly like a metallic  point from which an electrical brush issues.  By holding the nose to it the electrical odor  will be observed ; the iodide paper held  before it turns hlue^ and a platinum plate  exposed to the jet is polarized electro-nega-  iivehj.  We have seen above that all the effects of  ozone disappear when the point emitting the  brush is heated, in like manner all the re-  actions of ozone disappear as soon as the horizontal part of the escape  tube is strongly heated by a s{)irit lamp. The air which escapes from  the opening of the hot tube has no longer any smell, it will not turn  the iodide paper blue, nor polarize the platinum plate. But all these  effects reappear on the cooling of the tube.  Â§ 98. Chemical naiure of ozone. â€” Schonbein, the discoverer of ozone,  has observed and investigated for years, with unwearied industry, the  relations of this remarkable substance, and has found that it bears the  greatest resemblance to the hyper oxides ; he has finally come to  the opinion that ozone is nothing else than a gaseous peroxide of  hydrogen. *^  Ozone is therefore formed by a further oxidation of the vapor of  Avater contained in the air. Thus it is explained why water, or rather  the vapor of water, is absolutely necessary to the formation of ozone.  In perfectly dry air ozone cannot be obtained by means of phosphorus.  Electricity prepares the vapor of the atmosphere to oxidize further    â– -' At the present time, however, the view of nearly all of the chemists who have studied  this subject is different from that given by the author. It is now generally conceded that  ozone is nothing but oxygen, but there are two different viÂ»^ws in regard to its nature ;  according to one, ozr.ne is simply oxygen thrown into a condition of activity by the instru-  mentality of electricity or other agents above named.  The other view considers ozone as formed of two or more equivalents of oxygen. If, as  some hold, gaseous oxygen be o^, it could be easily shown that this double molecule under-  going decomposition, (even by reducing agents as phosphorus, the e.ssential oils, &c.,) sets  free Oj^, (oxygen in the nascent state.) which might unite with o^ to form 03, similar in  properties to S o^, (sulphurous acid,) sulphur and oxygen being elements capable of re-  placing each other to form analogous compounds as in the sulphurets and oxide.s.  We deem it moreover quite possibL', in a measure, to reconcile the views of Schonbein  with those last named, but this whole subject, being a purely chemical question, would be  out of place in a report upon physical science, and has only been mentioned because the  bare statement in the text might lead those not familiar with the matter into erroneous  views. G. C. S.   392 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  and form ozone; in like manner phosphorus effects the comhination of  the vapor of water with oxygen, hut, as yet, we are not able to tell  liow it is done.  Ozone is decomposed into its components, oxygen and hydrogen, hy  heat, as shown by the experiment noticed above.  De la Eive and Berzelius, indeed, regarded ozone as modified  oxygen, and maintained that it could be produced by an electrical jet  in dry oxygen, but this is contrary to all Schonbein's analogies.  Schonbein presented the following experiment as the most striking  proof of the presence of hydrogen in ozone : if air containing ozone  be dried as perfectly as possible and then heated, it yields water on  cooling to hydroscopic bodies over which it is passed. The ozone is  decomposed by heat, and the vapor of water which it contained is set  free.  Ozone is one of the most powerful means of producing oxidation  which is known. Air containing ozone being passed for a long time  over finely divided metallic silver, the latter is converted into peroxide  of silver. The vapor of phosphorus is rapidly oxidized under the in-  fluence of ozone, and converted into phosphorous acid .'ind phosphoric  acid.  The fact that the passage of the electrical spark through moist atmo-  spheric air forms nitric acid was discovered by Cavendish, in the year  1785. Schonbein has proved that under like circumstances ozone also  is always formed.  Since ozone can be produced in moist oxygen by the help of the elec-  tric spark, it is evident that the formation of ozone is independent of  that of nitric acid. On the contrary, Schonbein has made it appear  highly probable that the formation of nitric acid is not a direct effect  of electricity, but a secondary effect produced by the oxidizing  influence of ozone on the nitrogen of the atmosphere.  The formation of nitric acid by electricity may be shown in the  simplest manner, by exposing, for a time, a paper moistened with a  solution of carbonate of potash to a jet of electricity escaping from a  wire ; the carbonate, under these circumstances, is converted in part  into nitrate of potash.  The ozone formed by means of phosphorus also produces nitric acid.  The mixture of phosphorous and phosphoric acids, which furms in a  receiver containing a piece of phosphorus, water, and atmospheric air,  is absorbed by water. If this water be colored by a solution of indigo,  the color of the latter is immediately destroyed, an effect which neither  phosphorous nor phosphoric acid alone can produce. The decoloring  is effected by a small quantity of nitric acid, which, formed under the  influence of the ozone, is also dissolved in the water.  That it is actually nitric acid which is here in question is proved by  shaking the water with milk of lime ; insoluble salts of lime are  formed with the phosphorous and phosphoric acids, while a nitrate of  lime remains in solution.  Davy observed that traces of nitric acid appeared at the positive pole  of a pile when a voltaic current passed through water containing air or  nitrogen. Here, also, the formation of nitric acid is a secondary effect   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 393  of electricity. Ozone is first formed by the action of the current, and  the ozone then oxidizes the nitrogen.  ' Â§ 99. Illumination of phosphorus produced by ozone. â€” It is well known  that at low tem[)eratures, slow combustion of phosphorus does not take  place in air free from ozone, and tnere is therefore no illumination in  the dark; this, however, appears as soon as ozone is brought into con-  tact with the phosphorus. In a receiver containing ozonized air  'phosphorus shines at a very low temperature.  Schonbein has shown this very beautifully by presenting a stick of  phosphorus, at a low temperature, to an electrical brush, which, in  accordance with the above, determines the formation of ozone. The  manner in which the experiment was made is as follows : (Pog. Ann.,  Ixviii, 38.)  A piece of phosphorus an inch long, having a clear surface, was  placed on a board in conducting connexion with the earth, and the  freeend of a wire, connected with the conductorof an electrical machine,  brought within a few lines of the pliosphorus. At a temperature of  â€” 2Â° the phosphorus by itself did not shine in the dark; but when the  machine was put in motion, so that an electrical brush played against  the piece of phosphorus, a light flame at once issued from its whole  length, and, like the tail of a comet, extended far beyond the piece of  phosphorus. If the machine be stopped the illumination of the phos-  phorus ceases in a few seconds.  Schonbein obtained a very beautiful illumination by the following  arrangement : A copper wire was coiled around a stick of phosphorus  an inch long, so that the end of the wire extended about a line beyond  the phosphorus, as shown in fig. 85. The ^'=' ^^'  other end of the wire is connected with the  conductor of an electrical machine. At a  temperature below UÂ° the phosphorus did  not shine at all in the greatest darkness ;  but in turning the electrical machine, so that a strong brush appeared  at the end of ihe coil, a luminous cone protruded from the middle of  the brush, which attained a length varying from a i'ew inches to some  feet, according to circumstances. The longest cone obtained by Schon-  bein was 2| feet. With powerful machines such cones should be  obtained of still greater length.  It may be assumed without hesitation that this luminous train is  nothing else than the vapor of phosphorus in slow combustion.  The luminous train vanishes with the electrical brush.   GALVANISM.  [Continued from page 423 of the Report ol 1855.]  SECTION FOURTH.  GALVANIC PHENOMENA OF LIGHT AND HEAT.  Â§ 54. Production of heat hy the galvanic current â€” The laws of the;  development of heat produced by the galvanic current in metallic^  wires, have been investigfated bv Joule, (Phil. Magazine, Oct., 1841,)  and by Lenz, (P. A. LIX, pp. 203 & 407, LXI, p. 18.)  The memoir of Joule not being within my reach, I shall only report i  on the researches of Lenz, and this will be sufficient, since the results  of the Russian and of the English physicist agreee.  The first two sections of the memoir of Lenz, in vol. LIX of Pog. .  Ann., contain only introductory matter, to which we shall but briefly v;  refer.  To measure the strength of the current Lenz made use of a Nerv-  ander's tangent compass, which was most carefully constructed and  tested. He found by accurate experiments that up to 40Â° the strengths  of the currents are proportional to the tangents of the angles of de-  flection.  Lenz also compared his tangent compass with the decomposition of  water. It results, from his numerous and accurate experiments, that i  the tangent of the observed angle of deflection is to be multiplied by '  39.3 in order to obtain the reduced quantity of detonating gas from i  the same current per minute, expressed in cubic-centimetres. Lenz '.  takes for his unit a current which causes a deflection in his tangent t  compass of 1Â°, and this produces 0.686 c, c. of the mixed gases in at  minute. Since our unit of current is that which gives 1 c. c. per '  minute, it is evident that Lenz's values of strength of current must ;  be multiplied by 0.686 to reduce them to our unit. In what follows i  I shall always make use of the reduced values for the strength of cur- â€¢  rent, instead of those of Lenz.  As the unit of resistance Lenz takes the resistance of one wind of '  his rheostat (agometre) of Grerman silver, which, according to his  statement, is equal to the resistance of a copper wire of 6.358 English  feet in length, and 0.0336 English inch in diameter. Hence, it appears  that this unit of resistance is equal to 2.66 of our own ; the values of  Lenz muÂ«t therefore be multiplied by 2.66 to reduce them to our  unit.    RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 395  To measure the heat produced hy the galvanic current in a metallic  ire, Lenz used the apparatus represented in Fig. 47.  In the middle of the board is fastened the ^'s- '^^*  lass stopper B, ground to fit into the neck  fa glass jar which, by means of some grease,  aay be fitted upon it air and water-tight.  ^ brass clamp, omitted in the figure, presses  he lower rim of the neck of the jar to the  )oard, so that it cannot be displaced even by  dolent motions of the apparatus. The jar  las ground in its bottom a cylindrical hole,  nto which the fluid can be poured, and  'lihrough which, also, a thermometer can be  inserted by means of a cork. The thermom-  eter used was divided to 4^ of a degree. Two  pieces of wire of about 1 line in diameter are  passed through perforations in the glass stopper and ceuiented there.  'Their upper extremities projecting into the jar are somewhat conical,  and made of platinum ; these platinum cones are soldered to copper  wires of equal diameter, which, let into the board, pass to the screw-  clamps s, into which the conducting wires from the poles of the battery  are screwed. The wire to be heated is previously coiled into a spiral  around a cylinder of 1 â€” 2 lines in diameter, and has its ends clamped  upon the cones by means of two little pieces of platinum. It remains  erect by its own elasticity, its coils not touching anywhere.  The fluid with which the jar was filled, so far at least as en-  ' tirely to cover the wire-spiral, was spirit of wine containing 85 to 86  ' per cent, of alcohol, for water is so good a conductor that a part of the  current would pass through it and not through the wire, as becomes  immediately apparent from the feeble evolution of gas.  After the wire-spiral was properly fastened and a measured quantity  of spirit of wine poured into the jar the apparatus, together with the  multiplier (Nervander's tangent compass) and the rheostat, were  inserted in the circuit of a Daniell's battery. By means of the rheo-  stat the current was always kept at a constant strength ; and then the  time required to raise the thermometer in the spirit of wine a certain  number of degrees was noted. By turning round the apparatus in a  small circle, the fluid was made to rotate, whereby an equal distribu-  tion of the temperature throughout its mass was produced.  In order to avoid the errors arising from the loss of heat to sur-  rounding bodies, the spirit of wine was previously cooled below the  temperature of the air, and the experiment finished when its tempera-  ture was just as many degrees above that of the surrounding air as it  had been below it at the commencement.  To give a clear idea of the course of the investigation, the individual  steps for one series of experiments will be described at length.  The temperature of the air being 16Â° R, the spirit of wine was  cooled by means of ice down to 7Â° and poured into the jar ; the circuit  was closed and the needle by means of the rheostat constantly kept at  35Â° ; next, with a watch marking seconds, the exact instant was ob-  served when the temperature of the spirit was 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and   396   EECElfT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   15 degrees, and also the instant when it was 16, 17, 18, &c., to 2  degrees, in this way it was found that the time required to raise th  temperature of the spirit of wine from â€”  15 to 17 viz: 2'   was   14 '   ' 18    4   13 '   ' 19    6   12 '   ' 20    8   11 '   ' 21    10   10 '   ' 22    12   1.05 minutes.  2.22  3.25  4.30  5.42  6.53  and hence it follows that the time t, necessary to raise the tempera-i  lure of the spirit of wine 1Â°, was on an average 0.542 minutes.  The resistance to conduction of the spiral wire was ascertained byl  observing, (after the removal of the apparatus of fig. 47 from thel  circuit,) how many turns of the rheostat had to be inserted, in order,  to bring the current again to the same strength that it had with thel  heating apparatus in the circuit.  The following table contains the results of a great number of such'  experiments:   <<- .  O _to  o C   Kind of wire.   s.   t.   I.   1.

How the value  of t was determined each time from a series of experiments has already  been stated above.  The quantity of spirit of wine poured into the jar was always nearly  the same, or 90 grammes on an average.  If we compare all those series of experiments in which the force of   RECENT PROGSESS IN PHYSICS. 397  le current was the same, it appears that the product of t and I re-  lains pretty nearly constant.

Copper tl = 11.60  The equality of the values o^ t I for one and the same current is so  apparent that we may safely assume that the time of heating is in-  versely proportional to the resistance to conduction, or in other words,  that the heat produced in a given time is directly proportional to the  resistance to conduction, and independent upon other properties of the  metaU  In order to find out how the production of heat depends on the force  'of the current, we must compare the experiments that were made with  the same wire, and with different currents ; from these it appears that  the value of s'-t is nearly constant for the same wire. The results are  as follows :  For the German silver wire a :  1 sH= 64.8  2 sH=z 63.3  3 sH = 61.3  For the German silver wire b:  4 s-t= 102.0  5 s-t= 98.4  6 sH= 96.7  7 sH= 93.5  For the platinum wire:  9 sH = 113.5  10 s-t=: 109.1  For the copper v/ire :  12 sH= 436.6  13 5-^ = 429.9  14 sH= 435.5  15 sH = 414.2  16 sH = 412,0  By these experiments, therefore, it is demonstrated that:  1. The production of heat is proportional to the resistance cf the wires  to conduction.   398 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  2. The production of heat is proportional to the squares of the fow\\  of the currents.  If, therefore, t denotes the time wliich is required for the currenti  with the resistance to conduction I, to raise the temperature of a give!  quantity of spirit of wine 1Â° R, then s'-tl will be the time necessary t  produce the same amount of heat in the same quantity of spirit^ l  the unit of the strength of current with the unit of resistance to coi>\"^  duction. Since now in all the experiments the quantity of spirit <  wine was nearly the same, the product s-tl must also be nearly th  same for all of the series in the above table. The product s'^t I hei  the following values for the diiferent series of experiments :  Series. s-tl.  1 6059  2 5927  3 5758  4 5994  5 5770  6 5706  7 5625  8 5747  9 5726  10 5609  11 5975  12 6069  13 5976  14 6062  15 5803  16 5896  Mean 5856  The quantity of spirit heated in these experiments together witlt'  that of the glass, reduced by the relation of the specific heats to spirit!  was 118 grammes.  The unit of the force of current produces, therefore, when passing;  through a wire which offers the unit of resistance to conduction, an  much heat as would be required to raise the temperature of \\\\l\\  grammes of spirit of wine 1Â° R. in 5856 minutes.  The specific heat of the spirit used in the above experiments is 0.7  to raise, therefore, the temperature of 118 grammes of spirit to a given  degree requires the same quantity of heat as to raise 118.07 \"=â–  82. (t  grammes of water to the same degree. For 1 gramme of waterf  therefore, that time amounts to :  5856  Q^-jT = 70.9 minutes;  or if instead of Reaumer's scale that of Celsius is employed, 70,9 . 0,8  â– =. 56.72 minutes,* i. e., when the unit of the force of current passes  through a wire, the resistance of which is equal to that of a coppei i  wire of 1 meter in length and l\"\"\"\" in diameter, the quantity of heat  produced is such as would raise the temperature of 1 gramme of watei  1Â° C. in 56f minutes.  * In^he memoir of Lenz, an error occurs in this calculation, (P\"C[. Ann., LXl, 42,) occaÂ«  sioned probably by mistaking minutes for seconds.   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 359  If we take for the unit of heat, as is usually done, that quantity  which raises the temperature of one kilogramme of water 1Â°, then it  follows from the above investigations that the unit of the force of cur-  irent_, in passing through the unit of resistance produces in it 0.001057  units of heat in one hour and 0.0000176 in one minute.  i' Â§ 55, Observations on the results obtained by Lenz. â€” After Lenz had  \"determined the relation between the force of current and the production  of heat in a metallic circuit, the idea naturally occurs that we might  'compare the heat produced in the circuit wire with the quantity of  ^detonating gas produced by decomposition of water in the exciting  cells, but a more intimate study of the subject soon proves that such a  comparison cannot lead to a constant result.  If there be a fixed relation between the quantity of detonating gas  and the production of heat for any given arrangement of the Voltaic  battery and a given closing wire, it will be changed as soon as â€” ceteris  paribus â€” either the specific resistance to conduction of the battery or  its electromotive force is changed ; for by either of these changes the  strength of current is altered, and the evolution of gas changes pro-  portionally with the force of current, while the production of heat  increases as the squares of this force; and the relation between the  quantity of gas and the heat developed must necessarily become dif-  ferent from what it was before. The heat produced in the closing  circuit, therefore, can by no means be considered as a thermal equiva-  lent of the detonating gas evolved in the exciting cells, and con-  sequently there can be no definite relation between the heat produced  by exploding a certain quantity of detonating gas, and that set free in  the closing circuit during the evolution of an equal quantity of gas  in the exciting cells of a galvanic battery.  The attempt to compare, even with only approximate correctness,  the quantity of electricity of the electrical machine with that of Volta's  apparatus, has always, hitherto, been unsuccessful. After Lenz's  accurate researches on the production of heat by the galvanic current,  and Riess' reliable quantitative determinations of the heat set free in  a wire by the passage of the discharge of a Leyden jar, at first sight  it would seem that a basis was found for this comparison. But here  too the result on examination is a negative one.  From the rather large quantity of heat produced in metallic wires  by the discharge of the jar, we should be disposed to infer that a rather  large quantity of electricity was brought into action thereby ; according  to the experiments before mentioned* the increase of heat in the pla-  tinum wire of the air thermometer for -^ = 1 is equal to 0.3787, or  in round numbers equal to 0.4. That wire had a diameter of 0.072'\"  and a length of 59.7'\" and therefore it weighed about 60 milligrammes ;  to raise the temperature of this wire 0.4Â° requires, as can easily be  computed, 0.000000768 units of heat.  Let us now consider what quantity of heat would have been set free  in the same platinum wire by the unit of galvanic current. In the  * See Report of 1856, p. 437.   400 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  unit of resistance, the unit of current produces 0.0000176 units of heat  per minute ; but the resistance to conduction of such a platinum wire  as can easily be calculated, is equal to 6 and consequently by the unit  of current, 0.0000176 X 6 =r 0.0001 units of heat would have been  produced in it. The increase of temperature in the platinum wire  from the discharge of the jar for -^- = 1, viz: 0.000000768 is there-  o  fore nearly yj,^ of that produced by the unit of force of the current  durino; one minute in the same wire. When 5=1, i. e. when the  electricity is accumulated in one of the jars (mentioned in the experi-  ment above quoted,) q must also be equal to 1 . For s = 1 and q = 10,  i. e. when the jar is charged with 10 sparks from the measuring jar  under the circumstances formerly explained, then its discharge must  produce in a metallic wire an increase of heat nearly equal to that  produced by the unit of current during one minute in the same wire.  But to charge the jar with q = 10, the machine will scarcely require  to be turned for one minute, and therefore the inference might be  drawn from a superficial investigation of the production of heat, that .  turning the machine for one minute would produce a quantity of elec-  tricity equal to the chemical unit of the galvanic current.  But that such a comparison, or rather such a conclusion from the  comparison can not at all be admitted, is evident from the fact, that  by means of the electrical machine no perceptible decomposition of  water can be obtained, while one cubic centimetre of detonating gas  ought to be readily evolved per minute.  But a more careful investigation soon shows that the discharge of  the jar and the galvanic current act under entirely different and not i  comparable conditions, in producing heat in the Avire.  The same charge of the jar when passing more slowly through a  wire produces less heat in it, and the increase of temperature becomes  imperceptible as soon as the time of discharge reaches a measurable  duration ; if, therefore, the quantity of electricity, obtained by turning  the machine for one minute, when accumulated in the jar produces by  its discharge perceptible heat, the same quantity of electricity dis-  charged through the wire in a continuous current during one minute, ,  will not perceptibly raise the temperature of the wire. But only such i  a current can be compared with the galvanic. In order to compare e  the electricity of the machine with that of the battery in relation to )  quantity, we should be able to measure the quantity of heat which is -  produced in a metallic wire by the electricity passing through it from  the conductor of the machine. The instantaneous discharge of an  accumulated quantity of electricity cannot directly be compared with  a continuous current. That the process by which heat is evolved in  the discharge of the Leyden jar is entirely different from that of the .''  galvanic current, is also evident from the fact, that with the former i  not only the quantity of electricity discharged through them is con-  cerned, but also the area of surface upon which it was previously  distributed ; thus, in the production of heat by the discharge of the  jar, factors come into question which with the current do not appear  at all. The galvanic current and the discharge of the jar have, as far  as regards the production of heat in metallic wires only this in com-   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   401   mon, that the rise of temperature is proportional to the square of the  ;pantity of electricity and to the resistance of the conductino; wire.  Â§56. Ignition of metallic loires hy the galvanic current. â€” While the  phenomena of the ignition of metallic wires by means of the discharge  of the Leyden jar have been elucidated by the ingenious researches of  Riess, corresponding investigations are wanting in reference to the  galvanic current, though the latter might probably ofier less diffi-  culties than the former.  In Casselmann's treatise (already mentioned) \" On the galvanic  carbon- zinc battery, Marburg, 1844,\" the following remark occurs on  page 43 :  \"A platinum wire of considerable length used for closing the  circuit, does not become red hot, but when shortened to a certain  length it does. Lessening this, however, by shortening it more and  more it reaches finally a length at which it does not become red hot  any more, and from this it follows that the ignition of the closing  wire reaches a maximum only when its resistance to conduction bears  a certain proportion to the quantity of electricity forcing its way  through it.\"  If the current of a battery makes a wire red hot by passing through  it, still the force of this current must increase by shortening the wire,  and it therefore appears not quite probable that the stronger current  should no longer heat the shorter piece of wire to redness. To throw-  some light on this point, I made a series of experiments myself, since,  as above remarked, no thorough investigations have been made on this  law of ignition in the galvanic current.  My experiments were made in the following manner: In the circuit  of the battery S (fig. 48) there was inserted at H, a wire-holder,  which will next be described, and at i>, a tangent comnass. At Q  there was a little mercury cup, by means of which the circuit could  readily be opened and closed.  The wire-holder is represented in fig. 49. Upon a board two brass  rods were fastened, on each of which were two screw clami>,s capable  of sliding up and down.   Fiff. Â«.   Fig. 48.    26 s   402   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   In one of the clamps a, the connecting wire from one pole of the'S  battery was screwed and in the other that leading to the tangent- j  compass. Between the clamps 6, the experimental wires were ex-  tended and this was always done before closing the battery. The con-  necting wires between S, H, B, Q and S, were copper wires about |  line in diameter, and of a total length not exceeding 5 metres, so  that their resistance was not considerable.  After the wire to be experimented upon was properly inserted at E  and all the other connexions properly made, the circuit was closed ati  Q ; and, after the compass needle had come to rest, its deflection was.  observed and at the same time the ax)pearance of the ignition in the!  wire.  The course of the experiments will become evident from the follow-^  ing tables which contain the results of the observations.  The first three sets of experiments were made with platinum w'lrt  of 0.45 millimetres in diameter.  FIRSr SERIES.  Battery of 40 carhon-zinc cups.

These experiments prove that one and the same loire produces, luith  he same strength of current, the same phenomena of ignition, whatever  nay be its length.  In the platinum wire of 0.45 metre in diameter a partial ignition  s produced by a strength of current corresponding to a deflection of  t5Â° to 46Â°. With 40 elements this is effected in a wire of 1.3  netre in length, with 24 cups in one of 0.5 metre, and with 12 cups  n one of 0.4 metre.  The red heat apjiears in all these experiments with a force of cur-  'ent of 48Â°, while in the first series the length of wire is 1 metre, in  ;he second 0.3 metre, and in the third 0.2 metre.  The light red heat occurs with a strength of current of 50 to 51Â°.  Quite similar are the results from the experiments with the iron wire.  Partial ignition ajjpears with a force of current of 82Â° to 33Â°, intense red  heat with 35Â°. These experiments therefore do not show the pecu-  liarity mentioned by Casselmann. It is to be regretted that he gives  no more exact details, from which perhaps the reason of the anomaly  observed by him could be explained. I presume, liowever, that it is  caused by the great conduction of heat by the mass of the metal in the  wire clamps, which has a considerable influence with very short wires.   404   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   Casselmann used a wire-holder similar to that represented in fig 4 J  By observing attentively a wire held by it while it is red hot, v,  perceive that in the immediate vicinity of the clamps its glow is coi  siderably less than in the middle. If now the wire be so far shorlene  that the cooling influence of the clamps extends to its middle it seem  easy to explain how, by shortening the length of the wire, the ph(i  nomena of ignition finally disappear. This is also seen from th  following observation :  A platinum wire 0.21 metre in diameter was inserted in the circui  of a sinojle carbon-zinc cup. With a length of 3 centimetres it bt  came feebly red hot, while the tangent compass indicated 26Â°; bt  when the same wire was shortened to 1 centimetre no ignition wav  produced, even with a current of 34Â°.  When, instead of the single element, two Bunsen's cups were used?  the appearances of ignition were entirely identical with the length;  of both 3 and 1 centimetre, though the corresponding deflection i  the former case was 34Â°, and in the latter (the shorter wire) 44Â°.

Comparison of the laws of galvanic ignition with those of Lei  for the devel >pment of heat. â€” According to the laws of Lenz, the quai  tity of heat liberated in a metallic wire increases proportionally 1  the square of the force of the current, and to the resistance to coi  duction of the wire. But with equal length the resistance to condun  tion is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter. I  therefore â€” all the other conditions remaining unchanged â€” the fore  of current increases as the diameter of the wire, the quantity of lies  developed must remain the same.  But if in a thicker wire just as much heat is evolved as in a thinm  one, we should certainly expect that the former would not attain tl:  same degree of ignition as the latter, because the thicker wire imparl  more heat to the surrounding air ; therefore, in order to obtain a  equal degree of ignition in a wire of w times the diameter, we shoul  have to employ a current more than n times stronger, while accordin  to the above experiments a current with n times increased force  suflicicnt.  Let us more accurately determine this relation. According to tl  researches of Lenz, above discussed, the heat produced in metall  '\"â–  Melted after a while.   EECENT PEOGRESS IN PHYSICS. 407  Ivires by a galvanic current is proportional to the square of the force  ')f current and to the resistance to conduction of the wire. We can,  herefore, put  W =5^ Z . . , . 1.)  ifhere W denotes the quantity of heat produced (within a given time)  :n a wire, the resistance of which is I for the strength of current s.  We may now consider W the quantity of heat which must be produced  lin a given time in the wire in order to make it red hot. If this  mire be replaced by one of the same metal and of equal length, but n  [times the diameter, its surface will also be n times as great, and this  surface gives to the surrounding air â€” cceteris paribus â€” n times as  'much heat, and therefore n times as much heat, viz: w W, must be  'evolved in the thicker wire in order to produce the same appearance of  [red heat. But the resistance to conductions of the wire of n times  igreater diameter is â€”7. Denoting by &' the strength of current  jwhich makes it red hot, we obtain the equation :  w W = 6'2 -4 . . . .  n-  I therefore, W =- s'^ A 2)  and by combining the equations 1) and 2)  s'- = n^ s^  or s' = s V^-' 3).  Thus, according to this reasoning, a current of 2.83 and 5.19 times  the strength should be necessary in order to make red hot, wires, the  diameter of which is twice or three times as great, while, according  to my observations, a two and three times stronger current proves suf-  ficient ; in short, instead of equation 3), according to my observations,  that of s' = w s holds good. The deviations are far too considerable  to allow of the supposition that they proceed from errors of obser-  vation.  How this difference is to be accounted for I am at present unable to  decide. It is, indeed, conceivable that with thicker wires and an equal  strength of current the outermost stratum reaches so low a tem-  perature that the loss of heat is not greater than from thin wires, but  that towards the interior the temperature increases so rapidly that  the outer colder strata have no perceptible influence upon the appear-  ance of the wire. Small differences, too, are lost by the defective esti-  mation of ignition, and it is therefore to be expected that deviations  from the above law relating to the thickness will be found, when the  diameter is more varied than in these experiments. I intend to con-  tinue the investigation of this subject.  The laws of ignition by the galvanic battery and by the discharge  of the Leyden jar differ entirely. While the strength of current must  be increased in equal, or at least nearly equal proportions to the  diameter, the charge in the Leyden jar has to be augmented in pro-  portion to the fourth power of it, if the degree of ignition is to be   408 KECENT PKOGRESS IN PHYSICS.  kept unchanged. This difference already shows that the galvanic  ignition is essentially of another nature from that produced by the  discharge of the jar.  Â§ 59. Determination of the voltaic combination required to produce  ignition in given metallic tvires. â€” The mean values above obtained for  the quotient indicate the force of current necessary to bring a wire  D  of 1 millimetre in diameter into the corresponding degree of ignition.  Therefore, for a platinum wire 1 millimetre in diameter, to make it  feebly red the force of current required is 165 ; to make it red hot the  force of current required is 172 ; to make it nearly white hot the force  of current required is 220.  For an iron wire 1 millimetre in diameter to make it feebly red the  necessary force of current is 121 ; to make it red hot the necessary force  of current is 135. To make a copper wire 1 millimetre in diameter red  hot a force of current of 433 is required ; for silver this value is 432.  I consider these numerical values only as first approximations.  Denoting by s the force oi current which is required to bring a wire  1 millimetre in diameter to a certain state of ignition, th en s.c? indicates  the force required to produce an equal amount of heat in a wire of the  same metal whose diameter is d.  If once we know the force of current a required to produce a  certain degree of ignition in a piece of wire of given diameter, and also  the resistance to conduction r, which this wire in connexion with the  other part of the closing circuit offers, then it is easily computed  what com- bination of voltaic elements, of a known nature, has to be  employed for the purpose.  Let e denote the electro motive force, iv the specific resistance of one  of the cups employed. These have to be so combined that they form  a battery of n elements, each consisting of m cups placed together.  Now, the values of n and m are to be determined.  The cups must be so combined that the resistance of the battery is  equal to that of the closing wire ; the total resistance, therefore, must  be equal to 2r. We have, therefore,  ne  1 2ra  and n =. â€¢   But the specific resistance of our battery is  n   â–  w â– =. r.  m   Therefore, m = lo ;   and the value for n being substituted,  â„¢ 2ii;a  m =   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 409  If, for instance, a platinum wire of 1.5 metre in length and 0.5  millimetre in diameter is to be heated to redness^ how many Bunsen's  cups, of the electro motive force of 800 and the resistance of 10, must  be used and how are they to be combined?  The resistance to conduction of a copper wire 1 millimetre in diameter  and 1.5 metre in length is 1.5; thatof alike platinum wire is 5.1,5 =:*7, 5.  But the resistance of a wire of one-half the diameter is four times as  great, viz : 30. This would be the resistance at the usual tempera-  ture ; but when the wire is red hot it is at least twice as great, viz :  60. If we suppose that the resistance of the other part of the closing  circuit is comparatively so little that it may be neglected, we have  r = 60, and, for our case, a = 172.0,5 = 86. ThereforCj   nMO  12.9  m   = 86, consequently, n = 12,9  10 = 60, consequently, m = 2,1 ;   from which it follows that a battery of 12 double elements has to be  employed.  It is evident from this example that in the above mentioned exper-  iments the arrangement was not the most advantageous.  If a copper wire 1 millimetre in diameter and 0.5 metre in length is to  be heated to redness, its resistance would be 1, supposing it to be twice  as great at a red heat as it is at the usual temperature. If the resist-  ance of the rest of the closing circuit is also equal to 1, its total will  be equal to 2 ; but a in this case is 433, and therefore  n = 2.16, m = 10.8.  We have, therefore, to use a battery of two elements, each of which  consists of 11 cups.  A more accurate knowledge of the resistance to conduction of metals  at a red heat would be necessary to give a greater degree of exactness  to these calculations.  In general more cups in a series will be required for producing igni-  tion if the wires are bad conductors and of greater length,, and more  cups, side by side in each element, if they are good conductors and of  greater diameter.  Â§ 60. Ignition of metallic wires in different gases. â€” Grove has made the  remarkable observation that platinum wire heated to redness by the  voltaic current in atmospheric air, is apparently extinguished when  covered with a bell-glass, filled with hydrogen. â€” (Phil. Transact.,  1847, pt. 1 ; Fog. Ann., LXXI, 196.) Since the resistance to con-  duction is greater in a wire intensely ignited than in one the heat of  which is less intense, it was to be expected that, cceteris paribus, the  same wire when in hydrogen would conduct a stronger current than in  atmospheric air.  Grove proved the correctness of this conclusion in the following   410   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   manner : In the circuit of a constant battery besides a platinum wire,  which could conveniently be surrounded by an atmosphere of different  gases, a voltameter was inserted. The intensity of ignition in the pla-  tinum wire was found to be very different in the different gases, but, at  the same time^ the rate of the decomposition of water in the voltameter  was also changed, so that in equal times the quantity of detonating  gas obtained was greater as the heat evolved by the wire was less. The  following quantities of detonating gas were obtained per minute in  the voltameter when the platinum was immersed in the gases enume-  ated:  In hydrogen 7.7 cubic inches.  defiant gas 7.0 \"  carbonic oxide 6.6 \"  carbonic acid 6.6 \"  oxygen 6.5 \"  nitrogen.... 6.4 *'  atmospheric air 6.4 \"  do. condensed 6.5 \"  do. rarified 6.3 ''  chlorine 6.1 \"  With the appearance of light in the wire, the heat produced in it  also is greater, as is demonstrated by the following experiment: The  bulb of a thermometer was placed at a certain distance from a coil of  wire, which was heated to redness by a battery of 4 cells. When the  coil remained in atmospheric air the thermometer rose 15Â° in five min-  utes, but when it was immersed in hydrogen the rise, during the same  interval, was only 7.5Â°.  Poggendorf, in a note, expresses the opinion that this phenomenon  may be connected with the observation formerly made by Dulong and  Petit, that a heated body is more rapidly cooled in hydrogen than in  atmospheric air. To me this view seems inadmissible, for if the wire  in hydrogen gives out more rapidly the heat developed in it, the  thermometer ought to rise more rapidly when the wire is placed in  this gas, provided the quantity of heat produced in the wire by the  galvanic current is always the same in whatever gas it is placed.  This experiment, however, is not yet decisive ; but another one,  described by Grove in a later memoir on the same subject, beyond a  doubt refutes the above explanation of Poggendorf. â€” (Phil. Magazine,  XXXY, 114 ; Fog. Ann. LXXVIII, 366.) Two glass tubes, A and  B, fig. 50, 1.5 inch in length  and 0.3 inch interior diame-  ter, were closed at both ends  with corks, which were  penetrated by copper wires,  connected inside of the tube  by a spiral of platinum wire  Jy inch in diameter and 3.7  inches in length. The tube  A was filled with oxygen, B with hydrogen, and the tubes were then  placed in separate vessels, similar in every respect, and containing   Fig. 50.    RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICti. 411  a'bout 3 ounces of water. A thermometer was immersed in the water  of each of the vessels, and the copper wires were so connected that they  formed part of the closing circuit of a constant zinc-platinum battery  of 8 cells, each of 8 square inches acting surface.  When the battery was closed the wire in the oxygen became incan-  descent, while that in the hydrogen was not visibly ignited. The  temperature of the water, which was 60Â° F. in both vessels at the  beginning of the experiment, rose within 5 minutes to 70\" in that  around the hydrogen tube, and to 81Â° in that around the one contain-  ing the oxygen.  When both the tubes were filled with the same kind of gas the  temperature in both vessels rose to the same degree.  This experiment decidedly proves that the appearance of less heat  in the wire immersed in hydrogen, with perfectly identical strength  of current, cannot be caused by a more rapid absorption of heat by  the hydrogen, because then, on the contrary, the water surrounding  the hydrogen tube ought to be heated sooner. All this indicates that,  in fact, a less production of heat takes place in the wire when sur-  rounded by hydrogen.  G-rove has proved that this phenomenon is not caused by a small  amount of conduction of electricity by the hydrogen ; he has also de-  monstrated that it cannot be brought into any connexion with the  other physical properties of the gases, their density, specific heat, &c.  As to the explanation of this peculiar fact, Grove endeavored in  vain to find a tolerable one, and in the course of his somewhat dilated  and obscure discussion arrives himself quite inconceivably at the con-  jecture that the diiference of the gases might have a similar effect to  a difference in the condition of the surfaces. This would essentially  coincide with Poggendorf's above mentioned opinion, which was pro-  pounded, however, before the experiment with the two glass tubes of  fig. 50, which in the most distinct manner refutes such a view, was  known to him. But Grove gives his consent to it immediately after  he has himself made and described the experiment, which proves that  this basis of explanation is inadmissible, and that the phenomenon  cannot be deduced from diff'erences in conduction and radiation of heat.  In my opinion the phenomenon is still entirely isolated and unex-  plained. I do not think it profitable in such cases to cover up our  want of knowledge with dilated disquisition, in which the physical  scape-goat of our days, molecular action, has to play the principal part.  Â§ 61. Effect of ignited platinum ivires on different gases. â€” It is a  known fact that some of the compound gases suff'er decomposition in  red hot tubes. Grove has produced similar effects upon these gases  by the action of ignited platinum wires. â€” (Phil. Trans., 1817, ]it. 1 ;  Pogg. Ann. LXXI, 194.) The following is the apparatus he used for  this purpose :  Into the upper end of an eudiometer tube, fig. 51, a curved plati-  num wire was fused, from whose extremities copper wires conducted to  the two mercury cups which connected them with the poles of the  battery. The gas to be examined was confined over water, and, to  prevent the glass from becoming too much heated, the whole eudiome-   412   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   ter tube was immersed in a wider vessel filled with water. Sometimes  the water was covered with a layer of oil one inch in depth.   Fig. 51.    /0!Sill\"ll'''\"l\"lllllliiW&   ^    /â– ^^^fe   \\    P .ij: ,!   \\    Iflpl   \\   Fig. 52.    When the gases had to he confined over mercury, or when a longer  continuation of the ignition was necessary, the apparatus of fig. 52  was used. He:e the eudiometer tube is bent, and its closed end, con-  taining the platinum wire, immersed in a vessel filled with water or  oil ; the open end dipping into another vessel containing the water or  mercury, used for confining the gases. With this apparatus the  following results were obtained :  Nitric oxide, over distilled water, contracted in varying proportions  to the heat. (The volume, of course, was not measured before the  apparatus had entirely cooled.) In the best experiments the contrac-  tion amounted to one-third of the original volume. The remaining  gas was nitrogen, and nitric acid was found dissolved in the water.  Nitrous oxide was decomposed into nitrogen and oxygen ; the  volume increased by 0.35 of the original. The full equivalent pro-  portion or 0.5 could not be obtained.  Carbonic acid did not show any perceptible change.  Ammonia increased to double its original volume ; the gas could no  longer be absorbed by water, and consisted of 3 vol. of hydrogen and  1 vol. of nitrogen.  Olejiant gas contracted a little, and deposited carbon. The re-  mainder was hydrogen and olefiant gas ; the greater the heat the  more hydrogen was formed.  Nitrogen remained unchanged.  Oxygen contracted but very little, about one-fiftieth of its volume ;  it might, perhaps, have contained a minute quantity of hydrogen.  Chlorine over water gave white fumes, and a grayish-yellow insolu-  ble powder collected on the sides of the tube, near the platinum wire;  this was afterwards found to be chloride of platinum. The greatest  part of the chlorine combined with the hydrogen of the aqueous vapor,  and the muriatic acid formed was absorbed by the water. When the  experiment was finished the volume of gas was reduced to about one-  half, and the remainder was oxygen.  With bromine and iodide of chlorine oxygen was evolved, (how the  experiments with these bodies were performed I could not perfectly   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 413  understand.) The residue could not be examined, because it acted  both upon the platinum and upon the glass  Hydrogen contracted very much, sometimes to one-tenth of the  original volume. The cause of this contraction was a small quantity  of oxygen, with which hydrogen gas is nearly always contaminated.  Phosphorus brought in to the most carefully prepared hydrogen emits  vapors of phcisphorous acid, shines in the dark, and produces a slight  contraction. But even after this, the ignited wire produces a further  contraction. The phosphorus, therefore, cannot remove all the oxygen  from the hydrogen.  After this experience Grove doubts the correctness of the values  ascertained for the atomic weight of hydrogen.  According to these experiments it seems that it would be more  advantageous to use the platinum wire ignited by the galvanic cur-  rent, than the electrical spark in eudiometric experiments.  Hydrogen and carbonic acid mixed in equal volumes were easily  affected by the ignited wire. They contracted to 0,48 of the original  volume ; the residue was carbonic oxide. One equivalent of oxygen  and 1 of hydrogen had, therefore, combined together.  Carbonic oxide exhibited a remarkable phenomenon. Carefully  purified from any carbonic acid, it was exposed to the action of the  ignited wire over distilled water, and its volume increased from one-  fifth to one-third, according to the intensity of ignition.  When the gas was dry and confined over mercury, this increase of  volume did not take place ; it must have been dependent, therefore,  upon the presence of aqueous vapor ; and, in fact, the increase of  volume was found to be caused by the formation of carbonic acid. By  agitation with caustic potash or lime water the gas was reduced to  exactly its former volume ; but then it was found to be mixed with  a volume of hydrogen equal to that of the carbonic acid absorbed.  This is explained in the ioUowing manner : \" Half a volume or one  equivalent of oxygen derived from the vapor of the water had com-  bined with one volume or equivalent of carbonic oxide, and formed  one volume or equivalent of carbonic acid, leaving in place of the car-  bonic oxide, with which it had combined, the one volume or equiva-  lent of hydrogen with which it had been originally associated.\"  On comparing this experiment with the previous one, the singular  inversion of affinity under circumstances so nearly similar will appear  surprising; in the former case hydrogen abstracted oxygen from car-  bonic acid in order to form water, leaving carbonic oxide, while in the  latter the carbonic oxide takes the oxygen trom the aqueous vapor to  form carbonic acid and leaves hydrogen.  A more exact idea of the nature of these reactions has not yet been  obtained. By the latter experiment, in which a decomposition of  aqueous vapor also took place, G-rove was led to the idea that it might  be possible to decompose aqueous vapor and produce detonating gas  simply by means of the ignited wire. He succeeded in this as will be  seen in the following :  Â§ 62. Decomposition of aqueous vapor by ignited platinum luire. â€”  Grove discusses the decomposition of aqueous vapor into its elements  in the same memoir in which he treats of the action of the ignited   414   REGENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.    wire upon the different gases. After many unsuccessful experiments  this decomposition was effected by means of the following apparatus :  A bent glass tube,  Fig- 53- open at one end, (fig.  53) was connected at  its other end by a nar-  row neck, with a bulb  into which the plati-  num wire passed, as  represented in the fig-  ure. The whole tube  was filled with water  previously freed from  air, and its open end  immersed in a vessel of water. On applying a battery of two zinc-plati-  num cells, the air in the bulb was expanded and expelled so that the  water entered it and then soon boiled, and at a certain period the wire  became ignited in the vapor. \"At this instant a tremulous motion  was perceptible, and separate bubbles of the size of pin-heads ascended  and collected in the bend of the tube. It was not a continuous evolu-  tion of gas as in electrolysis, but appeared to be a series of jerks; the  water in returning through the narrow neck formed a natural valve,  which cut off by an intermitting action portions of the atmosphere  surrounding the wire.\" The collected gas was detonating gas.  That this evolution of detonating gas can certainly not be attributed  to electrolysis has been satisfactorily demonstrated by G-rove. I give  below the most important of his arguments.  1. A battery of two cups produces in distilled water, even under  the most favorable conditions, a scarcely perceptible electrolysis.  2. The decomposition did not commence until the wire became  ignited.  3. When the wire was divided no gas was evolved.  Grove now endeavored to produce the decomposition of aqueous  vapor in such a manner that the red hot platinum wire could only  come in contact with the vapor. A glass tube, as in fig. 54, which  at its closed end had a curved platinum  F's- ^'*- wire melted in, was filled with water  which had been carefully freed from air  by long boiling and the air pump; it was  then inverted in a vessel of the same  water, and a spirit lamp applied to its  closed extremity until the upper half was  filled with vapor, which therefore sur-  rounded the platinum wire. The wire  ,â€ž was then brought to full ignition. After  M.W'i^df0&>^' . the connexion was broken and the lamp  removed, the water gradually ascended  again, but a bubble of the size of a mustard seed remained in the  tube, and detonated when touched by a lighted match at the surface  of the water trough. The experiment was repeated, the wire being    EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 415  kept ignited for a longer time, but the gas could not be increased  beyond a very limited quantity.  The experiment just described was repeated and the gas bubble  transferred to another tube, the wire was then again ignited in vapor,  the bubble formed again removed, until a sufficient quantity of gas  was collected for analysis, which required the labor of ten hours.  This gas was now detonated in a eudiometer and left a residue of  0.35 of its original volume, which consisted of nitrogen. The experi-  ment was repeated several times with the same result; sometimes a  trace of oxygen was found in the residue.  Here electrolysis was completely excluded ; the wire was ignited in  dry steam.  When in the apparatus of fig. 55 the  sparks of a large hydro-electric machine ^'Â°\" ^''\"  were passed between platinum points  through the vapor, a small bubble of de-  tonating gas was also formed.  As in the previous experiments a whole  day's work did not increase the bubble,  but when it was transferred, another in-  stantly formed. The gas similarly col-  lected detonated and left a residue of 0.4  of its original volume of nitrogen with a trace of oxygen.  By an estimation, which could of course only be approximate, the  detonating gas formed, was found to be about y^Vo\" ^^ the volume of  the vapor.  Grove considered this evolution of detonating gas not to be a spe-  cific effect of electricity at all, but of heat alone, and indeed, succeeded  also in decomposing aqueous vapor merely by heat without electricity.  Omitting the less successful experiments, we shall at once proceed to  those that gave very decisive results. With a constant battery of 30  zinc-platinum cells the end of a thick platinum wire was melted into  a globule of the size of a pepper corn ; between this and the carbon  point of the negative pole the voltaic arc was taken until the gobule  was again near its melting point. It was then rapidly plunged into  water, freed from air, that was kept boiling by means of a spirit lamp,  and into which a tube filled with the same water was inverted. Sepa-  rate bubbles of gas rose into the tube. This process was repeated  until a sufficient quantity of gas was collected, which, after explosion,  once left a residue of 0.4 ; another time only 0.25 of the original  volume, consisting, as usual, of nitrogen and traces of oxyen. The  galvanic battery here served evidently only to bring the platinum to  ignition. When melted and heated by means of the oxy-hydrogeu  blow-pipe, it acted exactly in the same manner. In this way more than  ^ cubic inch of detonating gas was obtained.  The heated globule is evidently, when immersed in the water,  immediately surrounded by a stratum of vapor, from which then the  small quantity of detonating gas is developed.    416 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  To obtain a continuous evolution of the mixed gases from water sub-  jected to the action of heat alone, Grove constructed the apparatus  Fig. 56. shown in fig. 56 ; a and b  are tubes of silver 4 inches  in length and 0.3 in diam-  eter, connected by two pla-  tinum caps to a tube of a  perforated platinum wire  0.125 inches diameter, the  bore having the diameter of  a large pin ; a is closed at  the extremity, and to the  extremity of b is fitted, by  means of a coiled strip of  bladder, the bent glass tube d. The whole apparatus is filled with  water freed from air, and, after having expelled the air from a by  heat, the end of the glass tube was immersed in a vessel of boiling  water. Heat is now applied by a spirit lamp, first to b and then to a,  until the whole boils ; after this the flame of an oxy-hydrogen blow-  pipe is directed upon the middle part of the platinum tube c, and when  this has obtained a high degree of ignition gas is evolved which, mixed  with vapor, soon fills the whole apparatus, and escapes through the  open end either into the open air or into a gas collector.  The gas thus obtained left, after its detonation, a residue of 0.3 of  its volume, consisting of nitrogen and a trace of oxygen.  That, in all these caries, the remnant consists of nitrogen is caused  by the great difficulty or even impossibility of absolutely removing all  the air from the water.  This series of phenomena is very remarkable. While the detonating  gas, under the influence of heat, is condensed to vapor of water, we  have here exactly the opposite action, though to a very limited extent  only. The elaboration of the more intimate conditions and relations  of this decomposition of aqueous vapor, which might lead to an explan-  ation of the phenomenon, we must leave to the future.  When Grove says \" that these experiments afford some promise of  our being, at no distant period, able to produce mixed gases for pur-  poses of illumination, &c., by simply boiling water and passing it  through highly ignited platinum tubes, or by other methods,\" I cannot  help expressing my doubts whether, even if the manufacture on a  large scale should succeed, the detonating gas thus produced could  give more light and heat than the fuel consumed in its formation.  Â§ 63. Application of galvanic ignition to blasting rocks. â€” It has for a  long time been known that gunpowder can be ignited by the electric  spark, as shown long ago by Franklin, and still repeated a^ one of the  usual experiments in the lecture room. But, although blasting by  means of frictional electricity is therefore possible, still there are too  many difficulties in the way of the process to allow us to expect its  introduction into practice.  Hare was the first to employ the ignition of metallic wires by the  galvanic current in blasting. But his apparatus was too complex and     RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   417   Fi.'. 57.   unsuited for every day use by common laborers, and, therefore never  was used to a great extent.* In consequence of the many fatal  accidents in mines and quarries, Roberts, of England, directed his  attention to this subject. After many endeavors he succeeded in  making the application of the galvanic current to blasting so simple  that his process deserves general commendation. It was first described  in the Mechanics' Magazine, May, 1842, p. 353. â€” (Dingler's Polytech.  Journal, LXXXV, 275.) We shall be .brief in this notice, as pro-  bably much that is contained in the article mentioned is well known.  In order to avoid the necessity of arranging before each charge the  fine iron wire between the conductors, Roberts invented cartridges, a  number of which can always be prepared in advance. They are made  in the following manner : two copper wires, each 10 feet long and 1 line  thick, well covered with waxed cotton or woolen yarn, are placed side  by side close together ; at one end they are twisted together for aborit  6 inches, as represented in Fig, 57, and their extremities left to form  a fork, a little over ^ inch long, with its extremities l,  inch apart ; the ends of this fork are then laid bare,  cleaned by filing, and the fine iron wire is stretched  between them. The iron wire is wound around the  extremities of the copper wires, and may then be soldered  with tin.  The iron igniting wire is, of course, destroyed by each  explosion ; to save the conducting copper wires they  are firmly tied together with twine, as indicated in the  !fio;ure, and then wound around with fine binding wire.  I The body of the cartridge is a tin tube, 3 inches in  [length and f to 1 inch in width, soldered and perfectly  I water tight. (A glass tube might probably answer.)  ' The fine iron or steel wire is placed at aboat the middle of  ; the cylinder, and is kept in its place by means of a cork  I which closes the cylinder, and through which the  I twisted copper wires pass. It is best to cut this cork  â€¢ lengthwise, and after putting the wire between the  two halves, to press them into the tube. But on account  of the thickness of the conducting wires it will probably  be found more convenient to make a groove in the cork  for their reception. The cork being put in so that the  fork is nowhere in contact with the sides of the tube, it  is covered with a good cement. Roberts recommends a  mixture of one part beeswax and two parts rosin.  The tube is then to be filled through its open end  with dry sporting powder, and closed by another cork,  which must also be covered with the cement.  Figure 58 represents the entire cartridge. Figure 59 shows how  the cartridge is pla,ced in the hole;  * Our author could not possibly have seen Dr. Hare's description of his apparatus when  he wrote this sentence. The original notice (Am. Jour. Science and Arts, vol. 21, p. 139,  1832,) shows that Dr. Hare's apparatus was not complex, and that it was essentially the  eame as that here desciibed as the contrivance of Roberts. Gr. C. S.  27 s    418   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   1    The charge is    After all dusfc and moisture are properly removed from it, one half  of the intended charge is put into the hole, the cartridge is insert^'^  and the remaining gunpowder  F'gss- filled in above it. Thus, the ^'s-^-  cartridge is in the middle of the  charge, and the long conducting  wires still project several feet  above the rock  not tamped in the usual way  A wadding of straw or tow is  carefully pushed down the hole,  so that a space filled with air, of  variable size according to circum- ^<^^  stances, remains between it and ''^^  the charge. Upon this wad dry #^^  sand is poured until the bore is :^;  entirely filled, ^â–   The two separate ends of the cartridge wires  must now be brought into connexion by con-  ducting wires with the battery 60 to 90 feet  ofi\". The conductors are also covered wires  about one line in diameter, placed side by side  and kept close together by being wound over  with twine throughout their whole length,  with the exception of their extremities^ where they are to be connected  with the battery and with the cartridge wires.  It is sometimes necessary that the person who has to ignite the  cbarge should still be further off from the charge than the battery is,  and for this purpose an arrangement must be made by which the  circuit may be closed from a distance.  Eoberts contrived the following arrangement for this purpose : upon  two opposite ends of the box which contains the battery two v/ooden  posts are erected, connected above by a wooden rod of one inch in  diameter. At one end a tin disk, A, fig. 60, three to four inches in  Fi\". 80.   %   ^   ^â– Â«!v\\^\\    diameter, is fastened, to which a wire is soldered conducting to one,  say the positive pole of the battery. Another tin disk, B, is fastened  to a tin tube, made to slide easily on the rod, and this is kept from  A by a spiral spring. One end, D, of this spiral is connected with  one of the conducting wires, while the other conducting wire leads to  the negative pole of the battery. The disk B is therefore connected   EECEST PSOGEESS IN PHYSICS. 419  tlirougli a long circuit, including the fine igniting'wires, with the nega-  tive pole, so thatfB may be considered the negative pole and A the  positive. The current circulates and produces ignition in the iron  wire as soon as A and B come into contact.  In order to pull the disk B towards A from a distance, two pieces of  twine fastened to B pass through holes in the disk A, and at E are  connected with the long string that reaches to the place whence the  person who is to close the circuit stands. An accidental discharge  is prevented by a peg F between A and B, which must be removed  before the two disks can come in contact. But besides lessening the  danger this method of blasting oifers other considerable advantages;  it enables us v/ithout much difficulty to explode powder under water.  For this purpose the entire charge is to be enclosed in a water-tight  tin box and this put in the place where its action is desired.  The application of galvanic ignition is also very advantageous when  great masses of rock are to be blasted. Formerly, in such cases, it  was necessary to use a heavy charge in one great mine, but several  smaller properly distributed charges would produce a much greater  effect if they could be ignited simultaneously. This can now be done  by the aid of the galvanic current ; the connecting wires have only to  be so arranged that all the holes are at the same time in the circuit.  In this way immense effects have been obtained in England.  What power the battery must have in each case can easily be ascer-  tained from preceding sections. From section 59 can be ascertained what  force of current is required to make the thin iron wire incandescent,  (the diameter of which must of course be known,) and after computing  the resistance in the conducting wires, it is easy to determine how  many cups or pairs of plates of any give point must be used and how  they must be arranged to produce this force of current.  Â§ 64. The voltaic arc. â€” By the construction of the constant battery,  ! the production of the arc of light which Davy was the first to observe  is greatly facilitated, and hence this interesting phenomenon has beeE  several times investigated, though much is still left for furthei  researches.  De la Kive paid great attention to the galvanic arc; v;-e take tha  following from his elaborate treatise on this subject, published in  Phil. Trans., f. 1847, (Pogg. Ann., LXXVI, 170.)  The voltaic arc can be produced not only between carbon points but  also between points of different metals. It is greater with the more  fusible or oxydisable metals, as zinc or iron, than with platinum or  silver. The size of the arc of light is proportioned to the greater or  less facility with which the substance of the electrode disintegrates ;  for since this phenomenon is produced by minute particles ot  matter carried over from one electrode to the other, its formation must  necessarily be favored by a less cohesion of the electrodes; this is also  the reason why, under otherwise like conditions, the greatest arc of  light is always obtained between carbon points. The transference of  the matter is always from the positive to the negative pole. In the  air and with metallic electrodes, the deposit upon the negative pole   420 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  always consists of oxydized particles of tlie metal used as tlie positive  electrode.  If the negative pole has the form of a plate, while the positive pole  is a point, the deposit of the transferred matter upon the plate  forms a very regular ring, the centre of which is the projection of the  point upon the plate.  When the arc of light is taken between a metallic point and an  opposite surface of mercury, the latter, when positive rises in a cone,  but forms a cavity when negative. In this case it is very difficult to  observe accurately the minutias of the phenomenon^ on account of the  great quantity of mercurial vapor evolved.  De la Rive made experiments with plates and points of platinum,  iron, silver, and copper, but I cannot enter upon the details of the  experiments, because there is much that is not clear to my mind ; in  many cases, for instance, I cannot see in the individual experiments  the proof and confirmation of the generalizations announced. A  repetition of these experiments and an accurate description, illustrated  when practicable with figures, seems therefore very desirable.  Â§ 65. Intensity of light of the voltaic arc. â€” Casselmann has made  experiments upon the intensity of light of the voltaic arc, which have  been described in the memoir already mentioned. They were after-  wards also copied into Poggendorf's Annals. â€” (Pog. Ann., LXIII,  576.) The photometer used in his experiments was constructed upon  the same principles as that described in the third edition of my Lehr-  huch der Physik, vol. II, 674. The carbon pieces, between which the  arc was taken, were of the same composition as that used in the cylin-  ders of Bunsen's battery, but prepared also in other ways, as some of  them were saturated in solutions of nitrate of strontium, boracic acid,  (fee, and then intensely ignited. Thus prepared they gave a very  steady light, differently colored, according to the solution employed ;  and the carbon points could (with a Bunsen battery of 44 cups) be re-  moved to a distance of 7 to 8 millimetres before it disappeared, while  the unsteady light of unprepared carbon went out at a distance of 5  millimetres.  A tangent compass was at the same time inserted into the circuit,  80 that for each measurement of the intensity of light the correspond-  ing force of current could be determined.  The brightest parts of the whole light, it is well known, are at the  points of the two pieces of carbon, upon which the arc rests. In the  following table the intensity of the whole light is compared with that  of a stearine candle, and for each kind of carbon, with the points once  at a very small, and then at the greatest possible distance. The values  of the force of current are reduced to the chemical unit.

By most of the  substances with which the carbon had been prepared, the arc of light  was made more steady and allowed of a greater distance of the points,  but the intensity was not greater, except with the carbon prepared  with borax and sulphuric acid.  But the results in the above table are only approximately accurate,  since the changeable position of the most brilliant points at the origin  of the arc may have prevented the light from acting with its full in-  tensity upon the photometer. In another series of experiments, an  abstract of which is given in the following table, this error was  avoided, the arc of light having been directed towards the photometer  by means of a magnet. In these experiments only 34 Bunsen's cups  were used, the distance of the carbon points was not changed, and the  intensity of the light was measured for different degrees of force of  current.

It follows from these experiments that the intensity of light in-  creases in a somewhat greater ratio than the force of the current.   422 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  l!  It is to be regretted that we have no measures of the intensities of â–   the galvanic light, when different metals are used instead of the  carbon points.  Fizeau and Foucault have also made comparative experiments on the  intensity of the galvanic arc light, but from another point of view. â€”  (Ann. cie Chim. et de Phys. ser. Ill, T. XI, pp. 370; Pog. Ann.,  LXIII, 463.) They did not compare the intensity of the light from \\  different sources, but its chemical effect. In this way they compared 1  the galvanic light with that of the sun, and of lime incandescent in i  detonating gas. The experiment was conducted in the following ;;  manner: An iodized silver plate was inserted in a camera obscura, in i  the place where the image of the sun or of the light, emanating from ]  the carbon or lime, was formed. After a short action of the light the :'  camera obscura v/as closed, and the position changed, so that another â–   image of the object was shown upon the prepared silver plate beside :  the first one ; the exposure was somewhat longer than before ; for a i  third place still longer, &c. The plate was then put into the mercury '  bath and examined, in order to find which one of the images became :  visible by the action of the mercurial vapor. In this way it was ascer-  tained how long the light had to act in order to produce that change '  in the iodide of silver, which is necessary for the condensation of the  mercurial vapor.  If all the other circumstances were entirely identical, the time re-  quired for the production of the Daguerrean image would be nearly â–   inversely proportional to the chemical intensity of the corresponding  sources of light.  But Fizeau and Foucault used for their experiments with the arti-  ficial light lens of shorter focus than for obtaining images of the sun ;  the aperture of the lens also was varied by means of diaphragms.  These circumstances have, therefore, to be taken into account.  If the image is n times further from the lens, it will, caBteris  paribus, be n times greater in its linear diriiensions, and will, there-  fore, cover a surface n^ times as large, and consequently the in-  tensity of light at each point of the image will be n^ times less.  The chemical power of the source of light may, therefore, be con-  sidered proportional to the square of the distance of the image formed  from the lens.  But it is also, as easily perceived, inversely proportional to the sur-  face of the opening of the lens, i. e., to the square of its radius, and  therefore  T_ d^  when J denotes the chemical power of the source of light, d the dis-  tance of the image from the lens, r the radius of its opening, and t  the time required to produce a Daguerrean image.  If we denote by Â« the angle which the radius of the aperture of the  lens subtends at the place of the image, then  â€” = tang, a  a Â°  therefore J = r~^  t. tang, a   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 423  By this, or ratlier by a similar equivalent formula, Fizeau and  Foiicault compufced the results of their observations, and thus obtained  the following relative values for the intensity of the sources of light.  Sun-light, in August and September, at noon, with a clear sky 1000  Garhon-ligldj produced by 46 Bunsen's zinc-carbon cups 235  Lime-light , 6.8  The lime-light appears to be surprisingly little ; but Fizeau  and Foucault found with the common photometrical method a similar  relation between the lights from lime and carbon. No other com-  parative measurements are known to which these can be referred ; a  careful experimental re-examination of the matter is, therefore, de-  sirable.  In reference to the change of the intensity of the carbon-light with  the number and magnitude of the galvanic elements we hud the fol-  1 lowing data in this memoir : While a battery of 46 Bunsen's elements  gave an intensity of light of 235, this was increased to 238 only when  the number of cups was augmented to 80 ; but a battery of 46 triple  cups gave an intensity of 385, after having been already in action  for one hour.  In consequence of the rapid alteration of the fluid â€” the diluted sul-  j)huric acid becoming gradually a solution of sulphate of zinc â€” the  force of the battery, and with it the intensity of the arc of light pro-  duced by it, decreases rapidly. While 80 cups afforded at first an  intensity of 238, this after three hours was diminished to 159.  It is to be regretted that these physicists have not measured the  force of current corresponding to the intensity of light, whereby  the value of the above given numerical relations would have been  very much enhanced.  Â§ 66. Production of heat hy the voltaic arc. â€” The heat developed at  the poles, between which the arc is taken, is entirely too great to be  attributed to the mere passage of the electric current through these  conductors. According to the experiments mentioned in Â§ 57, a cur-  rent, to make a platinum wire of 0.75 mm. in diameter incandescent  by its passage, must have at least a force of 1^>0. Therefore, to make  a platinum wire .of 3 mm. in diameter only white-hot requires, at the  very least, the enormous force of current of 640 ; and yet with the cur-  rent of a Bunsen's battery of 44 cups and a force of 80 to 100, we can  produce an arc in which the point of a platinum wire of more than 3  mm. in diameter may easily be melted into a globule, if used as one  pole of the battery while the other is formed by a carbon point. _ The  combustion of carbon is so trifling that it cannot essentially contribute  to the great heat produced ; besides, the fusion of the platinum wire  by the galvanic arc takes place in a vacuum as readily as in the opeu  air.  The electric current, therefore, besides producing heat by its mere  passage through the conductors, in forming the arc rnust act at the  pole itself to produce heat in some other way, of which as yet we  know nothing-  The development of heat is not equal at the two poles of the arc ;  it is greater at the positive than in the negative. De la Rive, in his   424 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  treatise already mentioaed, in Â§ 64, adds, in reference to this fact, the  following observations : .  When, in forming the arc, a positive metallic point is opposite to a  negative plate, the point becomes ignited throughout, while on invert-  ing the poles the negative point is heated at its extremity only.  If two points of the same metal are opposed to each other the posi-  tive one becomes more intensely ignited, and over a greater length.  If they are of different metals^ of course that one becomes most in-  tensely ignited which is made of the worst conducting metal.  To this category belongs also an observation of Walker, made with  a Daniell's battery of 160 cups. â€” (Trans, of the Lond. Electr. Soc, pp.  65 and 71; Pog. Ann., LV, 62.) He laid the pole wires crosswise,  but so that after the contact they were again moved to a little distance  from each other, and a short arc of light passed between them. Under  these circumstances the positive end of the wire, from the point of  crossing, became so intensely hot that it softened and bent, while the  negative end remained comparatively cold.  Experiments on the heating effects of the voltaic arc have been  made on the greatest scale by Despretz. He collected, in Paris, 500  sine-carbon cups, and arranged a battery of 124 elements, each con-  sisting of four Bunsen's cups. When a piece of sugar carbon, in a  glass globe exhausted to 5 millimetres, was brought between the poles  it became intensely ignited and the globe was covered with a dry,  crystalline black powder. Carbon from gas retorts produced the same  effects. This shows a sublimation of the carbon.  Desprelz thinks too that he observed traces effusion of the carbon.  At any rate his experiments show that carbon evaporates more readily  than it melts. He believes that it could be melted in metallic vessels  in an atmosphere of compressed nitrogen. Similar in behavior to  carbon are lime, magnesia, oxide of zinc, &c. Alumina, rutil,  anatase, nigriue, oxide of iron, &c., form at first small globules, but  afterwards evaporate.  Previous to these experiments with 496 cups Despretz had used a bat-  tery of 165 elements, and combined the heat of its arc with that of the  oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe and of the sun concentrated through a sec-  tional lens 90 centimetres in diameter. The effect of the galvanic  battery was increased by the addition of the other sources of heat. â€”  (Comptes Rendus, July, 1849, No. 3 ; Dingler's Polytechnic Jour-  nal, CXIV, 342.)  Â§ 67. Influence of magnetism upon the voltaic arc. â€” That magnetic  forces have an influence upon the position and form of the arc has  already been observed by Davy, and it is known that this arc is  affected by a niagnet in the same manner as a movable conductor when  a galvanic current is passing through it ; the terrestrial magnetism,  therefore, must also act upon it. By the motion of the heated air the  arc of light is always carried upwards, so as to form a curve, convex  above. If we conceive a perpendicular plane to be passed through  the carbon points lying horizontally, the action of terrestrial magnet-  ism will be such that the highest point of 'the arc will never be in this  plane, but on one side or the other.    RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS 425  Casselmann, in his treatise already mentioned, in Â§ 56, gives ex-  periments on this subject. If, with opposite horizontal carbon points,  the current was passing â€”  From The deviation of the apex was to wauls  N. to S. E. â€¢  W.toE. N.  S. to N. W.  E. toW. S.  This can be easily deduced. In fig. 61 a and b represent the two  horizontal carbon points between which the Piâ€ž gi  arc is produced. If now we imagine a per-  pendicular plane passed through a and b,  and a straight line to pass perpendicularly  through the plane between these points, as  indicated by the arrow, then a steel needle  placed in this line would be magnetized by  the current of the arc, and its N. end would  be at the point of the arrow when the posi-  tive current is passed from a through the arc towards h. But by the  influence of the terrestrial magnetism the N. end of the needle would  dip, and in like manner also the arc will be inclined from the vertical  plane towards the direction of the N. end of the needle.  If a is to the west, and b east, the inclination will be toward the  north when the current is passing from a to b ; but with a direction  of the current from east to west, the north end of the supposed mag-  netic needle would be on the south side of the arc, and the latter,  therefore, would incline toward the south.  By means of this supposed magnetic needle we can, under all cir-  cumstances, determine in what manner the arc will be affected by  terrestrial magnetism or either pole of a magnet, or what must be its  position when placed between the two poles of a horse-shoe magnet.  If, instead of one of the carbon poles, a magnetic bar is used, so that  the arc is formed between carbon and steel, the arc rotates around the  magnetic pole according to the same laws which apply when a mova-  ble current rotates around a fixed magnet. The first notice in refer-  ence to this rotation of the arc is given by Walker, in the \" Transac-  tions of the London Electrical Society\" from 1837 to 1840.â€” (Pog.  Ann., LIY, 514.) De la Rive also has made experiments on the in-  fluence of magnetism upon the voltaic arc, but in a different way.  Their description is found in the memoir mentioned already in Â§ 64.  I shall quote here from De la Rive's memoir literally, in order to  give a characteristic example of his want of precision in writing, by  which his papers are frequently rendered obscure, as before men-  tioned :  \" If two points of soft iron, acting as electrodes, be botb placed  within a helix formed of thick copper wire of several coils, the voltaic  arc developed between the two points of iron ceases the moment a  strong current is passed through the wire of the helices, and reappears  if this current be arrested before the points have become cold. The  arc cannot be formed between the two iron points when they are mag-  netized, whether by the action of the helices or by that of a powerful   426 EECENT PEOGRESS IN PHYSICS.  magnet, unless they be brought much nearer to one another, and the  appearance of the phenomenon is then entirely different. The trans-  ported particles appear to disengage themselves with difficulty from  the positive electrode, sparks fly with noise in all directions, while in  the former case it was a vivid liglit without sparks and without noise,  accompanied by the transfer of a liquid mass, and this appeared to be  effected with the greatest ease. It is of little moment with respect to  the result of the experiment whether the two rods of magnetized iron  present to that part of their extremities between which the luminous  arc springs the same magnetic poles or different poles.  ''The positive electrode of iron, when it is strongly magnetized,  produces, the moment that the voltaic arc is formed between it and a  negative electrode of whatever nature, a very intense noise, analogous  to the sharp hissing sound of steam issuing from a locomotive engine.  This noise ceases simultaneously with the magnetization.  \" For the purpose of better analyzing these different phenomena,  I placed an electro-magnet of large dimensions and great power in  such a manner as to enable me to place on each of its poles, or be-  tween thom, different metals destined to form one of the electrodes  of the pile, while one point of the same metal, or another substance,  acted as the other electrode. I have alike employed as electrodes,  placing them in the same circumstances, two points of the same metal,  or of different metals. The following are the results which I have  obtained : A plate of platinum was placed on one of the poles of the  electro-magnet, and a point of the same metal was placed vertically  above it ; the voltaic arc was produced between the plate and the  point, the plate being positive and the point negative. As soon as  the electro-magnet was charged a sharp hissing was heard. It be-  came necessary to bring the point nearer to the plate to enable the arc  to continue, and the bluish circular spot which the platinum plate  presented became larger than when the experiment was made beyond  the influence of the electro-magnet.  t \" The plate was made negative, and the point positive. The effect  was then totally different. The luminous arc no longer maintained  its vertical direction when the electro-magnet was charged, but took  an. oblique direction, as if it had been projected outwards towards the  margin of the plate. ff It was broken incessantly, each time accompa-  nied by a sharp and sudden noise, similar to the discharge of a Leyden  jar. The direction in which the luminous arc is projected depends  upon the direction of the current producing it, as likewise on the po-  sition of the plate on one or other of the two poles, or between the poles  of the electro- magnet. A plate and a point of silver, a plate and a  point of copper, and generally a plate and a point of any other metal,  provided it be not metal too easily fused, present the same phenomena.  \"Copper, and still more silver, present a remarkable peculiarity.  Plates of these two metals retain on their surfaces the impression of the  action that took place in the experiments just described. Thus, when  the plate is positive, that portion of its surface lying beneath the nega-  tive point presents a spot in the form of a helix, as if the melted metal  in this locality had undergone a gyratory motion around a centre,, at the   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 427  same time that it was uplifted in the shape of a cone towards the  point.  The first part of this is clear ; not so the last two paragraphs. The  passage between f and ft appears to indicate that the oblique direc-  tion of the arc of light only occurs when the plate is negative and  the point positive ; but somewhat further on we read that the direc-  tion in which the luminous arc is projected depends upon that of the  exciting current. It should, therefore, take place when the plate is  positive and the point negative. Besides, an obscure allusion to the  rotation of the arc is found in this passage, but so obscure that one  not previousl)'' acquainted with the phenomenon could form no idea  of it from this representation. That the Genevan physicist, in penning  this passage, actually had this rotation in view is evident from the  conclusion of the last paragraph. Similar faults frequently occur in  De la Hive's treatises ; his description rarely gives a clear and intelli-  gible representation of the phenomenon. It is much to be regretted  that in this way the results of many a beautiful and difficult experi-  mental research are only imperfectly presented to those engaged in  physical studies.  Â§ 68. Use of the galvanic light for illumination. â€” It was to be expected  that the great intensity of the galvanic carbon light would soon lead  to the idea of employing it for illumination after its production was  so much facilitated by the invention of the constant batteries.  Deleuil several times made public experiments with this kind of  illumination. At first he illuminated the pavilion of a mansion at  the Pontneuf, in Paris, with 98 zinc-carbon elements. Acherau made  similar experiments in the Place dela Concord. â€” (Dingler's Polytech.  Journal, vol. 91, p. 324.)  Though the intensity of the galvanic carbon light is enormous, and  although a battery of 48 Buusen's elements produces as much light as  63 common gas barners, yet the use of the galvanic light for public  illumination appears unfit for practical application for the following  reasons :  An immense quantity of light is here emanating from one single  point, and therefore very strong contrasts between light and shade  will be produced ; the darkness in the shade will be the more unideasant  just on account of its contrast to the dazzling light. At any rate, the  illumination obtained from 63 gas burners, perfectly distributed, will  be more uniform and agreeable than an equivalent light concentrated  in one |)oint.  Another objection to the application of the galvanic carbon light,  is the difficulty of keeping its intensity uniform for a long time.  In consequence of the formation of sulphate of zinc the conducting  power of the fluid decreases so rapidly that the force of the current,  even in half an hour, becomes considerably weaker than it was at the  beginning. But, apart from this, the maintenance of the battery is  extremely expensive, because much more zinc is consumed than the  current itself requires, and the nitric acid acts destructively upon the  metallic rings around the carbon cylinders. It is true the disadvan-  tages of this action of the nitric acid could be avoided by the use of  Daniell's elements, but then the battery must be considerably enlarged  to obtain the same effect.   428   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   Fig. 62.    In an economical point of view, therefore, the galvanic illumina-  tion of streets, halls, theatres^, &c., does not appear advantageous.  But there is yet another difficulty ; the management of the battery  and of the whole apparatus is too complicated to be confided to such.  persons as generally have charge of the illumination ; tlie carbon  points are continually changing, and their position, therefore, must  be continually regulated in order to keep the light uniform and pre-  vent its extinction. It is difficult to accomplish this regulation by  mechanical means, though different contrivances have been proposed  for the purpose, Le Molt, for instance, obtained a patent in England,  in 1848, for an apparatus for galvanic illumination, in which carbon  disks, with the form represented in fig. 62, take the place  of the points. Two of these disks are placed with their  sharp edges opposite each other ; their axes rotate uni-  formly by means of clock work, and their distances are  regulated by a metallic spring.  It is therefore scarcely to be expected that the applica-  tion of galvanism to public illumination will have any  practical success. But Donne and Foucault have obtained very  favorable results from their experiments, in which the galvanic carbon  light was substituted for the incandescent lime in the so called gas  microscope.  A tolerably complete description of the photo-electric microscope of  Donne and Foucault maybe found in the 4th edition of Pouillet, Ele-  ments de Physique Experimentale, &c., vol. II, pp. *746. We can  here only indicate the most essential parts of the apparatus. The  luminous arc is produced between sticks of carbon cut from the hard  carbon of gas retorts ; they are made  ^''^s-G3. jj2 the shape represented in fig. 63, the  negative electrode being pointed and  n lÂ» the positive blunt. These carbon pieces  ^^^^^H^^^SB- ^^^^^M apg gQ }^gl(j tl^r^^ their position can  easily be regulated.  A general idea of the arrangement of the illuminating apparatus  of this microscope may be gathered from the diagram fig. 64. a is a  concave mirror of an aperture of about  i decimetre, and a radius of 1.6 de-  cimetre. The carbon light is at b, a  little nearer to the mirror than c, the  centre of its curvature, and somewhat  higher, so that the rays emanating  from b are collecl'ed at /, v/here the  ininute object to be magnified is in-  tensely illuminated. The system of  lens through which the magnified  image of the object is thrown upon a  screen 4 to 5 metres distant is precisely the same as in the solar  microscope.  To diminish the great heat at /, a vessel is placed between the  mirror and b, the sides of which are made of polished plate glass; it  it is filled with a solution of alum by which a great part of the calo-   Fig. 64.    EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS, 429  rific rays is absorbed witbout sensibly lessening tbe intensity of tbe  ligbt.  The image of tbe arc of ligbt itself, as produced at/ by tbe concave  mirror, may be taken as tbe object to be magnified tbrougb tbe lens, but  then tbe magnifying power must be lower. Thus, a highly magnified  image of the arc of light is obtained I upon the white screen, and all  the phenomena accompanying it can be observed with ease.  But the magnified image of tbe galvanic arc of ligbt can also be  produced by much simpler means ; it has only to be brought directly  near tbe focus of a lens of 1 to 3 centimetre focal distance. Of course,  care must be taken that the carbon light is so inclosed that no light  falls upon tbe screen, except that which passes through the lens.  Â§ 69. Galvanic illumination of mines. â€” The remarks on galvanic  illumination in general are also applicable to the proposal to illumi-  nate mines by the light produced by means of galvanism ; there is  scarcely much practical success to be expected. Because the galvanic  carbon light can be produced in a' vacuum and even under water.  Boussingault believed that it could be used instead of Davy's safety  lamp in mines where inflammable gases make open lamps dangerous.  But in mines an intense light at any one place is never wanted, but  a feeble one at many difierent places. The same objection is to be  made to De la Rive's proposal to pass in a hermetically closed glass  balloon the positive current from an upright carbon cylinder to a me-  tallic one placed vertically above it. â€” (Dingler's Polyt. Journal,  XCVIII, p. 153, and 232 ; Moniteur industr., 1845, No. 961 & 965.)  Grove proposed, instead' of the carbon light, the ignition of a pla-  tinum wire by galvanism in a hermetically closed glass vessel. â€”  (Dingler's Polyte'cbnic Journal, XCIX, p. 201 ; Phil. Magazine, Dec,  1845, p. 442.) He gives to the wire the form of a spiral, and thus  employs a greater length of it in a smaller space ; and this arrange-  ment has the further advantage that on account of the less rapid cool-  ing the coiled wire is more intensely heated with an equal force of  current than the same wire when extended in a straight line.  Grove does not give any details as to the length and diameter of  tbe wire used, or of the precise construction of the spiral. With two  to three constant elements a uniform light was obtained during several  hours. Grove experimented (and read) by this light ; but this notice  gives only a very imperfect idea of the illuminating power of the  apparatus. In mines this light will probably be sufficient, and the  proposition therefore appears to be a more practical one than the ap-  plication of the carbon light, especially on account of the small  number of constant elements required for tbe purpose. But still , even  this apparatus will be more expensive and complicated than Davy's  safety lamp, and consequently its general introduction into use is  scarcely to be expected.  King uses, instead of tbe platinum spiral, a strip of very thin pla-  tinum foil,, and makes it incandescent by the galvanic current. â€”  (London Journal of Arts, June, 1846, p. 348 ; Dingler's Polytechnic  Journal, CI, p. 12.)  Â§ 70. Tlie galvanic sparJc. â€” Most of the observers who have experi-  mented with .the galvanic arc have noticed that the two poles must first   430 RECENT PEOGRESG IN PHYSICS,  \"be brought into contact before the current can be produced. After  the carbon points have once been in contact, they may be separated  from each other and then the luminous arc is formed. The arc also  can be produced by discharging the spark of a Leyden jar between the  carbon points, instead of bringing them into contact, as has been  observed by Daniell, (Phil. Trans., 1839, 89 ; Pog. Ann. LX, 312,)  and previously by Sturgeon. â€” (Ann. of Electr., VIII, 507 ; Pog. Ann.  XLIX, 122.) The latter believes that this experiment originated  with Herschel. The formation of the current in this case is evidently  caused by conducting particles carried from one pole to the other by  the spark.  Even the powerful batteries which have been u.^ed to produce the  luminous arc have not yet sufficient tension to effect the passage of a  spark through the smallest distance.  Jacobi found by accurate measurement that the poles of a battery  of 12 zinc-platinum elements could be brought to within 0.00005 inch  of each other without a spark passing. â€” (Bulletin of the Petersburgh  Academy; Pog. Ann., XLIV, 633.)  Gasf-iot obtained distinct sparks from his great water batterv. â€”  (Phil. Trans , f. 1844, pt. I, pp. 39 ; Pog. Ann , LXV, 476.) this  remarkable battery consisted of 3,520 glass tumblers, each containing  a zinc rod and a copper cylinder. They were charged with rain  water. The tumblers were distributed upon 44 oaken boards, every  11 of which were combined in a stand, similar to the shelves of a book  case, and were supported by four strong pillars. Especial care was  taken to secure perfect insulation, the glasses were varnished and  placed upon glass plates, and these as well as the boards were in like  manner covered with varnish.  It might be expected that this battery, when the circuit was unclosed,  should exliibit in a decided manner the phenomenon of tension, and,  in fact, the leaves of a gold leaf electroscope diverged already, when  yet at a distance of 2 or 3 inches from one of the poles.  As soon, however, as the battery was closed, all signs of tension  disappeared. When the poles of the battery were brought within  0.02 inch of each other sparks continually passed between them. lu  one case this phenomenon continued day and night for five weeks  without interruption. Several months after its constructiou the  battery showed no signs of decrease in strength.  fctince the ordinary galvanic batteries have no striking distance at  all, it is evident that the appearance of light observed in opening and  closing even simple batteries, must be an entirely different phenomenon  from that of the common electric spark.  In the memoir just mentioned, Jacobi states it as his opinion that  the usual galvanic spark is a phenomenon of ignition and combustion ;  the extremely fine points which first come into contact and permit the  conduction of the current, become incandescent and burn, and thus pro-  duce, according to Jacobi's opinion, the phenomenon of light. There  is no doubt that with more vivid sparks such ignition and combustion  really do occur, but then the phenomenon is no longer a simple one ; '  in closing and opening a battery the spark is observed under circum-  stances which make ignition and combustion very improbable.   REGENT PEOGKESS IN PHYSICS. 431  Neef has shown that this appearance of light, when occurring  simply without the action of secondarj^ currents, is neither a common  electric spark, viz., a spark j)a.ssing from one pole to the other, nor  can it be attributed to a combustion of metal. â€” (P. A. LXVI, 414.)  In his so called magnet electrometer, as described in the 3d edition  of my ^' Lehi'buch der PJiysik,\" vol. II, p. 251, a continual closing  and breaking of the current takes place at c which is accompanied by  a corresponding ap^^earance of the light. But in this form of the  apparatus the observation of the phenomenon is rendered, difficult by  the width of the hammer which strikes the platinum plate. In a very  convenient modification of this apparatus by Desaga_, in Heidelberg,  which will be described hereaiter, a platinum point is substituted for  the hammer, so that the contact is made and broken in rapid alterna-  tion between a platinum point and plate.  When the apparatus is in action, light is observed, at the place of  separation, which, on account of the rapidity of the oscillation, seems  to be contiDuous. To the naked eye, when protected from the day-  light, the light appears violet, whether the positive current pass from  the point to the plate or inversely ; but the point of light is so ex-  tremely small that Neef was induced to examine the phenom.enon with  the microscope. By the aid of this instrument he found that the light  always a,ppears at the negative pole only.  The;^e observations are best made with a microscope which magnifies  25 to 50 times, which permits the objective to be removed to at least 1^  inch from the point of light.  When the positive current passes from the plate to the point, the  latter appears enveloped in violet light, while the plate remains en-  tirely dark.  At the lowest extremity of the point within the continuous violet  light there appear single, extremely fine, dots of dazzling white light  with a sort of swarming motion ; and tov/ards the upper extremity of  the violet envelope there is also seen light of the same color but of  much greater intensity, flashing out, and yet no passage to the other  pole could be observed. The last mentioned flashing gradually dis-  appears as the force of the current decreases.  When the current passes in the opposite direction, and the point, con-  sequently, is positive, it remains quite dark and the violet light is  spread upon the plate around the point of nearest approach. In this  case, too, there is no spark, strictly so called, to be observed, and the  uniform violet glimmering light can scarcely be attributed to a com-  bustion of the platinum. Besides, Neef also especially remarks that  this phenomenon of light takes place at the negative pole only, while  the greatest heat is always developed at the positive pole.   CONTENTS.

[PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND  ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 13, 1847.]   INTEODUCTION.   General considerations ivhich should serve as a guide in adopting a  Plan of Organization.  1. Will op Smithson. The property is bequeathed to the United  States of America, \" to found at Washington, under the name of the  Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffu-  sion of knowledge among men.\"  2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government of  the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the  testator.  3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently  supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and  perpetuate his name.  4. The objects of the Institution are, 1st, to increase, and 2d, to  diffuse knowledge among men.  5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.  The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addi-  tion of new truths ; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus  increased, among men.  (i. The will makes no restriction in lavor of any particular kind of  knowledge ; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.  7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating  and promoting the discovery of new truths ; and can be most exten-  sively diffused among men by means of the press.  8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should  be such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of  increasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either  at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.  9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provi-  sionally, can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or be  abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.  10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time  occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the iDstitution,   8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.  a considerable portion of the interest which, has accrued should be  added to the principal.  11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated,  the funds are small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the  construction of the building ; and not only the first cost of the edifice  should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in  repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected  with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-  ported by the Institution.  12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined  by the plan of organization, and not the converse.  13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be bene-  fitted by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure  on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.  14. Besides the foregoing considerations deduced immediately from  the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements  of the act of Congress establishing the Institution These are, a  library, a museum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal  scale to contain them.  SECTION I.  Flan of Organization of the Institution in accordance ivith thetforegoing  deductions from the will of Smithson.  To Increase Knowledge. It is proposed â€”  1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-  ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths ; and  2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular  researches, under the direction of suitable persons.  To Diffuse Knowledge. It is proposed â€”  1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the  different branches of knowledge ; and  2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general  interest.  DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.  I. â€” By stimulating researches.  1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all  branches of knowledge.  2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of volumes,  in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to Know-  ledge.  3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for  publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human  knowledge, resting on original research ; and all unverified sj)ecula-  tions to be rejected.  4. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for  examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in   PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. Â»  the branch to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for pub-  lication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.  5. The commission to be chosen by the officars of the Institution,  and the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a  favorable decision be made,  6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions  of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to all the  colleges and principal libraries in this country. One part of the  remaining copies may be offered for sale; and the other carefully pre-  served, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand from  new institutions.  7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs  to be given to the public through the annual report of the Kegents to  Congress.  II. â€” By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects  of research, under the direction of suitable persons.  1. The objects, and the amount appropriated, to be recommended  by counsellors of the Institution.  2. Appropriations in different years to different objects, so that, in  course of time, each branch of knowledge may receive a share.  3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published,  with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithsonian  Contributions to Knowledge.  4. Examples of objects for which appropriations maybe made.  (1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving the  problem of American storms.  (2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,  magnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the  formation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.  (3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determination  of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of light;  chemical analyses of soils and plants; collection and publication of  scientific facts, accumulated in the offices of government.  (4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,  moral, and political subjects.  (5.) Historical researches and accurate surveys of places celebrated  in American history.  (6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the dif-  ferent races of men in North America; also, explorations and accurate  surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people of our  country.  DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDQE.  I. â€” By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new  discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year in  all branches of knowledge not strictly professional.  1 . These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally interest-  in g, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the   30 PEOGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.  reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals, as the  income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of knowledge  may indicate.  2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the  different branches of knowledge.  3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publica-  tions, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his report;  to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on the title-  page of the report.  4. The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons  interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it  without purchasing the whole.  5. These reports may be presented to Congress for partial distri-  bution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific  institutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.  The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in  the reports:  I. PHYSICAL CLASS.  1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy^ chemistry,  and meteorology.  2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.  3. Agriculture.  4. Application of science to arts.  II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.  5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,  antiquities, &c.  6. Statistics and political economy.  7. Mental and moral philosophy.  8. A survey of the political events of the world, penal reform, &c.  III. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.  9. Modern literature.  10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.  11. Bibliography.  12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.  II. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.  1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs  translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the  direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the  best exposition of a given subject.  2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission  of competent judges previous to their publication.   PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 11  3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of  the present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in  the table of reports.  SECTION II.  Plan of organization, in accordance ivith the terms of the resolutions of  the Board of Regents 'providing for the two modes of increasing and  diffusing knoiuledge.  1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated  the formation of a library and a museum ; and the Board of Regents,  including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide  the income* into two equal parts.  2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge  by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme  before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation of  a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art.  3. These two plans are not incompatible one with another.  4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required,  consisting, 1st, of a complete collection of the transactions and pro-  ceedings of all the learned societies in the world ; 2d, of the more  important current periodical publications, and other works necessary  in preparing the periodical reports.  5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of  objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.  6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of  experimental science.  7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those men-  tioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the United  States should be procured, in order that the valuable books first pur-  chased may be such as are not to be found in the United States.  8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,  should be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of biblio-  graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any work  which he may require.  9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase  by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-  vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary  to purchase articles of this kind.  10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts  of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.  11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of ex-  pense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other  similar societies.   *The ctmount of the Smithsonian hecjuest received into the Treasury of the  Unitwi States is $515,109 00  Interest on the same to July 1, 1846, (devoted to the erection of the  building) 242,129 00  Annual income from the bequest _ 30.910 14   12 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.  12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of  antiquities, sucli as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.  13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, be-  sides the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except  one, to act as librarian.  14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to_  the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,  keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and  keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents,  employ assistants.  15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,  will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit  new objects of art ; distinguished individuals should also be invited to  give lectures on subjects of general interest.   This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has be-  come the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change  is that expressed by the following resolutions adopted January 15,  1855, viz:  Resolved, That the 7th resolution, passed by the Board of Regents  on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the in-  come between the active operations and the museum and library,  when the buildings are completed, be and it is hereby repealed.  Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-  tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the  Institution in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,  be necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-  ance, and a compliance in good faith with the law.   REPOET OF THE SECRETARY FOR 1858.   To the Board of Regents of the' Smithsonian Institution :  GentlexMen : The principal event of importance in the history of  the Institution during the past year is the transfer of the government  collections from the Patent Office to the large room of the Smithsonian  building.  It will be recollected that by the law of Congress incorporating this  Institution \"all objects of art and of foreign and curious research,  and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mine-  ralogical specimens belonging to or hereafter to belong to the United  States which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody  the same may be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be author-  ized by the Board of Kegents to receive them.\"  The law thus giving to the Smithsonian Institution all speci-  mens illustrative of nature and art to be found in the several offices  and departments of government was not construed as rendering it  obligatory on the Kegents to accept these objects if they considered  it inexpedient to do so. Inasmuch, then, as this collection was  neither essential to the plan of organization nor directly subservi-  ent to the comprehensive purpose of the donor in regard to a  world-wide benefit, it was the ultimate decision of a majority of the  Board that it ought not to be accepted and that no part of the dona-  tion ought to be expended in the care of property belonging to the  government of the United States.  Previous to the discussion of this question it had been assumed that  the Kegents were under an obligation to take charge of the museum,  and, on this account principally, a large and expensive building had  been thought necessary. After it was settled, however, that the  Kegents were not bound to accept this trust, the work of construction  was carried on more slowly, with a view at once to secure certain  advantages to the building itself, and to increase the principal by  funding the interest of the money which would be absorbed by its  completion.  In the meantime a very large amount of specimens of natural his-   14 EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  tory had accumulated at the lustitution from numerous exploring  parties sent out by the general government; and as these collections had  been made under the direction of the Institution, and their preser-  vation was of the highest importance to the natural history of the  country, it was finally concluded that if Congress would make an  appropriation for the transfer and new arrangement of the articles  then in the Patent Office, and continue the annual appropriation  previously made for their care and exhibition while in charge of the  Commissioner of Patents, the Institution would, under these con-  ditions, become the curator of the national collections. This propo-  sition was agreed to by the government, and the contemplated transfer  has accordingly been made.  It is believed that this arrangement will be mutually beneficial to  the Patent Office and the Institution, since the former will be relieved  from a duty scarcely compatible with the design of its establishment,  and will gain possession of one of the largest rooms in the city for  the exhibition of a class of models to which the public have not pre-  viously had ready access ; while the Smithsonian Institution will be  able to present to the strangers who visit Washington a greater num-  ber of objects of interest, and appropriate that portion of the large  building not required for its own most important operations to a use-  ful purpose.  The cost of keeping the collections at the Patent Office, including  fuel, was about |4,000 annually, but the Regents might with justice  have asked for an additional amount sufficient to pay the interest on  the cost of that portion of the edifice occupied by the museum. It was,  however, thought more prudent to restrict the application to the sum  aboye mentioned, and to request that the appropriation might be con-  tinued under the charge of the Secretary of the Interior, thus obvi-  ating the necessity of an annual application to Congress by the  Institution itself.  The cases at present required for the accommodation of the collec-  tions have been constructed at a cost within the appropriation made  for that purpose ; and the Institution is indebted to Hon. J. Thomp-  son, Secretary of the Interior, and Hon. J. Holt, Commissioner of  Patents, for the use of glass sash and shelving no longer needed in  the room which formerly contained the museum in the Patent Office,  but which have been applied to good purpose in supplying deficiencies  in the Smithsonian building. The Eegents are also indebted to Thos.   KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15  U. Walter, esq., p,rchitect of the United States Capitol extension^ for  the beautiful design of the cases, and to Edw. Clark, esq., architect of  the Interior Deijartment, for the inspection of the work during its  l^rogress and the examination of the accounts })resented by the con-  tractor.  In order to increase the capacity of the large room appropriated to  the collection, the cases have been arranged in two stories, forming a  series of alcoves and a gallery on each side. By the adoption of this  plan space can be provided for double the number of specimens which  were exhibited at the Patent Office.  A considerable portion of the collections has been arranged, and a  taxidermist employed to repair the specimens of zoology which have  been damaged, and to prepare for exhibition others which had not  previously been mounted. The museum will soon be an object of  continued and increasing interest to the inhabitants of the city and to  strangers who visit the capital of the United States.  Among the specimens many duj^licates occur which might be ad-  vantageously distributed perhaps to the principal societies of natural  history in this and other countries ; and I respectfully ask the Board  of Eegents to determine, regarding this point, whether, in their judg-  ment, the Institution can venture to make such distribution without  further instruction from Congress. If within its power, this measure  would seem evidently calculated to further one of the legitimate ends  of the Institution in difiusing more widely the materials of science and  the means of education.  An assent to the arrangement above stated for taking charge of the  government collections is by no means inconsistent with the regret  expressed in previous reports that the law of Congress directed pro-  vision to be made from the Smithsonian fund for a public museum and  library. It must be evident to any one who attentively studies the  past history of the operations of the Institution that the interest of  the money expended on the building intended for this purpose would  have been much more efficiently applied in the development and publica-  tion of new truths. But, in all cases where many views are to be  consulted, the question is not merely what ought to be, but what can  be accomplished. From the first there has existed a clear conception  of the means by which the idea of the donor could be best realized,  and the aim of the majority of the Regents has continually been to  approximate, as nearly as the restrictions of Congress would allow, to  the plan originally proposed. The policy has been invariably the   16 KEPOET OF THE SECRETARY.  same, and the present reputation and generally acknowledged success  of the Institution are the result of this undeviating course.  It is a matter of congratulation to be able to announce to the Board  the continued prosperous financial condition of the Institution. The  investment of the extra fund in State stocks has proved to be judicious.  They now yield the Institution an annual income of upwards of seven  thousand dollars. It may also be mentioned in this place, as a fact of  interest to the friends of the Institution, that from the report of the  governor of Arkansas it appears that the original fund received by  the United States^ from Smithson's bequest, and lent by the govern-  ment to that State, will in due time be repaid, and that the general  government will in no respect be a loser by having accepted the  charge and administration of this trust.  The income of the Institution being payable periodically on the 1st  January and 1st July, it is obvious that the current expenses, which  are continuous, cannot all be met as they accrue. An effort has there-  fore been made for the last two years so to curtail the expenditure as  to accumulate in the treasury a half year's interest. This object will  be full/ accomplished during the next year. For the future, there-  fore, we shall be enabled to pay cash for printing, paper, &c., and  thus save a considerable per centage on the cost of these articles.  Comparatively few repairs have been required during the past year  on the building, though the changes which have been necessary to  accommodate the increasing operations of the Institution have involved  considerable expense. The corridors, which were entirely open to the  northwest wind, have been enclosed with glazed sashes; a large amount  of space has thus been rendered available, and a considerable portion  of the interior of the buildi; 'g. protected from the inclemency of the  weather.  The heating of the building is a heavy item of expense, and must  continue to be so until double windows can be furnished, particularly  on the north side, and a more economical as well as efficient method  of warming be adopted. The whole length of the building is four  hundred and fifty feet, one-third of which, at least, is occupied by a  series of windows, through which the heat of the air within so rapidly  escapes by contact with the cold glass that the cost of inner windows  would be saved in the course of a few years.  The smaller rooms are mostly heated by stoves, and the larger ones  by furnaces. Estimates have been procured for â€ž ubstituting hot water   EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17  apparatus, but the expense of introducing this method is so great that  we would hesitate to advise its adoption at present.  It may be proper again to mention the fact that the grounds on  which the Smithsonian buikling stands, are under the charge of the  Commissioner of Public Buildings, and that, though several thousand  dollars of the income of the Smithsonian fund were originally expended  for their improvement, the Institution has surrendered all control over  them. It is believed, however, that Congress will in due time make  a more liberal appropriation for the improvement of the public Mall,  of which the Smithsonian reservation, as it is sometimes called, forms  a part, and for carrying out the original design of the lamented  Downing, which connects in one common plan a succession of enclosed  parks, extending from the Capitol to the Potomac.  The proposition to supply the public grounds with a complete series  of American trees has long been contemplated, but as no appropria-  tion has been made by Congress for this purpose, the Patent Office,  conjointly with this Institution, has taken the preliminary steps by  issuing a circular asking for seeds of every species of our forest trees  and shrubs that would be likely to thrive in this latitude. This  circular has been widely distributed, and it is hoped will meet with a  favorable response from all who are interested in making more gen-  erally known, and in introducing into more extensive cultivation, the  natural ornamental products of our own soil. The seeds are to be  sent by mail to the Commissioner of Patents, and placed in charge of  the officers having the care of the public grounds.  It may be mentioned in this connexion that the original plan of  Captain Meigs for the supply of the city with water contemplates a  series of fountains to ornament the pub c reservations. To the same  valuable improvement we shall also owe the introduction, probably  during the present year, of a full supply of Potomac water into the  Smithsonian building.  Puhllcations. â€” The publications of the Institution may at present  be divided into three classes : 1st, the \" Contributions to Knowledge,\"  in quarto form ; 2d, the annual report to Congress, printed at the  expense of government ; 3d, irregular series, such as the meteoro-  logical and physical tables, directions for observations, special reports,  &c., in octavo, to which has been given the name of \"Smithsonian  Miscellaneous Collections.\"  The tenth volume of the Contributions has been printed, and is  2   18 REPOET OF THK SECRETARY.  now ready for distribution. It contains the third and concluding  part of the Nereis Boreali Americana, a Grammar and Dictionary of  the Yoruha Language, and the magnetic observations made under  the direction of Dr. Kane during his last Arctic expedition.  The issuing of this volume has been delayed on account of the in-  terruption in the printing of the Yoruba Grammar, caused by the  absence of the author, the Rev. Mr. Bowen. It was, however, essen-  tially completed within the year 1858^ and will bear that date.  The articles which the volume contains have been described in  previous reports, with the exception of the magnetic observations  made by Dr. Kane.  1. It will probably be recollected that the plan of exploration proposed  by Dr. Kane for his last voyage was recommended to the favorable  attention of the Secretary of the Navy by the Smithsonian and other  institutions, and that the expedition was furnished with magnetic  and meteorological instruments jointly by the Coast Survey and this  Institution. The observations above mentioned are a part of those  which were made with these instruments. They were reduced and  prepared for publication at the expense of the Institution, under the  direction of Professor Bache, by Charles A. Schott, esq., and form  additions to our knowledge of the direction and intensity of the mag-  netic force in the inhospitable regions of the north, of sufficient value  to fully justify the interest which was taken in promoting the organi-  zation and the fitting out of the expedition.  The following extracts from the remarks of Professor Bache to the  American Association will serve to exhibit the light in which these  observations were regarded by him, nor can they be otherwise than  acceptable as the expression of an opinion in which all will concur  who were acquainted with our lamented fellow countryman, or who  are capable of appreciating his labors :  \" The scientific reader of the narrative of the second Arctic expe-  dition would be struck by the fact that while in the preface Dr. Kane  disclaimed all pretensions of a scientific character for his work, it  contained, nevertheless, some of the most important contributions to  our knowledge of the natural history and physical phenomena of the  interesting regions visited by the intrepid explorers. Dr. Kane appre-  ciated highly all the relations, direct and indirect, which science has  to an exploring expedition. He was ever careful to surround himself  with those who could, in their special departments^ make valuable   EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19  observations, while his own rare administrative capacity always gave  them opportunity for the exercise of their abilities. Himself an  admirable observer and well trained in the use of instruments, he  was always at hand to direct or to assist, as the occasion might require.  The labors in physical observation of Dr. Kane and his associates  had few parallels when the difficulties to be surmounted and the  results produced are considered.\"  The magnetic observations were projierly placed in the hands of Mr.  Schott for discussion, as he had been selected for similar service by  Dr. Kane himself, and felt a strong interest in the work. The prin-  cipal magnetical results were obtained on the coast of Greenland  during the years 1853-'54-'55, and in regard to the high magnetic and  geographical latitudes in which the observations were made, as well as  the completeness of the observations for diurnal changes of the hori-  zontal needle at a station before unknown to geography, \" they  deserve,\" says Professor Bache, \" the attention of those engaged in  the study of the law of the changes of the magnetic elements in the  Arctic regions.\" At a late meeting of the British Association reso-  lutions were passed making application to the English government to  send a vessel to the vicinity of Mackeozie river to institute obser-  vations with special reference to the determination of the laws now  known to govern the magnetic storms. The resolutions also insist on  the importance of observations in the northern regions. Captain  Younghusband, of the royal navy, remarks, in his discussion of those of  Sir John Richardson, that \"so few observations of the diurnal variation  of the declination in high latitudes are up to this time at command,  that not even an approach can be made towards indicating a general  law of the phenomena in such localities.\"  The Winter Quarters at Van Rensselaer Harbor, where most of the  observations of Dr. Kane were made, is in latitude 78Â° 37', to the  northward and eastward of Cape Alexander, beyond Smith's sound.  The following is an outline of the discussion and of the results  obtained by Mr. Schott from Dr. Kane's magnetic observations at  Van Rensselaer Harbor. The diurnal ranges of the declination were  deduced from observations on seventeen days in January, February, and  March, 1854. The mean diurnal range or motion of the needle was  found equal to 2Â° 29', and the greatest range observed amounted to 4Â°  52'. The results were compared with similar ones at Lake Athabasca,  Fort Simpson, and Port Bowen. A classification was made of the  observed ranges according to their frequency and magnitude. The   20 EEPOET OF THE SECEETART.  values of tlie diurnal inequality of the declination were deduced for  every hour (mean local time) and also compared with similar values  for the same period observed at Greenwich. This inequality at these  two stations presents, in general, the same characteristic features,  namely: the principal deflection of the needle to the west shortly after  noon, and the opposite eastern deflection about midnight. The ex-  treme westerly position at Van Rensselaer Harbor is attained at noon;  the easterly extreme is reached at 2 a. m. A small disturbance is  noted at the hours of 4 and 5 p. m. While the diurnal variation  agrees with that observed at Lake Athabasca, Fort Simpson, Sitka,  Toronto, &c. , it shows no trace of that marked deviation exhibited at  Reikiavik, in Iceland, and Fort Confidence. The results were further  compared with similar ones at Whalefish islands and Port Bowen.  The range of the mean diurnal inequality was 1Â° T'.  The mean disturbance of the declination for each hour was found  greater than at Lake Athabasca and Fort Simpson. The disturbing  force is least from 10 a. m. to 7 p. m., and greatest and equally  regular from 8 p. m. to 8 or 9 a. m. At noon, as at Lake Atha-  basca, Toronto, and Sitka, an increase in the mean disturbance is  noticed. The minimum disturbance takes place at 5 p. m. The  mean monthly disturbance was greatest in February. The recog-  nition and separation of the disturbed observations was effected by  application of a method proposed by Professor Peirce, according to  which, one in every eighteen of the whole number was found disturbed^  that is, differing more than 1^ 38' from the mean, while at Toronto  the disturbance was one in every seventeen. The aurora horealis was  carefully noted, and in no case did the needle show any special  deviation during its occurrence â€” a remarkable circumstance, in con-  sideration of the fact of the great disturbances noted during the  appearance of this phenomenon farther south.  The term-day observations, made once in each month, from January  to July, 1854, were exhibited graphically, and compared with corre-  sponding observations at Washington and Greenwich. The observa-  tions are marked by the absence of any considerable disturbance,  and by the small diurnal range at the time of the equinox. The  absolute declination was determined on three days in June, 1854,  and found to be 108Â° 12' west. The magnetic inclination was obtained  at ten stations, which gave for Van Rensselaer's Harbor a dip of  84Â° 45'. 8 from observations between January, 1854, and May, 1855,   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21  The magnetic intensity was derived from observations of deflections  and vibrations made between January, 1854, and May, 1855, the  magnetic moment of the magnet having been determined at Wash-  ington. From twenty-three separate values the horizontal intensity was  found equal to 1.139, corresponding to the epoch of June, 1854. The  total force was 12.48. In the summer of 1855 the horizontal intensity  at Hakluyt island was found to be 1.344, and at Cape York 1.573.  The remaining series of the Arctic observations under the direction  of Dr. Kane are still in process of reduction ; though a portion of the  tabular matter has been sent to the printer to avoid delay in the pub-  lication, and will be included in the eleventh volume of Smithsonian  Contributions. They relate to temperature, winds, moon culminations,  twilight, halos, moisture, atmospheric pressure, and tides. The mere  enumeration of the objects which engaged the active mind of the  distinguished explorer, is sufficient, when we consider his feeble  physical powers, to account for the untimely loss which science and  humanity have been called on to deplore.  2. Another paper shortly to be put to press consists of an account of  the results of a series of physical observations by Dr. Luis Berlandier,  the notice of which may perhaps be best introduced by a statement  of the following facts given in my Report to the Regents for 1854.  Dr. Luis Berlandier_, a member of the Academy of Geneva, visited  Mexico in 1826 for the purpose of making a scientific examination  of the country. Soon after his arrival he was appointed one of a  commission, organized by the then new republic, with the object  of defining the boundaries, extent, natural resources, &c., of the  northern or frontier States. The position gave him unusual facilities  for observation relative to the character of the country, and for  making collections to illustrate its natural history. He, however,  never returned to his native country, but married and settled in  Mexico, and there continued his researches until the period of his  death in 1851. In the year 1853 Lieutenant Couch, U. S. A., made a  scientific exploration in Mexico under the auspices of the Institution,  and was so fortunate as to procure the manuscripts and collections of  Dr. Berlandier. He presented to this Institution all of those which  related to meteorology and natural history, and offered to sell to  the government at a low price the remainder, containing historical  and geographical information, chiefly pertaining to the States of the  old republic which lay between the -\"iabine and the Sierra Madre. It  is to be regretted that this proposition was not accepted, since in   22 KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  order to reimburse himself for the original cost of the mamiscripts  he was induced to dispose of them to a private individual.  The portions of the manuscripts relating to meteorology were  placed in the hands of Professor Coffin for reduction. They consist,  either in summary or in detail, of the results of a series of nearly three  hundred and fifty thousand observations commenced at Havre, France,  October 14, 1826, and continued during the voyage of Dr. Berlandier  to Tampico, and afterwards at intervals in various parts of Mexico,  chiefly at Matamoras, till April 26, 1851 ; also, of a series taken at  the city of Mexico, in 1827, by General Teran, and at Goliad, Texas,  in 1832 and 1833, by Dr. Raphael Chowell. The whole had been  collected and arranged with care by Dr. Berlandier, preparatory  to a thorough reduction, which was intended to show not only the  mean results, but all the more important relations existing between  different atmospheric phenomena, when death closed his labors, and  put an end to his interesting and useful investigations.  3, The family of the lamented Dr. Hare has presented to the Insti-  tution a paper describing an instrument denominated by its author a  cycloidegraph. It is intended to illustrate the motions of particles of  air when subjected to a gyratory or whirling motion, combined with  one of translation. This instrument, of which a drawing will be  given, evinces the ingenuity and power of mechanical combinations, of  which Dr. Hare gave so many manifestations during the long course  of his industrious and successful scientific career.  The paper is accompanied by engraved illustrations of the curves  produced by the machine, and contains a series of propositions in-  tended to demonstrate the centripetal theory of storms. As the last  contribution to physical science of one of the patrons of the Smith-  sonian Institution, and its first honorary member, it is proper that it  should find a place in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.  4. Thenextcommunication to be mentioned, is an account of obser-  vations made on the great solar eclipse of September 7, 1858, in which  the total shadow of the moon passed obliquely over South America, a  few degrees south of the equator. Accurate observations of the  phenomena presented during the total obscuration of the sun afford  such important means of enlarging our knowledge of the physical  character of that luminary, and the event is of such rare occurrence,  that the opportunity to study the phenomena should never . be  neglected. The Smithsonian Institution, therefore, readily agreed to  a proposition made by Lieutenant Gilliss, to undertake the observation   REPORT OF THE SP^CRETARY. 23  of the eclipse, if an appropriation could be made sufficient to pay at  least a portion of his expenses and his free passage procured. In  accordance with this proposition letters were addressed to the British  Pacific Steam Navigation Company, to the United States Mail Steam-  ship Company, to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and to the  Panama Railroad Company, setting forth the objects of the expe-  dition, and asking for free transportation for Lieutenant Gilliss and  his instruments, and for such other facilities as it might be in their  power to bestow. This request was generously complied with ; not  only were free passages granted to himself and his companion, but  every other facility was proffered which it was in the power of the  officers of the companies to afford.  The British Pacific Steam Navigation Company not only furnished  with great cordiality free transport, but so instructed their agents on  the coast, that when an accident on the Panama railroad separated  Lieutenant Gilliss from his instruments, and caused a delay in their  arrival, the steamer bound to Payta waited in port several hours for  them. When returning home, the commander of another steamer of  the same line was instructed to make all possible speed in reaching  Panama, so as to save Lieutenant Gilliss the detention of two weeks  which passengers coming to the United States from the South Pacific  frequently experience. For the acts of enlightened liberality on the  the part of the above-mentioned companies in facilitating the advance  of science, special acknowledgment by resolution immediately from the  Board of Regents is due.  The necessary meteorological instruments were furnished by the  Institution ; the astronomical by the National Observatory, the Coast  Survey, and Mr. Henry Fitz, of New York.  Lieutenant Gilliss, though highly favored with the necessary means  of accomplishing the desired result, encountered many difficulties in  reaching the proper spot at which to make the observations. Accom-  panied by Mr. C. H. Raymond, of New York, he arrived at Payta ^  Peru, on the 21st of August, 1858. The French admiral command-  ing in the Pacific placed the war steamer Megere at his disposition?  should it be desirable to proceed to any other point on the coast\"  Information, however, obtained from residents, and his own experience  during the ensuing eight days, convinced him that there was little  probability of a clear sky in the morning near the sea. But, in  order to obtain observations from a second party, should clear weather  occur there, he arranged with the commandant of the Megere to pro-   24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  ceed with the vessel to a point south, of Payta, where the eclipse would  be total, and furnished him with a telescope and a special chronometer  for the use of the officers selected to make the observations on shore.  The accounts of these gentlemen are embraced in the report of Lieu-  tenant Gilliss to the Institution.  Leaving Payta, on the morning of August 29, with such instruments  as it was possible to transport on mules across the desert in the northern  part of Peru^ Lieutenant Gilliss proceeded to Olmos, a small town  within the outer range of the Andes^ and in approximate latitude 6Â°  south, longitude 80Â° 10' west. Illness prevented his reaching the  summit of the Andes, as he intended, and on the 5th of September he  encamped on an eminence one mile southeast from Olmos, and almost  on the central line traversed by the moon's shadow. From August  21 until the day of the eclipse, there had been but two clear mornings.  On all the other days the sky was obscured until after 9 a. m.,  before which time the eclipse terminated. It was also cloudy at sun-  rise of the 7th, and until after the eclipse had commenced ; but as it  progressed the thin masses of vapor rapidly rolled from a portion  of the sky, and for some time before and after total obscuration only  a delicate film of mist intervened between the observer and the moon.  The observations, though unpromising at the beginning, were highly  successful.  The different astronomical phases of the eclipse were determined  with accuracy, and thus afford data for the improvement of the solar  and lunar tables. Interesting facts were also obtained in regard  to a phenomenon which has attracted much attention during later  eclipses, and is known under the name of the pink-colored protu-  berances or flame-like appearances projecting from the sun beyond  the limb of the moon. Simultaneously with the total obscuration of  the sun. Lieutenant Gilliss observed four marked protuberances of this  character beyond the lunar disk, one of them being more than 30Â° of  the sun's circumference in extent. Their elevation did not exceed V  or 1' 10\" of the celestial arc, the largest one being scarcely half that  altitude. They resembled clouds, the thinner portions of which trans-  mitted the sunlight, but were wholly destitute of the rose color hith-  erto observed in total solar eclipses, and seen on this occasion by  the French officers at Sechura bay. Those to the west and north  continued visible for one or two seconds after the sun's limb was  uncovered. These prominences were plainly visible to the unassisted  eye, and their proximate position and the absence of expected red color   EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25  were also noted by Mr. Raymond, who had been charged with the  meteorological observations. The total eclipse lasted 60^ seconds.  A corona light appeared at the same time as the solar clouds, extend-  ing from the sun farthest in radial lines drawn from the centre, and  passing through the clouds, but was nowhere traceable more than 15'  or 16' from the solar disk. There was no appearance of fasces or  bundles of rays, but only a uniformly diminishing and slightly orange  tinted light, whose brightness and extent were apparently influenced  by the film of mist. It vanished with the first appearance of the sun.  As already stated. Lieutenant Gilliss was accompanied by Mr. Car-  rington H. Raymond, of New York, who rendered him essential  assistance during the whole expedition, as well as at the time of the  eclipse.  The communication of Lieutenant Gilliss will be accompanied by a  drawing of the appearance of the eclipse at the time of greatest obscu-  ration, and will form a part of the eleventh volume of the Smith-  sonian Contributions.  5. The investigations of Mr. Meech relative to the heat and light of  the sun have been continued during the past year and are still in  progress. The memoir containing the result of these investigations  obtained previous to September, 1855, was published as a part of the  ninth volume of the Smithsonian Contributions, and has received the  approbation of the scientific world. It is noticed with credit to the  Institution in the proceedings of the Astronomical Society of London,  and in a letter on the subject from Sir John Herschel.  The memoir already published contains a discussion of solar heat  in all its astronomic phases at the exterior of the earth's atmosphere.  The labors of Mr. Meech have since been directed to the partial  absorption or extinction which the rays experience in passing through  the atmosphere to the earth's surface. The phenomenon is one of  special interest, and various instruments have been devised for its  measurement ; among which the pyrheliometer of Pouillet, and the  actinometer of Herschel, may be mentioned. The observations with  these instruments, says Mr. Meech, are certainly valuable and in-  structive, but, with one very doubtful exception, they fail to exhibit  any distinct law. The law of absorption not being obvious directly  from observation, the simjjle hypothesis has generally been adopted  that equal thicknesses or strata of the medium absorb equal pro-  portions of the light or heat incident upon each stratum. Lambert,  Laplace, Pouillet, and others, have expressed this assumption in an   26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  analytic form, wliicli applies very correctly at higher altitudes and  near the zenith. For low altitudes, Laplace combined the same assump-  tion with his theory of refraction, and derived an approximate expres-  sion for the relative amounts.  But the inquiry arises how far the fundamental assumption is sus-  tained by experiments. During the trigonometric survey of India,  the astronomer, Jacob, observed the extinction of light reflected  through an extent of sixty miles of horizontal atmosphere. His results  were found to correspond very nearly with the law that \"as the  first differences of distance increases in arithmetical progression, the  intensity of light diminishes in geometrical progression.\" The ex-  periments of Delaroche and Melloni also indicate that the hypothesis  of equal thicknesses absorbing equal portions of the incident heat, is  only an approximation, which, in extended media, will differ widely  from the truth ; indeed, their experiments show an increasing facility  of transmission through equal strata in the direction in which the  rays proceed.  The necessity of a change, therefore, in the theory of atmospheric ab-  sorption to render it conformable to such experiments being obvious, the  greater part of Mr. Meech's time available during the past year has  been devoted to this object. The remaining discussions relative to  the theory of climatic heat^ of which this forms a part, are yet in  progress. It may here be stated, however, that on computing by this  method the observations given in the translation of Kaemtz's Meteor-  ology, p. 150, Mr. Meech shows that out of 100 rays descending  vertically from the zenith, 22 rays are lost or absorbed in the atmo-  sphere, and 78 are transmitted to the earth's surface. The same pro-  cess applied to the mean of observations made with Herschel's actino-  meter on the Faulhorn and at Brientz, in Switzerland, leads to  precisely the same result when reduced to the sea level.  6. A proposition was made to the Institution in 1856 by Dr. James  Deane, of Greenfield, Massachusetts, to publish a memoir containing  a series of illustrations of his researches relative to the celebrated fossil  foot-prints in the sandstone of the Connecticut valley. It is now well  established that these foot-prints consist of impressions made by gigantic  birds and other animals, and were first brought to the attention of the  scientific world by the ardent and persevering efforts of Dr. Deane  and the critical investigations of Professor Hitchcock. The number  of plates required to illustrate the memoir, as originally proposed,  would have involved too great an expense to be met in one or even   EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27  two years liy the portion of the income of the Institution which  could be appropriated to any single publication. It was therefore con-  cluded that Dr. Deane should continue his investigations, and endeavor,  by means of photography, to produce representations of all the most  important specimens, and that from these a selection should be  made sufficient to illustrate the characteristics of the different  species of animals by which the impressions had been left. Dr. Deane  enthusiastically devoted all the time to this object that he could spare  from a laborious practice, on which the support of his family depended,  until his career was suddenly terminated by death. To assist in the  experiments of photography and in lithographing the illustrations a  small appropriation was made, with which about fifty drawings were  finished on stone by Dr. Deane himself. The work, however, is in  such an unfinished condition that it cannot be published unless some  person well acquainted with the subject will undertake the task of its  completion.  7. The Annual Report to Congress for the year 1857, together with  the appendix, forms a volume of 438 pages. Of this Report the Senate  ordered 10,000 and the House of Representatives 7,000 extra copies,  of which 5^,000 of the first and 2,000 of the latter were given to the  Institution for distribution. The volume was restricted in size to 440  pages, and the wood-cuts were furnished, as usual, at the expense of  the Smithsonian fund. The statement may be again repeated that the  Institution is not responsible for the quality of the paper, nor for all  the errors which may be found in the text, since the whole work is set  up by a large number of different compositors, and is driven through  the press without sufficient time being allowed for revision and proper  correction. The distribution, however, of the copies of the Reports  has done much to make the Institution favorably known throughout  the country. The applications for them are constantly increasing,  and even the number liberally furnished by Congress at its last session  has been found scarcely sufficient to supply the demand. They are pre-  sented to the meteorological observers, and to all libraries and educa-  tional establishments. Besides furnishing a kind of knowledge not  readily accessible through any other channel, these Reports serve to  gratify a laudable public desire for information as to the management  and operations of the Institution.  The important truth has now become known in every part of the  world, that the property of Smithson was not given for the support of  a local establishment, but in trust to the United States for the promo-   28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  tion of knowledge, for the discovery of new truths, and for the diffu-  sion of these among men ; that the honor of the government is pledged  for the faithful administration of the trust in accordance with the ex-  pressed will of the donor, and that consequently every intelligent  citizen is interested in all which relates to the administration of the  bequest.  8. The collection of the meteorological and physical tables prepared  for the Institution by Professor Guyot, has been stereotyped and the  first issue has been distributed to the meteorological observers and to  foreign institutions. It has been received by the scientific world with  warm acknowledgments and special commendation. The Institution  has not lost sight of the proposition mentioned in the Eeport for 1856,  to prepare other series of tables for facilitating scientific calculations,  and to present in a convenient form the \"Constants of Nature and  Art.\" In order, however, fully to realize all the good which will  result from this work, it may be necessary to solicit the aid of foreign  institutions; and we think it probable that the co-operation of the Brit-  ish Association, as well as that of some of the academies on the conti-  nent of Europe, may be secured.  9. Among the miscellaneous publications of the past year should be  mentioned a pamphlet, accompanied by a map of the solar eclipse of  March 15, 1858, with an account of an instrument by which the latter  was projected. This instrument was invented in 1842 by Rev. Thomas  Hill, has since been improved, and now affords a ready means of de-  lineating the general phases of an eclipse, as exhibited over a large  portion of the earth, with sufiicient accuracy for a first approximation.  It consequently saves much labor, and obviates, to a considerable  extent, the liability to larger errors in the numerical calculations.  The eclipse here mentioned was visible throughout Europe, Greenland,  and the North of Africa; also partly visible in the northern part of  South America and the eastern part of North America. The map exhib-  its the time of beginning and ending and the different phases of the  eclipse over the greater portion of North America in which there was  any probability of observations being made. Unfortunately, however,  the face of the sky in the United States on the day of the eclipse  was overcast, and few if any observations of value were obtained. The  projection of the map, however, illustrates the use of the ingenious  mechanical contrivance of Mr. Hill, and will serve to make it gene-  rally known to practical astronomers.  10. A new and revised edition of \"Directions for Meteorological Ob-  servations\" has been stereotyped and distributed. To the directions   EEPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 29  given in the first edition there have been added instructions for noting  periodical phenomena, earthquakes, auroras, &c.,and special remarks  suggested by the experience of previous years. This publication forms  an octavo pamphlet of seventy pages, and is now, perhaps, the most  convenient and complete work for the purpose to be found in the  English language.  The catalogue of the Dipterous Insects of North America, prepared  by Baron Ostensacken, described in the last Report, has been published.  It forms an octavo pamphlet of ninety-two pages, and constitutes a  portion of a series of works which will be alluded to in a subsequent  part of this Report.  11. It was mentioned in the last Report that the Institution had  subscribed for a few copies of a treatise on the Fossils of South Carolina,  which was commenced by Professors Tuomey and F. S. Holmes, and,  after the death of the former, continued by the latter. Copies of five  parts of the continuation have been received, and will be distributed  in exchange for other works of foreign authors of the same class. This  work has been patronized by the State, and is alike creditable to the  industry, talents, and knowledge of the author, the skill of the artist,  and the intelligent liberality of the government of South Carolina.  Another publication to which a subscription has been made is Peirce's  Analytic Mechanics. This is not an elementary compilation, but  consists principally of original solutions of many of the most important  problems of theoretical astronomy and pure physics. The author at  first offered to present this work as a series of memoirs to the Insti-  tution, but by means of the subscriptions which have been obtained  for it, the publication has since been undertaken by private enter-  prise. The copies subscribed for by the Institution will be distributed  to some of the first class learned societies in Europe^ and will doubt-  less be regarded as an important contribution of new truths, as well as  of methods of establishing some of those which have been previously  discovered, alike indicative of the genius of the author and of the en-  lightened and liberal appreciation of the country.  A subscription has also been made for a number of copies, for foreign  distribution, of the Mathematical Monthly, edited by J. D. Runkle, of  Cambridge, a journal intended to promote the study of mathematics  in this country. The plan and execution of this work are such as to  commend it to all who are interested in the advance of the important  branch of knowledge to which it pertains; and it is gratifying to learn  that the patronage which it has received, as well as the number and   30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  character of the articles furnished, are such as to insure its entire  success.  12. In accordance with the plan mentioned in the last Eeport of direct-  ing attention to departments of knowledge needing special stimulus, the  Institution has made arrangements for the preparation of a series of  works on the different orders of insects found in North America, with  a view of identifying the species and of systematizing the study of their  relations and habits. This is a subject not only of much scientific  interest, but also of great practical importance in regard to its con-  nexion with agriculture. When it is considered how much loss is  annually caused to this country by the ravages of the Hessian fly, the  army and cotton worms, the curculio, the grasshopper, and numerous  other species of insects, it must be evident that anything that may  tend in however slight a degree to throw light upon the means of pre-  venting such ravages is of great commercial importance. But  before we can make use of the experience of other countries on this  subject, it will be necessary to identify the insects, since, in regard to  them as well as other objects of natural history, the same name is  often popularly applied to widely different species.  The greatest deficiency in American natural history is to be found  in the department of entomology, there being no original treatise in  reference to this country applicable to the wants of the present day.  The Institution has therefore made arrangements with eminent ento-  mologists for the preparation of the following series of reports on the  different orders, in the form of systematiclists,of all the North American  species hitherto described, and an account of the different families and  genera, and, whenever practicable, of the species of each order :  Coleoptera, (Beetles, &c.,) by Dr. John L. Le Conte, Philadelphia.  Neuroptera, (Dragon flics, &c.,) by Dr. Hagen, Konigsberg.  Hymenoptera, (Wasps, bees, &c.,) by H. De Saussure, Geneva.  Diptera, (Flies, mosquitoes, &c.,) by Baron Ostensacken, of the  Russian legation at Washington.  Lepidoptera, (Butterflies, moths, &c.,) by Dr. J. Gr. Morris, Balti-  more, and by Dr. B. Clemens, Easton, Pa.  Hemiptera, (Chinches, roaches, &c.,) by P. R. Uhler, Baltimore.  Catalogues of the Coleoptera and Diptera have been already pub-  lished, while the descriptions of these orders by Dr. Le Conte and  Baron Ostensacken, and of the Neuroptera, by Dr. Hagen, are in an ad-   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31  vanced state of preparation. Moreover, it has been thouglit desi-  rable as introductions to these catalogues to give an account of the  best methods of capturing the insects and preserving them for the  cabinet as well as for breeding the larva3 with a view of studying the  habits and peculiarities of the species, and with this object arrange-  ments have been made with gentlemen particularly acquainted with  different orders lor articles relating to them.  A commencement has already been made in the preparation of mate-  rials for these works, a part of which will be given in an article to be  found in the appendix to this report.  The description of the method of capturing insects and preserving  them will be widely distributed, and it is to be hoped that the different  correspondents of the Institution interested in this branch of natural  history will assist in completing the collections.  Specimens of Neuroptera were lastyear referred to Dr. Hagen, consist-  ing chiefly of those collected by Captain Pope's expedition, in New  Mexico as well as by Baron Ostensacken in the Disti ict of Columbia  and elsewhere^ together with various series from other sources. Three-  fourths at least of all the specimens of the collection sent to Dr.  Hagen have never before been described. For example, among thirty-  four species of Odonata (dragon flies) twenty-seven were found to be new.  \" The materials for study which I have thus received from the Smith-  sonian Institution,\" says Dr. Hagen, \"are the richest I have ever ob-  tained at one time before.\"  Bleteorology . â€” The arrangement between the Patent Office and this  Institution in relation to the collection of meteorological statistics still  continues, and is, we think, producing good results. The number of  observers now reporting is about three hundred, and it is only in re-  gard to the want of persistency on the part of some of these that there  is room for the expression of regret. Incomplete and irregular records,  however, are of importance in furnishing data for tiie general in-  vestigation of the subject â€” an investigation which is based, as was  stated in a former report, upon the preparation of a series of maps of the  United tStates for each day in the year, on which are represented with  different colors the portions of the country over which the sky is clear,  cloudy, snowing, raining, &c., and, by arrows, the direction of the  wind. These maps indicate the place of commencement, the succes-  sive stages of development, the changes and the final disappearance of  storms. Any person, therefore, who may furnish a daily record of the  face of the sky, of the beginning and ending of rain, snow, hail, and   52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  storms, and the direction and intensity of the wind, (which can be  done without instruments,) will render valuable service in advancing  a knowledge of the laws of the atmospheric disturbances to which  we are constantly subjected^ and which exercise so important an in-  fluence on our health, comfort, and occupation. To induce persons to  furnish this simple but valuable information a blank form has been  prepared for more general distribution than the one required by those  who are provided with instruments. If sufficient data of this kind  could be obtained to complete a series of maps, comprising one for  each day in a single year, over the whole United States, the laws of  the general phenomena of our storms could be determined. For this  purpose observations are j^articularly desirable from regions west of  the Mississippi river, and every traveller over the plains would render  important service by making a record of the weather at least three  times a day, viz: at 7 a. m., 2 and 9 p. m., and transmitting a copy  to the Commissioner of Patents. The principles which have been  already determined in regard to the development and progress of  storms fully demonstrate the importance of the information to be de-  rived from daily telegraphic despatches as regards probable changes  of weather in the eastern portions of the United States. The Institu-  tion and the public generally are indebted to the Morse telegraph line  for the gratuitous reports which its operators have daily furnished.  An object of much interest at the Smithsonian building is a daily  exhibition on a large map of the condition of the weather over a con-  siderable portion of the United States. The reports are received about  ten o'clock in the morning, and the changes on the maps are made by  temporarily attaching to the several stations pieces of card of differ-  ent colors to denote different conditions of the weather as to clearness,  cloudiness, rain or snow. This map is not only of interest to visitors  in exhibiting the kind of weather which their friends at a distance are  experiencing, but is also of importance in determining at a glance the  probable changes which may soon be expected. It is to be hoped that  reports may hereafter be received from all parts of the country to  which telegraphic lines extend. The value of the information thus  received would be much enhanced if a brief record of the direction of  the wind and the indications of the thermometer were in all cases added.  At the last meeting of the American Association for the Advancement  of Science a committee was appointed, on motion of Major Lachlan, of  Cincinnati, to petition the several States of the Union and the govern-  ments of other portions of the continent to co-operate with the Smith-   EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33  sonian Institution and the Patent Office in establisliing systems of sta-  tions for observations furnished with standard instruments. Though  this committee, consisting of Major Lachlan, Dr. Hough, Professor  Coffin, and myself, have not had an opportunity of fully discussing  the several points to he recommended, yet it is thought they will  adopt the following suggestions, which have been considered and ap-  proved by a majority of the members :  1. That stations for observation be established not over sixty miles  apart.  2. That at each station the pressure, temperature, and humidity of  the air, the direction and velocity of the winds, (both upper and lower  currents,) and the kind and amount of cloudiness be observed three  times a day â€” at 7 o'clock a. m., 2 p. m., and 9 p. m. ; also the date  of the commencement and termination of each rain or snow, with the  amount of water that falls, and any other atmospheric phenomena that  the observer may deem of interest to note and record.  3. That each station be furnished with a barometer having a zero  adjustment, a pair of thermometers carefully compared with each  other throughout their entire range, and a rain-gage.  4. That a superintendent be appointed in each State, who shall  select the stations and instruments, secure reliable observers, keep  himself informed as to the condition of the instruments and observa-  tions, and report annually to the legislature of the State, and also to  the Smithsonian Institution.  5. That the superintendent be furnished with standard instruments  with which the others may be compared when necessary.  6. That these standard instruments be themselves compared with  some common standard.  *r. That each observer publish his observations monthly in some  neighboring newspaper, as an item of local interest, and have, per-  haps, five hundred extra slips of the same printed for exchange with  other observers ; these slips to be sent to the Smithsonian Institution  for distribution.  8. That monthly and annual abstracts of these observations be  published in a uniform style throughout the United States, and the  continent if possible; andthat,for the sake of securing such uniformity  as well as reducing the cost, they be prepared and published by the  Smithsonian Institution, each State contributing a sum sufficient to  defray the expense of its own observations ; and the whole being com-  bined in a single volume.  3   34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.  9. That eacL. State receive for distribution within its own limits a  number of copies of the above-mentioned volume of abstracts, equal to  perhaps twenty-five times the number of stations in the State: two for  the State library, six for each observer, one for each incorporated college  within the State, and the remainder to be distributed at the discretion  of the superintendent.  10. That to carry the foregoing provisions into effect, each State  appropriate per station $40 for the supply of instruments, and $36 a  year afterwards; the latter item to be distributed as follows, viz: $20  to each observer to pay for the printing and postage of the slips con-  taining his monthly observations, |5 per station to the superintendent  for his expenses, and $14 per station for preparing and publishing the  abstracts.  It gives me pleasure to state that a system of twenty-five stations for  minute and accurate observations, with standard instruments, has  been established along the northwestern lakes, under the direction  of Captain Meade, of the Topographical Engineers, U. S. A. The  records are to be made four times a day, and to be reported to the  bureau in charge of Colonel Abert, at Washington, and will thus be  accessible for investigation by the Institution. In this connexion, I  am also pleased to be able to state that the meteorological system con-  templated for some years past in Upper Canada has been actually  commenced, and that twelve stations have been established at the  senior county grammar schools, from most of which reports have been  received during the past year. Copies of these observations will be of  much value in enabling the Institution to extend the area now included  in the field of its meteorological investigations. The report relative  to this system presented to the Canadian legislature will be found in  the appendix. It is also proper to mention that Doctor Shumard,  State geologist, has established a system of stations, furnished with  standard instruments, at three important points in Texas. In this  he has followed the example of Professor Swallow, who instituted a  similar system in connexion with his geological survey of Missouri.  The reductions of all the observations which have been made under  the direction of the Institution and the Patent Ofiice are now com-  pleted, and will be printed as rapidly as the means necessary for the  purpose can be appropriated. A large number of maps have been  constructed for the investigation of storms, and considerable additions  have been made to the material previously collected relative to the  climate of this continent.   REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35  One of the most important operations with, which the Institution  has been connected during the past year is the construction of a map  to represent at one view the arable and forest land of the United States.  This work has been intrusted to Dr. J, Gr. Cooper, a young naturalist,  who has paid ])articular attention to botany, has been engaged in  government explorations in the western part of the United States, and  has critically examined all the authorities to be found on the subject.  The facts presented at once to the eye by this map are in striking  accordance with the deductions from the meteorological materials which  have been collected at this Institution, and serve to place in a clear  point of view, the connexion of climate with the natural productions  of different parts of the earth.  No appropriation has been made for the last two years for the pur-  chase and distribution of instruments other than rain-gages and ther-  mometers. The attempt to furnish barometers to important stations  at a distance has not been successful. In the majority of cases they  have been broken before they arrived at their place of destination, and  we find from experience that this instrument cannot be safely trans-  ported, except by hand or by water.  Magnetic Observatory. â€” From the date of the last report the declina-  tion needle of the magnetic observatory, established at the expense of  the Coast Survey and the Smithsonian fund, was in continued opera-  tion until October, 1858, when the introduction of a large iron pipe  for the supply of the grounds with the Potomac water made a new  adjustment of the apparatus necessary, and interrupted the continuity  of the record. Up to that time the remaining instruments had not  been received from London, though they were ordered by Professor  Bache before the erection of the building, several years ago. The  delay, we have since learned, was occasioned by death in the family of  the inventor, who had kindly undertaken to superintend their construc-  tion, and especially to make the adjustments for the compensation for  changes of temperature. The instruments have at length been re-  ceived, and will be put in operation early in the spring of the present  year. They were completed and forwarded under the direction of  Mr. Charles Brooke, the author of this ingenious and truly valuable  mode of automatic registration.  The importance of putting this observatory in full operation will be  manifest by a reference to a communication in the appendix to this  report from General Sabine to the Secretary, in which it is stated that  it is in contemplation to establish similar observatories at Pekin, the   36 EEPOET OF THE SECRETARY.  Falkland Isles, Newfoundland, and Vancouver's Island, and in whicli  tlie hope is expressed that the magnetic observatory on the Smithsonian  grounds may be in a condition to co-operate in the efforts that are thus  about to be made to determine the laws of the perturbations of the  intensity and direction of the magnetic force in a continuous belt en-  circling the globe.  Laboratory, â€” During the past year the laboratory has been under  the charge of Professor Shaeffer, late of the United States Patent Office,  and Dr. Craig, of this city. These gentlemen have reported to the  Institution on all articles of public interest which have been referred  to them for examination, and have made a series of investiga-  tions on a large number of specimens of guano, which were sub-  mitted to the Smithsonian Institution by the general government.  The policy adopted in regard to the specimens of various kinds referred  to the Institution for examination, is to furnish a report free of cost to  the parties making the reference, provided the information is of general  interest or immediately connected with the advance of science, but if  the examination is required principally to promote the interest of indi-  viduals or companies, a charge is made sufficient to cover the expense  of the investigation. By the adoption of this plan the laboratory is  kept in operation by means of a small appropriation for chemicals and  apparatus from the Smithsonian fund.  Exchange â€” The system of international exchanges continues to be  highly successful, and the amount of material transmitted abroad and  that received in return is constantly increasing. Few, if any, Ameri-  can Institutions publishing transactions or reports have any other  means of effecting exchanges with foreign societies, and although the  income of the Institution will not warrant a much greater extension of  this part of the operations, yet we trust that nothing will interfere to  lessen its present efficiency and usefulness.  It will be seen from the report of Professor Baird that during the  year there were 913 packages sent abroad by the Institution, weighing  22,674 pounds. The number of parcels received by the Institution from  other parties for foreign distribution was 4,425.  Library. â€” The fact has been repeatedly mentioned in preceding re-  ports that the principal object aimed at in the collection of the library  is to procure as perfect and extensive a series as possible of the trans-  actions and proceedings of all the learned societies which now exist  or have existed in diflferent parts of the world. It is to works of this  character that the student of science is obliged to refer for the minute   EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37  history of the progress of any special branch to which he may be de-  voted, and to ascertain accurately what has been published on his  particular subject previous to commencing his own labors, or at least  before he gives the results to the world, in order that he may do justice  to those who have preceded him in the same path, and have due re-  gard to his own reputation in not publishing facts and jirinciples as  new discoveries which have long since been recorded in the annals of  science.  Principally by means of the system of exchange, which has been  so successfully prosecuted by the Institution, the library is now richer  in this class of books than perhaps any other in the country, and  every year it is increasing in value, not only from the current publica-  tions of the various societies of the world, but by almost constant  additions of series and of volumes to complete sets which had before  been imperfect.  The value of this library to the country will be much enhanced,  first, by the publication of a list or catalogue of the different series  of transactions and proceedings of which it is now actually in pos-  session ; and secondly^ by a general index or list of titles of the various  memoirs or papers contained in the whole collection. The first of  these objects will soon be accomplished by a complete catalogue of  the whole collection, which has been prepared under the direction  of Professor W. W. Turner^ and is now in the press, and will be  distributed to all the correspondents of the Institution in the course  of a few months. This catalogue will not only serve to make known  to the men of science in this country what the library actually con-  tains in the line of transactions, but will also indicate to the foreign  contributors its deficiencies, and thus enable them, from their store  of duplicates, to complete imperfect sets, as well as to increase the  series.  The second desideratum is one which is felt as such by the whole  scientific and literary world, and it will be recollected that in the  report for 1855 I mentioned the fact that^ in behalf of this Insti-  tution, I had addressed a letter to the British Association, setting  forth the importance of the publication of a list of the titles of the  different memoirs or papers contained in all the transactions of the  learned societies of the world, and offering to co-operate in the im-  portant enterprise by furnishing a list of the contents of the volumes  of transactions and proceedings of the different societies of this country.  I am now much gratified in being able to inform the Board of Ptegents  that this proposition was favorably considered by the Association, and   38 EEPOET OF THE SECRETARY.  that the great work has actually been commenced at the expense and  under the direction of the Royal Society of London. It is estimated  that the whole number of titles will amount to 250,000, the cost of  printing which will probably exceed even the income of the endow-  ment of the Royal Society ; but the hope is entertained that other  institutions of Great Britain, as well as those of other countries, will  contribute towards defraying the expense.  At the last session of Congress a bill* passed the House of Repre-  sentatives in reference to the present copyright law, which was in ac-  cordance with the views presented in the several reports of the Board  of Regents.  The requirement that three copies of every original work secured by  copyright should be forwarded to Washington, to be deposited respect-  ively in the Libraries of Congress, the Department of State, and this  Institution, has been found as oppressive to the author, in the case of  valuable and costly works, as it was burdensome to the libraries in-  tended to be benefited, in the case of trifling and ephemeral ones.  The change in the law, by which this requirement will be in future  limited to the archives of the Interior Department at the Patent Office,  while it affords relief on the one hand, will on the other furnish ample  security in case of contested title ; and, being more easily and con-  stantly complied with, will insure to those who feel an interest in the  progress of American literature at least one entire and connected series  of these publications.  The additions to the library of the Smithsonian Institution by  exchange during 1858 have been large and important, the total being  considerably greater than in 1857. They consist of the following  items, viz: 553 octavo volumes, 156 quarto, 14 folio; also, 1,695 pam-  phlets and parts of volumes, and 122 charts and maps, making in all  2,540 ; being an excess of 780 volumes and parts of volumes over 1857.  Many of the receipts for the year consist of series of transactions of  societies more or less complete, tending to add greatly to the resources  of the library. Among these may be mentioned the Memoirs of the  Academic des Sciences of Dijon, 30 volumes; of the Haarlem Society  of Sciences, 41 volumes; of the Royal Netherlands Institute at Am-  sterdam, 14 volumes quarto; of the Academy of Sciences of Montpe-  lieij 9 volumes quarto; a full series of the publications of the Hydro-  * Since the date of this report, the bill referred to having passed the Senate also, has  become a law, and henceforth it will be requisite for the author to deposit only a single  copy with the clerk of the district court from whom the certificate of copyright is obtained.   EEPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 39  graphical Department of St. Petersburg, in many volumes; the charts  of the British Admiralty Board for the year; the AUgemeine Deutsche  Bibliothek, in 77 volumes, from the library at Cassel ; the Memoirs of  the Landwirthschaftliche Gesellschaft at Klagenfurt, in 14 quarto  volumes; and many others.  Alexander S. Taylor, esq., of Monterey, California, sent to the  Smithsonian Institution, for examination and use, a manuscript which  he had borrowed from the library of the Eight Rev. Bishop of Monterey;  and of which he gives the following account: \"This manuscript con-  taining 94 pages, is a vocabulary of the Mutsun tribe of California  Indians, living in the country around the mission of San Juan Bau-  tista, in Monterey county, and now nearly extinct. It was written in  1815, by P. Felipe Arroyo, an old missionary of great natural talents  and, as I am informed, very learned in the Indian languages of this  country. He died at the mission of Santa Inez about 1842.\" This  manuscript, on examination, proved of so interesting a character in its  relation to American philology and ethnography, that to afford to  American scholars opportunities for its study and to lessen the chances  of loss of the work, it was thought advisable to have it copied. This  accordingly has been done, the labor being performed by a Cuban  gentleman, under the supervision of Alexander J. Cotheal, esq., of  New York, who has added an English translation of some portions.  The number of pages in the transcript corresponds to those of the  original. The first seventy-seven pages, after the title and preface,  (which, as well as some of the explanatory matter, are in Latin,) are  occupied with a collection of Mutsun words and phrases, ranged some-  what irregularly, under the letters of the alphabet, accompanied by a  Spanish translation. The Indian words and phrases are written in  black, and the Spanish in red ink. The remaining pages contain  hymns, prayers, and catechetical exercises composed by the j)riests,  and some specimens of the music used in the native songs and dances.  The original, of course, has been returned, and the copy is placed in  the library of the Institution.  The extensive alterations in tlie wing of the building appropriated  to the library, mentioned in the last report, have been completed, and  the additions have been found not only of importance in the better  arrangement and accommodation of a larger number of books, but  also in increasing the general architectural effect of the apartment.   40 EEPOET OF THE SECEETART.  Museum. â€” The portion of the Smithsonian income which can he  devoted to a museum, and the $4,000 per annum appropriated hy  Congress, would not together he sufficient to establish and sustain a  general collection of specimens of the natural history of the world.  It will, therefore, he the policy of the Institution, unless other means  are provided, to confine the collections principally to illustrations of  the products of the North American continent. For this purpose  efforts have heen made, principally through the various exploring  expeditions, to ohtain a large number of specimens of all the species  of the different kingdoms of nature found in North America; and at  this time the collection under charge of the Institution is more exten-  sive in number and variety than any other which has ever before heen  made relative to this portion of the globe. It is not in accordance  with the general organization of the Institution to form a museum  of single specimens, interesting only for their rareness, but to collect  a large number of specimens of each species, particularly of such as  have not heen described, and to distribute these among the several  naturalists who may have the industry, ability, and the desire to study  them; the primary object of the Institution, namely, the increase of  the existing sum of knowledge in this case, as in all others, being  kept prominently in view.  The Institution has now become the curator of the collections of  natural history and ethnology of the government, and by law is  empowered, as it appears to me, to make the same disposition of the  materials contained in these collections as it does of those procured at  its own expense ; the design will be to render the specimens in  the greatest degree serviceable to the advance of knowledge. The  museum now consists of the following collections, of which, according  to Professor Baird, about one-fifth were brought from the Patent  Office :  First, those of the naval expeditions; second, those of the United  States geological surveys; third, those of the boundary surveys; fourth,  those of surveys for railroad routes to the Pacific; fifth, of miscellane-  ous expeditions under the War and Navy Departments; sixth, those  of miscellaneous collections presented or deposited by societies and  individuals; and, lastly, of an extensive series of the results of explora-  tions prosecuted hy the Institution itself. By far the greater portion  of the whole has been made under the stimulus and immediate direc-  tion of the Smithsonian Institution. A number of the special collec-  tions are still in the hands of those to whom they were intrusted for  scientific investigation and description. The arrangement of the cases   REPORT OF THE SECEETAEY. 41  and the disposition of the articles intended for public exhibition has  been a subject requiring considerable thought and experiment. It was  not only desirable to obtain the largest amount of space for the accom-  modation of the articles, but, also, to arrange the whole so as to har-  monize with the architectural embellishment of the large hall and  thus to produce a proper testhetical effect.  For a particular account of the present condition of the museum,  and for a detailed history of the several series of collections of which  it is composed, I beg leave to refer to the report of Professor Baird,  herewith annexed.  It is proper to add that the Institution continues to be under great  obligations to the steamer line to California via Panama (consisting of  the United States Mail Steamship Company, the Panama Kailroadand  the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,) for its most generous and  liberal aid in carrying packages between New York and the Pacific  coast free of all expense. The agents of the line, Mr. I, W. Kay-  mond in New York, and Mr. A. B. Forbes in San Francisco, have  also paid particular attention to the secure and certain transmission  of these parcels. When it is known that the aggregate amount trans-  ported for the Institution during the year has been not far from one  hundred packages, embracing valuable Natural History material, and  that merely the ordinary expenses of the transit would have been pro-  hibitory of the reception of most of them, some idea may be gathered  of the part taken by these companies in the development of the  Natural History of the west coast of America. Nor must it be for-  gotten that the packages carried free of charge by them contain not  only specimens of Natural History from the Pacific, but also large num-  bers of valuable books, presented by or through the Smithsonian Insti-  tution, to libraries in California, Oregon and Washington, thus adding  greatly to the literary and scientific resources of the west. Hearty  acknowledgments are also due for service of similar character to the  Pacific Steam Navigation Company, and to the Express Company of  Messrs. Wells, Fargo & Co. Mr. Banning, the government freight  contractor between Fort Tejon and Los Angelos, has also transported  several boxes free of charge.  Gallery of Art. â€” A large number of portraits, formerly in the  Patent Office, of Indian chiefs and a few females of the different tribes  which have from time to time visited Washington, which were painted  at the expense of government, has been added to the Gallery of Art.  These, with the Stanley paintings, now form perhaps the most   42 REPOET OF THE SECRETARY.  valuable collection in existence of illustrations of the features, cos-  tumes, and habits of the aborigines of this country.  This gallery is an object of special interest to all visitors to the  national metropolis, and to none more so than to the deputations of  Indians frequently called to Washington to transact business with  the government. A suggestion has been made that there be procured  photographic likenesses of individuals of these deputations, witli  which to increase the number of portraits. It would be a matter  regret were the collections ever to be separated, and it is hoped that  Congress will in due time purchase the portraits belonging to Mr.  Stanley, which will become more and more valuable in the progress  of the gradual extinction of the race of which they are such faithful  representations.  A number of busts of distinguished individuals, that formed a part  of the objects of art at the Patent Office, have also been transferred  to the Institution, and although these are not very choice illustrations  of sculpture, they serve as a beginning of a collection in this line  which may hereafter be worthy of the Institution.  Lectures. â€” Provision was made for the usual number of popular  lectures during the present season, and thus far they have been  attended by large audiences. This part of the operations of the Insti-  tution, though somewhat restricted in its elBfects to the city of Wash-  ington, has been of considerable importance in awakening a lively  interest in the welfare and operations of the Institution on the part of  a large number of intelligent and influential gentlemen, who have  been invited to lecture, from different and distant sections of the  United States. It has likewise been the means of presenting, through  the annual report, summaries of particular branches of science inter-  esting to the general reader and of value to the teacher of schools  and academies.  It will be recollected that the rooms in the second story of the  Smithsonian building are arranged for the accommodation of associa-  tions and conventions, of which the following have gladly availed  themselves during the past year of the facilities thus offered, namely :  The National Medical Association, the United States â€¢ Agricultural  Society, American Pharmaceutists' Association, the National Musical  Convention, the Art Association, and the American Colonization  Society. The Teachers' Association for the District of Columbia also  continues its monthly meetings in one of the apartments.  The influence the Institution is having on the character and repu-  tation of the city of Washington is by no means small. The free   EEPOKT OF THE SECEETARY. 43  lectures, it is evident, from the interest wliicli tliey still continue to  excite, must tend to promote the intelligence and morality of the citi-  zens, and the various scientific oj)erations which are carried on in  connexion with the Institution diversify the objects of interest to the  public generally in what pertains to the national metropolis. The  following is a list of the lectures delivered at the Institution during  the winter of 1858-59 :  Two lectures by Dr. John Rae, of Canada, on \"Arctic Explorations  and the Probable Fate of Sir John Franklin.\"  One lecture by J. G, Saxe, esq., of Vermont, on '* Poetry and  Poets.\"  One lecture by Professor G. W. Greene^ of New York, on \" The  Artistic Life of Thomas Crawford.\"  One lecture by Professor J. D. Dana, of Yale College, on \" Coral  Islands.\"  Two lectures by Thomas Clemson, esq., of Maryland, on \" Water \"  and \"Nitrogen.\"  Two lectures by Professor P. A. Chadbourne, of Williams College,  on \" Natural History as related to Intellect, Taste, and Wealth.\"  Four lectures by Rev. H. J. Comingo, of Ohio_, on \" Rome, its His-  torical Reminiscences ; its Antiquities and Ruins ; its Architectural  Monuments ; its Fine Arts.\"  Four lectures by Professor A. Casavell, of Brown University, on  \" The Magnitude and Figure of the Earth;\" \" The Law of Gravita-  tion;\" \" The Dimensions of the Solar System, or the Extent of our  Knowledge of Planetary Distances;\" and \"Sidereal Astronomy.\"  Five lectures by Professor J. P. Cook, of Harvard College, on  \"Atmospheric Air,\" \"Oxygen and Ozone,\" \"Nitrogen,\" \"Water,\"  \" Carbon,\" &c., &c.  The lectures of Professor Caswell will be inserted in the Appendix  to this report, and, it is believed, will be found interestiag to the  teacher, as well as to the general reader, on account of the informa-  tion given relative to many points not usually dwelt upon in popular  works on the subject.  Respectfully submitted.  JOSEPH HENRY.   APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The system of international exchanges organized by the Smith-  sonian Institution a few years ago continues to be highly successful,  and is rapidly developing to an enormous magnitude. Every year  witnesses a great increase in the amount of material transmitted  abroad and received in return, and it is not too much to say that any  abrupt termination of the undertaking on the part of the Institution  would be felt as a great public calamity. Few, if any, American  institutions of note, publishing transactions or reports, have any  other medium of exchanging them with foreign correspondents.  The details of operations in this department will be found in the  following tables, all of which exhibit a marked increase as compared  with 1857 :  A â€” Beceipt of books, dc, hy exchange in 1858.

Additions to the museum. â€” Independently of the collections of the  Patent Office, transferred in 1858, and of which a more detailed notice  will be found on another page, the additions to the Smithsonian  museum during 1858 have been of great magnitude and importance,  in many respects exceeding those of any previous year, occupying, as  they did, more than 200 boxes, 20 kegs or barrels, and numerous  single packages of greater or less size. It is impossible within my  present limits to mention the contents of these in detail, and a general  4   50 EEPOET OF ASSISTANT SECEETAKY.  statement at the end of this report is all that can be given for most of  them. A portion, however, of the collections received belong to pub-  lic or private explorations of such interest as to require a further  notice.  EXPLORATIONS UNDER THE WAR DEPARTMENT.  1. Exploration of the valley of the Platte river, especially of tlie L<mp  Forh, under Lieutenant Warren, U. 8. A. â€” This exploration was con-  ducted in 1857, but the collections (filling 21 boxes) did not reach  Washington until 1858. The chief features of the collections con-  sisted of the fossil remains of animals and plants, gathered by J)r.  Hay den, geologist of the expedition; but a large and valuable series  of recent species was also procured, embracing several new to science.  2. Exploration of the Colorado river of California, under Lieuttnant  J, C. Ives, JJ. S. A. â€” Dr. J. S. Newberry, geologist and botanist, Mr.  B. Mollhausen, artist and zoologist. Large collections were made in  all departments on the Colorado and across to Albuquerque.  o. Wagon road over the ^hth parallel, under Lieutenant Beale. â€” A  valuable geological collection was made by this party.  UNDER THE STATE DEPARTMENT.  4. Survey of the northivest boundary, under Archibald Camphell,  esq. â€” Dr. 0. B. Kennerly, surgeon and naturalist, George Gibbs,  geologist. The collections of animals and plants, minerals and fossils,  made on Puget Sound and on the boundary line, were very full.  UNDER THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.  5. Survey of the Atrato ship canal rotde of the Isthmus of Darien, by  Lieutenant Craven, U. S. N., and Lieutenant Michler, U. S. A. â€” The  natural history operations were conducted by Mr. Schott, assisted by  Wm. S. and Charles Wood, under the supervision of Lieutenant  Michler. A valuable collection of animals and plants of the Isthmus  was brought back by this party.  UNDER THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.  6. Wagon road construction through the South Pass, under Wm. M.  Magraw. â€” This expedition was fitted out in the spring of 1857, with  Dr. J. G. Cooper as surgeon, and Mr. C. Drexler as hospital steward  and taxidermist. Dr. Cooper returned to Washington before the be-  ginning of the year, bringing large collections with him. Mr. Drex-  ler continued with Mr. Magraw's party, and wintered on Wind river.  In March he crossed to Camp Scott, near Fort Bridger, where, re-  maining until June, he made a very extensive collection of birds,  illustrating very fully the ornithology of the Rocky mountain region,  and throwing much light on the geographical distribution of the  species. His success in this was mainly due to the protection and aid  .afforded by General A. E. Johnston, in command of the forces, by  whose direction every facility was afforded him.   REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 51   EXPLORATIONS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.  7. Exploration of the vicinity of Fort Tejon, California, Inj Mr.  John Xantus. â€” During the year 1858 a natural history exploration,  commenced in 1857, has been nearly completed by Mr. Xantus, while  connected with the military post at Fort Tejon, which, for extent and  thoroughness, has perhaps scarcely a parallel on our continent, con-  sidering the fact that it was made in about sixteen months by one  person, almost constantly occupied in official duties, and under  various discouragements. The collections of Mr. Xantus filled 24  large boxes, and included nearly 2,000 birds, 200 mammals, many  hundreds of birds' nests and their eggs, with large numbers of reptiles,  fishes, insects, plants, skulls, skeletons, &c., all in the highest condi-  tion of preparation and preservation, and furnishing such accurate and  detailed information of the zoology and botany of Fort Tejon as we  possess of but few other points in the United States. Mr. Xantus  also made copious notes of the habits and characters of the species,  with numerous drawings.  8. Other points on the toest coast. â€” Valuable collections from the  vicinity of Fort Umpqua, Oregon, have been received from Dr. Vol-  lum, Irom about San Diego, made by A. Cassidy, and from Monterey,  made by A. S. Taylor. A collection of shejls, &c., made by Captain  Stone in the Gulf of California, assisted by Mr. Sloat, has supplied  the first specimens ever received from that region, proving of great in-  terest. Mr. James Wayne has also furnished important collections  from the Columbia river.  9. liochy mountains. â€” A collection of birds from Cantonment Burg-  wyn, sent in by Dr. W. W. Anderson, has added a new species of  birds to our fauna. Interesting collections of mammals and birds  from Fort Massachusetts were also made and presented by Captain  A. W. Bowman and Dr. McKee. Captain Marcy, in collecting speci-  mens of the Lagopus leucurus, or white tailed ptarmigan, has added to  the fauna of the United States an interesting species of bird hitherto  only found in British America.  10. Other regions of North America. â€” Additional collections of the  animals of the Red River of the North have been received from Mr.  Donald Gunn, and of Texas, from Major G. H. Thomas. Mr. Thos.  E. Blackney, of Chicago, has contributed one of the few specimens of  whooping crane (Grus americana) found in collections. The collections  of Florida animals by Mr. Gustavus Wurdemann, made in continua-  tion of previous years, have been very valuable, adding, as they have  done, several new species of birds, reptiles, and invertebrates to our  fauna ; collections made in northern Wisconsin by Mr. Kennicott,  and in many other regions by contributors, mentioned in detail in the  alphabetical list at the end of this report, have also been of much  value.  11. Other parts of the loorld. â€” The exotic additions consist chiefly  of collections made in the Sandwich Islands by Mr. W. 11. Pease  and on the Isthmus of Panama by Captain J. M. Dow and the Rev.  Jos. Rowell.   52 EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.  12. Astronomical expedition to Peru. â€” The expedition to Peru, for  the purpose of observing the total eclipse of the sun of September,  1858, by Lieutenant Gilliss, United States navy, under tlie auspices  of the Smithsonian Institution, was accompanied by Mr. Carrington  Raymond, who made such collections of birds, reptiles, and fishes as  his time and opportunities would allow, and succeeded in obtaining  several species not previously in the collection.  Among the collections received during the year, not strictly made  by single expeditions or individuals, one presented by the Museum  d'Histoire Naturelle of Paris deserves especial mention. This consists  of the types of many of the genera of serpents described by M. Dumeril,  selected with special reference to American forms. A labelled collection  of land shells from Mr. Binney, and of rare eggs of North American  birds from Mr. John Krider, are also worthy of particular notice.  PRESENT CONDITION OF THE MUSEUM.  The museum of the Smithsonian Institution, as at present c )nstituted,  has been supplied with materials chiefly from the following sources :  First. The collections brought from the Patent Office, and made up  principally of the results of various explorations. They are as follows :  1. United States exploring expedition, under Captain Wilkes,  United States navy, 1838-1842. The collections made by this naval  expedition are supposed greatly to exceed those of any other of similar  character ever fitted out by a foreign government, no published  series of results comparing at all in magnitude with that issued under  the direction of the Joint Library Committee of Congress.*  The collections made embrace full series of the animals, plants,  minerals, and ethnological material of the regions visited, such as  the coasts of South America, the islands of the South Seas, &c.  2. Exploration of the Amazon and its tributaries, by Lieutenant  * The following reports relating to the operations and collections of the expedition have  been published or are in press, the text in quarto, the plates in folio :  1.

These consist chiefly of verte-  brate animals and ethnological material.  3. Exploration of the valley of Great Salt Lake, by Captain Stans-  bury, United States army. Collections in character much like the  last.  4. Exploration of the Zuiii and Colorado rivers by Captain Sitgreaves,  United States army, and the survey of the Creek Boundary by Cap-  tains J. C. Woodruff and Sitgreaves.  5. Presents made to the United States by the King of Siam and  other foreign governments, deposited by the State Department.  6. Collections of Commodore M. C. Perry, United States navy,  made while negotiating a treaty with Japan, and the presents to the  United States government tlirough him from the Japanese authorities.  7. Collections made by Dr. D. D. Owen in his United States geolo-  gical explorations in the west.  8. Collection of birds, &c., of British Guiana, from Eev. C. W.  Denison.  9. African curiosities, deposited by Rev, Dr. Gurley, in behalf of  the American Colonization Society.  10. Miscellaneous specimens belonging to the old Washington  Museum and deposited by Mr. John Varden.  11. Miscellaneous specimens, including paintings and statuary, from  different individuals, presented to or deposited in the national gallery,  12. Collection of Indian paintings from the War and Indian Depart-  ments.  In addition to the collections above enumerated, the old hall con-  tained numerous specimens of different kinds belonging to or deposited  in the care of the National Institute. These the Smithsonian Institution  offered to take charge of, subject to such future order as the National  Institute might make in regard to them, but the offer was declined at  the time by its authorities and the specimens were left in their places,  but afterwards concentrated in several of the old cases of the Patent  Office hall. As no supervision is now exercised over them it is much  to be feared that great injury will necessarily result to the more per-  ishable portions.  Second. The collections in the Smithsonian Institution belonging to  the United States, and deposited in pursuance of the act of incorpora-  tion, other than those mentioned, are as follows :  13. Collections of the United States geological survey made in Iowa,  Illinois, and Minnesota, under Dr. D. D. Owen.  14. Collections made on Lake Superior, by Messrs. Foster and  Whitney.  15. Collections made by Dr. Charles T. Jackson.  16. Collections made in Oregon and Washington Territories, by  Dr. J. Evans.  17. Collections of vertebrates and minerals of Chile, made by Lieu-  tenant J. M. Gilliss, U. S. N.  18.

General collections made by the Pacific railroad survey on the  partial route in California, under Lieutenant Williamson.  24. General collections made by the Pacific railroad survey on the  western end of the 32d parallel, under Lieutenant Parke.  25. General collections made by the Pacific railroad survey on the  eastern end of the same parallel, under Captain Pope.  26. General collections made by the Pacific railroad survey in Cali-  fornia and Oregon, under Lieutenant Williamson.  27. Collections made by Captain Pope while sinking artesian wells  on the Llano Estacado.  28. Collections made by the northwestern boundary survey, under  A. Campbell, esq.  29. Collections made in Paraguay, by Captain Page.  30. Collections made on the Isthmus of Darien, by Lieutenant  Michler, U. S. A.  31. Collections made by Lieutenant Bryan during two seasons spent  in constructing a wagon road from Fort Riley to Bridger's Pass.  32. Collections made on the Upper Missouri and Yellowstone, under  Lieutenant Warren.  33. Collections made on the Platte, by Lieutenant Warren.  34. Collections made on Red river, by Captain Marcy.  35. Collections made by the South Pass wagon-road expedition,  under W. M. Magraw.  36. Collections made during the exploration of the Colorado river,  under Lieutenant Ives.  For an account of the many private collections presented to the  Smithsonian Institution, reference must be made to the annual reports  of 1850 â€” 1857, and to another portion of the report for the present  year ; several, however, need special mention here on account of their  extent and value.  37. Collections made in northern Mexico^ by Dr. Berlandier, pur-  chased and presented by Lieutenant Couch, in addition to a similar  collection made by himself.  38. Collections made in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida, by Mr.  Gustavus Wurdemann.  39. Collections made on the Pacific coast, by Lieut. Trowbridge.  40. Collections made in Washington and Oregon Territories, by  Dr. George Suckley.  41. Collections made in Washington, California^ and Nebraska, by  Dr. J. G. Cooper.  42. Collections made at Petaluma, California, by Mr. E Samuels.  43. Collections made on the Upper Missouri, by Thaddeus Culbert-  son ; and others made by Dr. Hayden and Colonel A. J. Vaughan,  Indian agent for the Blackfeet.   REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 55  44. Collections made at Fort Tejon, Cal., by Mr, John Xantus.  45. Collections made in Wisconsin and Missouri, by Dr. P. R. Hoy.  46. Collections made in Wisconsin, by Eev. A. 0. Barry.  47. Collections made in Illinois and Minnesota, by Robert Ken-  nicott.  48. Collections made on the New England coast, by W. Stimpson.  49. Greneral collections, deposited by IS. F. Baird.  Together with very many others of greater or less note.  As the result of combining all tlie collections referred to in the  preceding notices, it may be said that the museum of the Smithsonian  Institution is entitled to no mean rank among similar establishments  elsewhere. It is certainly superior to any other in the United States  as a general collection, although in the specialities of exotic birds,  shells, fossils, and minerals it is surpassed by the Philadelphia Acad-  emy of Natural Sciences. The material is not even now wanting to  give it a first class position; only the means to properly determine,  arrange, and exhibit the collections already within the walls of the  Institution. With the enormous amount of duplicates of rare and  new species on hand, it will be possible, after the determinations have  been completed, to make additions by exchange to any conceivable  extent, almost without the expenditure of a single dollar in the way  of purchase. It must be remembered, too, that the collections in the  building have been made since 1850, (with the exception of most of  thosebrought from the Patent Office, which hardly form one-fifth part of  the whole museum,) and that the additions of the past year, independ-  ently of those just mentioned, have exceeded those of any previous  one.  There are many departments of natural history in which the collec-  tions of the Smithsonian Institution are believed to be superior to any  others extant, not merely to those of the United States. In all that  relates to North America, and perhaps to South America, also, it has  no equal anywhere. The collection of Crustacea of the world is said  to be superior even to that of the Paris museum; and the same may,  possibly, be said of the recent corals. And yet no special attempts  have been made to this end. With the general interest of Americans  in such subjects, nothing would be easier than to excite the zeal of  officers of the naval and mercantile marine, government officials  abroad, and travellers, to such a pitch as to yield vast results every  year. Unfortunately the Smithsonian Institution has neither space  for such extensive exotic collections nor funds to devote to their pre-  paration and arrangement, all the appropriation of Congress being  required for the preservation of the specimens belonging to the United  States, and for the arrangement and exhibition of the contemplated  North American mliseum. This latter it is proposed to make as com-  plete as possible, so as to exhibit to visitors from all parts of the Union  a full series of natural objects belonging to each State.  In view of the importance of having some one public museum, illus-  trating as fully as possible the natural history of the world, and  taking rank with those of London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and others,  and considering that so excellent a foundation has already been laid  by the collections now in the Smithsonian Institution, and the ease   56 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.  with which they may be augmented to any desirable extent, it is  earnestly to be hoped that the day is not far distant when the moderate  amount of funds necessary may be placed in the hands of this Insti-  tution.  It is, of course, impossible, in a few words, to give a detailed account  of the collections of the Smithsonian museum. This can only be sup-  plied by the descriptive catalogues of species and specimens already  published or now in course of preparation, after the plan of those of  the British museum. These will serve not only as guides to the cases  and collections, but as manuals by which the same species may be  readily identified elsewhere.  Worh done in connexion ivith the collections.  The chief labor of the year in reference to the museum has con-  sisted in the transfer and partial arrangement of the collections  belonging to the United States, for many years constituting the  national gallery of the Patent Office, at first under the direction of  the Joint Committee of the Library of Congress, but for some years  under that of the Commissioner of Patents.  In the spring of 1857 the appropriation was made by Congress for  the construction of cases in the Smithsonian building for the reception  of the Patent Office collections, but owing to various drawbacks these  cases were not entirely finished until 1858. As soon as the various  technicalities incident to the transfer of this property were completed,  the work of removal was commenced and the whole collection moved  over in July last. Since that time much has been accomplished  towards giving to the different portions of the collections thus trans-  ferred their final arrangement^ but much necessarily remains to be  done before this can be completed. An indispensable preliminary  consists in the entry of every specimen in its appropriate record book  and the ineffaceable attachment of a number, by means of which the  displacement or loss of a label (so likely to occur in the operations of  a large and growing museum) will be of comparatively little conse-  quence. The next step is to post all the specimens of each species on  its appropriate invoice sheet, as fast as accurate identification is  accomplished, and after these sheets are systematically assorted the  final arrangement of the specimens themselves can then be completed  and catalogues printed as guides to the collection.  As none of these details had been entered into with regard to the  Patent Office collections previous to their removal, (with the exception  of the labelling of a portion, and the entry of the Crustacea in a  record book,) it becomes necessary to carry them out in the Smith-  sonian Institution. This, however, will require a long time to com-  plete, owing to the magnitude of the undertaking, and in the mean time  the specimens exhibited have been provisionally arranged for the  present, to be systematically placed and accurately and legibly labelled  hereafter. This has already been done by Mr. Varden for the ethno-  logical collections in the galleries of the west end of the hall, and by  Professor Dana for the corals.   REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.   57   Considerable progress has been made in recording, determining,  and invoicing the other collections in the Institution, apart from those  brought from the Patent Office. The mammals, North American  birds and their eggs, the osteological collection, and the North Ameri-  can lizards, are at present so well posted up that the number of species  represented in the different series, with the aggregate number in each  series, the locality, donor, and other incidents of all the specimens of  each can be shown at a glance. Nearly all the North American  reptiles, other than saurians, are entered, and many of them deter-  mined ; and the same may be said of the western fishes. The follow-  ing table will show how much of this labor of recording has been  done in 1858.

As  most of these, however, have been made at least twice in the record  book and on the invoices, the total is nearer 18,000.  From the preceding table it will be seen that the entries already  exceed twenty-five thousand. In the case of alcoholic series, how-  ever, each bottle, though containing only one species from one locality,  may, and almost always does, include more than one specimen, the  average being at least five, which would give to the reptiles and fishes  an addition of 22,024 pieces, which would bring the number of regis-  tered specimens nearly to forty-eight thousand. This is, lioweverj  far from expressing the full statistics of the collection, as there are  at least ten thousand jars of alcoholic specimens not yet entered, to  say nothing of the exotic birds and other objects.  During the year the determination of the North American birds in  the (Smithsonian collection has been completed, and the results pre-  sented by myself in the ninth volume of the reports of the Pacific  railroad survey, occupying over a thousand quarto pages. The de-  scription of each species is followed by a list of all the specimens in  the collection, with an indication of the locality, collector, date, and  other details, and the report in question thus serves as a catalogue of  the ornithological collections of the Institution, as the previous volume  (eighth) did of its North American mammals. From this report it   58 EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.  will he seen that the number of known North American species of  birds amounts to nearly 720^ or about 225 more than given in 1844  by Mr. Audubon, and that nearly all are in the Smithsonian collection.  The North American eggs and nests have been determined and  arranged in the hall, where they form a highly attractive feature.  The North American saurians have also been monographed and  described in detail to the number of about 90 species. This work is  still in manuscript. Much progress has also been made in a similar  memoir on the serpents, with the assistance of Mr. Kennicott.  Detailed accounts of the fishes coKected by the Mexican boundary and  Pacific railroad surveys, as also of the reptiles of the United States  exploring expedition, prepared by Dr. Girard, have been published  in their several reports.  Other collections belonging to the Smithsonian museum, in process  of elaboration during the year, are as follows :  Birds. â€” The report of Mr. Cassin on the birds of the United States  exploring expedition has been printed during the year. The same  gentleman has now the birds collected by Captain Page in Paraguay,  and those of the North Pacific expedition, and has nearly completed  rei)orts upon them.  Bej'ytiles. â€” The collection of North American turtles was placed some  years ago in the hands of Professor Agassiz, from whom a detailed  account of them may shortly be expected. Dr. Hallowell has furnished  during the year a report on the reptiles of the North Pacific expedition.  Fishes. â€” The fishes of the United States exploring expedition are in  the hands of Professor Agassiz for the preparation of a report, to be  published in the series of the expedition. The collection contains  many hundreds of new species. The fishes collected during the North  Pacific surveying and exploring expedition, under Captains Ringgold  and Rodgers, are in the hands of Mr. J. C. Brevoort.  Invertebrates. â€” Mr. Stimpson has been occupied during the year in  investigating the Crustacea collected by him on the North Pacific  exploring expedition. Dr. A. A. Gould has also had in hand the  shells, and Mr. Barnard the echini of the same expedition. The  Neuroptera of the Smithsonian museum are in progress of examina-  tion by Dr. Hagen, of Konigsberg, the Coleoptera by Dr. Le Conte,  the Hymenoptera by Mr. De Saussure, the Diptera by Baron Osten-  sacken, the Hemiptera by Mr. Uhler.  t Plants. â€” Large collections of plants collected by government expedi-  tions are still iu the hands of Drs. Torrey and Gray, Mr. SuUivant,  Mr. Curtis, and others.  Geological Collections. â€” The collections made during Lieutenant  Warren's explorations of the Upper Missouri region have been in  progress of investigation during the year by Messrs. Hayden and Meek,  and those of Lieutenant Ives' expedition to the Colorado by Dr. New-  berry.  Besides the scientific details connected witli the administration  of the Smithsonian museum and collections, much has been done  in regard to the mechanical portion, in addition to the more or less*  complete arrangement of the Patent Office series. A beginning has  been made in the cleaning of the mounted animals belonging to the   EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETAEY. 59  Patent Office collection, which had become greasy, dusty, or distorted,  by time and accident, and by their transfer to new stands. Many  skins of mammals and birds have been mounted and placed in the  cases to supply deficiencies, or to replace defective specimens, although  a vast amount yet remains to be accomplished in this respect before  the collection will attain its proper condition. A large number of  skulls have been cleaned and put in place ; nearly all the jars of  alcoholic specimens in the building, amounting to over 15,000, have  been washed and replaced with fresh spirits ; more than 1,000 gallons  of alcohol having been required for this purpose.  Distribution of Collections.  As the collections of the Smithsonian Institution become properly  indentified the duplicates are laid aside to be distributed to other  parties. It would, of course, be manifestly inexpedient to make such  distribution before determining the species accurately, as nearly all  are referred to in some official report or special monograph, and the  duplicates will be chiefly valuable as the types of such works. For  this reason not much has yet been done in the way of distribution to  public museums, although materials are constantly being furnished to  men of science for monographic investigations.  Even after the species may have been determined some time must  elapse before any extensive systematic distribution of series can be  effected, as the labor of labelling each specimen, making duplicate  catalogues, and of packing, will be very great. No time will be lost,  however, in doing whatever is possible in the case, not only for the  purpose of supplying a great want, but also of relieving the shelves  and cases of the Institution of a redundancy of material.

The estimated income for the year 1858, inclusive of the balance in  the hands of the treasurer, was $38,326 14, and the actual income  was the same, no change having taken place in the amount received  from the interest on the extra fund.  The estimated expenditure was $37,000. The actual expenditure  was $32,498. This diiference, which is nearly $4,500, has been  saved principally on the building, transportation, and the payment of  assistants.  The last mentioned item has been somewhat diminished by the pay-  ment from the appropriation of Congress for the keeping of the  museum of the exploring expeditions which has been transferred from  the Patent Office to the Smithsonian Institution. The amount re-  ceived for the last six months on this account has been about $2,000.  This sum is not credited to the Institution, because the money is dis-  bursed by the Secretary of the Interior.  The amount of income above that of the expenditure was $5,828 12.  This sum has been saved with the view of carrying out the design  mentioned in the last report, namely, that of accumulating a suffi-  cient sum in the treasury to enable the payment of cash for all pur-  poses, and thus to save the extra charge which, in almost all cases, is  made when payment is deferred.  The amount in the treasury at the beginning of the present year for  carrying on the operations until the time of receiving the next income  was $10,169 42. Of this, however, $5,000 belong to the extra fund,  which has not yet been invested. According to the statement of the  secretary, the Institution, at the beginning of 1859, had no outstand-  ing debts, and hence it appears that the funds are in a good condition.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS   BOARD OF REGENTS   THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION   Washington, January 19, 1859.  In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the  Smithsonian Institution, fixing the time of the beginning of their  annual meeting on the third Wednesday of January of each year,,  the Board met this day in the Regents' room.  Present : Hon. S. A. Douglas, Hon. William H. English, Hon.  James G. Berret, Professor A. D. Bache, Hon. W. AV. Seaton,.  Treasurer, and the Secretary.  The Secretary stated that letters had been received from Hon.  Richard Rush, Hon. Gideon Hawley, and Professor 0. C. Felton,  stating their iaability to attend the present annual session of the  Board of Regents.  The Treasurer presented a statement of the receipts and expendi-  tures during the year 1858, and also a general statement of the funds ;  which were referred to the executive committee.  A quorum not being present, the Board adjourned to meet at the  call of the Secretary.  Tuesday, February 15, 1859.  A meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,  was held this day at 11 a. m., in the Vice President's Room, United  States Capitol.  Present: Hon. John C. Breckinridge, Hon. James M. Mason^  Hon. James A. Pearce, Hon. S. A. Douglas, Hon. William H.  English, Hon. L. J. Gartrell, Hon. J. G. Berret, Professor A. D.

The Secretary announced the re-election by joint resolution of the  Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, of Profes-  sor Alexander Dallas Bache and Hon. George E. Badger, as Regents  of the Smithsonian Institution, for the term of six years.  The Secretary then presented the annual report of the operations of  the Institution for 1858, which was accepted.  The report of the Executive Committee, presented by Mr. Pearce,  was read and accepted.  The following letter was read to the Board.  Bremen Legation,  JVasJimgton, January 25, 1859.  Sir : Agreeably to your verbal request, I have proposed to the  president and directors of the North German Lloyd of Bremen, to  manifest their interest in the cause of science, by facilitating literary  intercourse between the United States and Germany, by means of  their steamers plying between Bremen and New York.  It affords me great pleasure now to iaform you that, according to  a letter of the president of the Lloyd, dated the 5th instant, and just  received, the said Bremen steamship company have resolved, hence-  forth, and until further notice, to forward by their steamers all the  packages of books and specimens of natural history which the  Smithsonian Institution may be pleased to send to Germany, or which  may be sent from Germany to the Smithsonian Institution, free of  charges hetiueen Neiv York and Bremenhaven.  I beg leave to add that Messrs. Gelpcke, Keutgen and Reichelt, 84  Broadway _, New York, are the agents of the North German Lloyd at  that place, and that the next Bremen steamer sailing for Europe will  leave New York on the 19th of February next.  I avail myself of this occasion to offer you renewed assurances of  my high consideration.  R. SCHLEIDEN,  Minister llesident of Bremen,  Professor Joseph Henry,  Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.  On motion of Mr. Mason, the following resolution was adopted by  the Board.  Resolved, That the thanks of this board be returned to his excel-  lency, R. Schleiden, minister resident of Bremen, for his interven-  tion with the \"North German Lloyd of Bremen\" to facilitate and  advance the cause of science by transporting, free of charge &rc.,  packages of books, and specimens of natural history, from Germany   80 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  to the Smithsonian Institution, and from the Institution to Germany,  and the like thanks to the president and directors of the North Grer-  man Lloyd of Bremen, for their generous liberality in the instance  above referred to.  The Secretary stated that thanks were due to several companies for  their liberality to Lieutenant Gilliss, who had visited South America  in September last, to make observations of the eclipse, under the  auspices of the Smithsonian Institution.  On motion of Mr. Mason, the following resolution was adopted:  Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Eegents are hereby  given to the British Pacific Steamship Navigation Company ; the  United States Mail Steamship Company; the Pacific Mail Steamship  Company ; and the Panama Railroad Company, for their generous  aid in the cause of science, by transporting free of charge, with other  facilites, extended to Lieutenant Gilliss, U. S. N., in his late ex-  pedition to Peru, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution,  to observe in that country the total solar eclipse of September 7, 1858.  Communications were read from Rev. F. Vinton, of Brooklyn,  relative to the Wynn estate, of which he is one of the two executors ;  from Hon. J. H. Hammond, and J. R. Lambdin, esq., relative to  procuring copies of celebrated works of art in Europe.  On motion of Mr. Douglas, the following resolution was adopted:  Resolved^ That the sum of two thousand dollars be appropriated, to  be expended at the discretion of the executive committee, for procur-  ing castmgs, or moulds for castings, of the chef d'oeuvres, of art in  Europe.  A communication from Professor S. F. Baird, asking an increase  of salary, was read, and referred to the executive committee.  A communication from Professor S. F. Morse, dated Paris, October  16, 1858, and a letter from Hon. Amos Kendall, were presented to the  Board, and both were referred to the special committee, which had  made a report in relation to the telegraph at the meeting of May 19,  1858.   The following communication was presented.  13 Ashley Place,  London, January 8, 1859,  My Dear Sir : I sent you from Leeds, in September, a printed copy  of the report of the joint committee of the Royal Society and the  British Association, on the subject of the continuance of magnetic ob-  servations drawn up by Sir John Herschel. You will have been ap-   PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGEJ^iTS. 81  prised by it of the serious purpose entertained in this country to  prosecute the magnetic researches which have already, though quite  in their infancy, established so many important laws. The minutes  of the last meeting of tlie council of the British Association, will make  you acquainted with our subsequent proceedings.  Our government has postponed the decision of the precise measures  to be taken until next year ; and indeed our preparations, both of in-  struments and observers, could scarcely have been ready earlier, but  I think that we may entertain very sanguine hopes of establishing  some observatories at least ; and I have the more confident expecta-  tion of this from the letter of the Prince Consort of December 11,  (which you will see in the enclosed minutes,) who is to be our presi-  dent next year, (at the B. A.,) and who will then be the medium of  our communications with government. But still we may derive  great support from any evidence which we may be able to adduce that  other countries besides our own participate in the scientific interest of  these researches, and it is specially in this view that I now write to  you  Our government appears not indisposed to have an observatory at  Pekin, and we shall no doubt press strongly to have a second at Van-  couver's Island. Toronto is already a third observatory in action in  nearly the same latitude, and London a fourth. It is obvious that a  chain of stations at moderate distances from each other in the middle  latitudes of the one hemisphere would give us a very reasonable  prospect of establishing with confidence laws the existence of which  we can now only infer. The greatest interval is between London  and Pekin, but this I have some reason to hope may be supplied by  an observatory at Kazan, under the able direction of Professor Bol-  zani, and it is impossible under these circumstances not to desire that  the observatory which you have so long meditated at Washington,  should be brought into corresponding activity.  It is purposed that the instruments for the new British observa-  tories should serve either for eye observations or for a continuous  record of the three elements. They will be in great measure on the  model of the self-recording instruments at Kew, which have now been  at work for a twelvemonth, and which seem indeed to leave little to  be desired. But those for the colonial observatories will be somewhat  differently arranged, so as to occupy a space not exceeding perhaps  twelve feet by six, and to have all their parts so attached to a solid  floor that nothing is capable of misplacement. We find at Kew  that two persons are sufficient for the manipulations of such an obser-  vatory, the preparation of the j)aper, &c., and the tabulation from the  traces by instrumental measurement at hourly intervals.  The instruments for the first either colonial or extra English ob-  servatory are in hand, and will be at work we expect in a temporary  building in the grounds of the observatory at Kew in July or August  next, where, should you incline to come once more to our British As-  sociation meeting, which is to be held this year at Aberdeen, under  the Prince Consort, or should any friend do so in whose judgment you  can confide, there will be a full opportunity for examining them.   82 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.  I cannot conclude this letter without again adverting to the sup-  port which we should derive in our communications with our govern-  ment in the event of the Smithsonian Institution concurring with us  in the importance of prosecuting these inquiries, and being disposed  to adopt corresponding proceedings with, of course, such modifications  as may suit either their convenience or their views of the subject.  Believe me, my dear sir, sincerely yours,  EDWARD SABINE.  Professor Henry.  The above communication was referred to the secretary and execu-  tive committee.  The Secretary presented a communication from G. J, Durand, of  Bordeaux, accompanied by a report on the history, operations, and  publications of the Smithsonian Institution, which that gentleman  had presented to the Imperial Academy of Bordeaux.  The board then adjourned sine die.   GENERAL APPENDIX   TO THE   REPORT FOR 1858.   The object of this Appendix is to illustrate the operations of the  Institution by the reports of lectures and extracts from correspond-  ence, as well as to furnish information of a character suited especially  to the meteorological observers and other persons interested in the  promotion of knowledge.   LECTUMS  ON ASTRONOMY   BY PROFESSOR A. CASWELL, OF BROWN UNIVERSITY.   1 . The figure and magnitude of the earth.  Every person who ventures to address a public assembly is supposed  to have something to present to them which is worthy of their atten-  tion, and which they can understand. In the treatment of scientific  subjects he must occupy himself mainly in giving information respect-  ing the facts and methods and laws of science.  In appearing before you this evening I may be permitted, I trust,  â– without arrogance on my part or disparagement to you, to say that  my object is instruction. Any object lower than this would ill become  this place and the character of this noble Institution, which is doing  so much to stimulate investigation and develop the scientific resources  of our country. I wish to unfold to you the elementary methods by  which the astronomer advances step by step in investigation, until he  spans the heavens with his measuring rod and weighs the far oiF  planetary bodies as in a balance, and marks the point in the starry  concave where the flaming comet will disappear in the depths of ether,  and that other point with almost equal precision where it will reap-  pear after the flight of centuries. There are in astronomy refinements  of method, both practical and theoretical, which can be appreciated only  by rare gifts and profound study. But the elementary methods are  quite within the reach of ordinary minds. The law_, which it was dif-  ficult to discover, may be very easily understood and its results readily  traced. It might require a Newton or a La Place to unveil the me-  chanism ot the heavens, but when that is once done every beholder  may watch the wonderful evolutions.  To accomplish the purposes I liave in view, I must first of all secure  your attention. For this I rely more upon the inherent interest and  grandeur of the subject than upon any adventitious attractions which  I may be able to throw around it.  Astronomy has long claimed the pre-eminence of being the most  ancient and the most perfect of the sciences. And yet astronomy, in  some of its aspects, is a rapidly progressive and cumulative science.   86 LECTURES  The number of primary planets known to astronomers \"has been  quadrupled within the last few years. Instead of the five planets  known to Ptolemy and Copernicus, and even to Newton, we now have  upwards of sixty. Scarcely a month passes that does not add some-  thing to the aggregate of our knowledge of the heavens â€” that does  not reveal some new wonder to the telescope, or disclose some new  treasure to the far-reaching analysis of the mathematician. Never  could it be said with a profounder meaning than now that \" the hea-  vens declare the glory of God.\"  The mechanism of the heavens, in proportion as we comprehend  more and more of its vastness and seeming complexity, bears witness  to the enduring order and harmony of the universe, and points with  unerring certainty to the superintending agency of an intelligent and  infinite -creator.  In the course of our discussions we shall have occasion not only to  state the results of investigation, but to witness the struggles and  triumphs of the human mind in working its way to the solution of  some of the great problems of science.  We spontaneously pay the tribute of our homage to all great  achievements. But in no case is homage more just or more enduring  than that which all cultivated minds pay to him who stands as the  minister and interpreter of Nature, and makes known to us her laws  and her mysteries. Many such adorn the annals of astronomy.  But I must not, in these preliminary remarks, encroach upon the  time which belongs to the special subject of the evening, which is â€”  Tlie figure and magnitude of the earth.  This may be called the great problem of astronomy. Its import-  ance is apparent from this, that the radius of the earth is the unit of  measure â€” I may say the measuring rod â€” which we are compelled to  use in determining the dimensions of the solar system. Whatever  error obtains in our knowledge of this will be repeated and multiplied  in all our estimates of jjlanetary distances. Hence the importance  which attaches to this problem, and the great pains which has been  taken to solve it with the utmost accuracy.  That the general figure of the earth is spherical was an opinion held  by many of the ancient astronomers. This was obvious from the  manner in which vesfecls disappear at sea. It was also indicated by the  circular shadow of the earth upon the moon in the case of eclipses.  In contemplating the extent of countries, and the distance of one  country from another, the question of the earth's magnitude would nat-  urally â€” almost necessarily, be suggested. It would be useless to  attempt to trace the successive steps in the progress of this inquiry  among the ancients. Aristotle relates that the mathematicians prior  to his time had found the circumference of the earth to be 400,000  stadia. But the length of the Grreek stadium is unknown, so also is  the method by which this result was obtained. The fact mentioned  by Aristotle is only of interest as showing that the question had en-   ON AbTSONOMY. 87  gaged the attention of astronomers at a very early period. Eratos-  thenes, of Alexandria, appears to have been the first to form a true  conception of the method by which the problem could be solved; that  is, by the measurement of an arc of the terrestrial meridian. Nearly  three centuries (276 years) before the Christian era, by such rude  methods as were then in use, he determined the distance from Alex-  andria to fSyene in upper Egypt to be ii of the whole circumference  of the earth. From the measured distance between the two cities he  computed the circumference of the earth to be 250,000 stadia. Some-  what later Posidonius, also of the Alexandrine school, resurned the  inquiry and gave as the result of his measurements 240,000 stadia.  But the uncertainty in the length of the stadium renders these results  of little value.  Nearly a thousand years later, (A. D. 814,) when the schools of sci-  ence had been transferred from Egypt and Greece to the banks of the  Euphrates, the caliph Almamoun, of Bagdad, directed his astrono-  mers to measure a degree of the meridian on the plains of Mesopota-  mia, with a view to determine the problem of the earth's magnitude.  Their result was so nearly coincident with that given by Ptolemy that  suspicion was cast upon the genuineness and fidelity of the measure-  ments.  After this period the inquiry seems hardly to have awakened any  attention for seven or eight centuries, when it was taken up by modern  European astronomers.  Before adverting to the more recent geodetic operations , as they are  termed, which have given us the exact figure and magnitude of the  earth, I may, perhaps, with advantage point out the general method  of executing those operations and the manner in which we deduce  from them the exact dimensions of the earth.  The geodetic operations to which I refer have for their object the  measurement of arcs on the earth's surface and chiefly arcs of the  meridian. There are other observations and experiments subsidiary  to the solution of this problem, to which I shall merely advert in  passing. Thus, for instance, the law of attraction for a spheroid  having been established, the vibrations of the pendulum in different  latitudes will furnish data from which the figure, not the magnitude,  of the earth can be determined. Many thousands of pendulum ex-  periments have been made in different parts of the earth with this  object in view. There are also certain inequalities in the moon's  motion, which are produced by the oblate or flattened figure of the  earth. These observed inequalities become in the hands of the mathe-  matical astronomer an accurate measure of that oblateuess. The  results obtained by La Place and others by this method are received  with great confidence by the most eminent astronomers. We shall refer  to the results obtained by both these methods, which assign the figure  only, when we have ex})lained the method of finding both the figure  and also the magnitude by the measurements of arcs of the meridian.  The measurement of a meridian line consists of three distinct pro-  cesses :  1. The line must be run in true north and south direction.   88   LECTURES   2. The difference of latitude at its extremities, or what is the same  thing, the angle made between the plumb-lines, must be determined.  3. The length of the arc in miles, or parts of miles, must be deter-  mined.  By the aid of a few simple diagrams I can readily indicate to you  how these results are obtained.  1. To run a true north and south line we have only to direct the  telescope of a transit instrument on a theodolite to the north star when  it is directly above or heloio the pole, and then, the axis being hori-  zontal, sight to some well defined object situated to the north and to  another at the south. The line passing through these points and con-  tinued by sighting to new objects will be the line required. The  time, which occurs twice in every twenty-four hours, when the north  star is so situated, is easily known from the Nautical Almanac. This  is the readiest method of fixing the line. But if the Nautical Almanac  is not on hand, the same result is obtained by so placing the instru-  ment that the time between the upper and lower transits of a circum-  polar star passing through the western portion of its revolution shall  be the same as that in passing from the lower transit through the  eastern portion of its revolution to the upper.  2. To find the angle made be-  tween the plumb-line, let a and  5, fig. 1, represent the arc of the  meridian ; C the centre of the  earth ; Z and Z' the zeniths of  the two extremities of the line.  It is required to find the angle  a G h. This will be the diff'er-  ence in latitude between the two  stations. But it is most easily  obtained by observing the zenith  distance of any star in the vicinity  of the zenith as it passes the me-  ridian. Thus Z a s' would be the  zenith distance of the star at a,  and Z' h s' the zenith distance at l. The difference between these  two is the required angle at C. In practice this element is obtained  very readily and with great precision.  3. By far the most difficult part of the work is to measure the exact  distance between the two points a and h. This is best done by a  system of triangles. Thus, in fig. 2, suppose A and B to be the  extremities of the meridian line, and D E F Gr and H to be prominent  points of the country at such elevations as to be visible the one from  the other. Commencing the operation at A, a line A D, of several  miles in extent, lying along a level plain, if such can be found, is  selected and accurately measured. This is called a base or base line,  and the utmost refinement of methods is required for its measurement.  The base line having been measured, we place an instrument, adapted  to the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles, (usually a  large theodolite,) at A, and measure the horizontal angle DAE,    Ma J   ON ASTRONOMY.   89   and D A M, and also the elevation, if any, of D and E above A. The  instrument is then transported to D, and A D E and E D F are  measured, and also the elevations of F and E above D ; and thus in  succession the instrument is taken to each of the stations and all the    horizontal and vertical angles are measured. The sides of all the  triangles, varying in length from 10 to 40 or 50 miles, may now be  very easily computed. Beginning with A D E, and taking them in  succession, we have in each case all the angles and one side given to  find the other sides. To test the accuracy of the work a second line,  as H B, at or near the extremity of the line is measured. This is  called the base of verification. If any considerable error is found to  exist between the measured and computed length of this line the  whole work must be gone over again. But before we can expect any  close agreement between the computed and measured length of the  base of verification the several stations, D E F and G, must be reduced  to the level surface, that is, to the surface of the water, if we should  suppose the ocean to flow freely over  the land. We must reduce each of  the stations to the continued ocean  surface. Thus, in fig. 3, A mny be  situated on the beach, E on the  summit of a mountain, A G the  curve or line of the ocean surface  continued. We must, in fact, re-  duce the point E to G and compute  the length of the curved line A G  from knowing the length of the  straight line A E and the elevation  of the point. My object here is not  to give any abstract or synopsis of  the method of making this reduc-  tion, but only to indicate what is required to be done. The process,  though somewhat laborious, presents no peculiar difficulty.  It now remains to find the distance from A to B along the meridian  line reduced to the ocean surface. This we do by resolving in succes-  sion the triangles, fig. 2, A D M, M E M, N F 0, G P, and P H B,    90 LECTURES  in whicli we shall have known two angles and the included side.  Adding the distances A M, M N, N 0, F, and P B, we shall have  the entire distance from A to B measured along the continued ocean  level. It is thus that science, hy her magic touch, levels down the  mountains and fills up the valleys, and makes for herself a path  which, we may truly say, the vulture's eye hath not seen.  To solve the problem we have in hand, and determine definitely  the figure and magnitude of the earth, we must have the results of  measurements in different latitudes.  We shall briefly refer to some of the principal measurements which  have been executed before we deduce from them the exact dimensions  of the earth.  From the early part of the ninth century, when the Arabian astrono-  mers, as before stated, measured an arc of the meridian on the plain  of Mesopotamia, this question seems to have been lost sight of for  more than six hundred years.  1. In 1528, Fernel, an eminent physician of Paris, revived the  problem by measuring the distance from Paris to Amiens, in Picardy,  by counting the revolutions of his coach wheels.  2. Nearly a hundred years later, (1617,) Snellens, of Leyden,  measured an arc of the meridian, in Holland, between Alkmaer and  Bergen-op-Zoom. He was the first to adopt the principle of trian-  gulation.  3. Some few years after the measurement of Snellens, the English  astronomer, Norwood, (1635,) measured an arc between London and  York. He measured parts of the distance with a chain, other parts  by pacing, and where the ground was rough he estimated the distance  as well as he could.  The results of these measurements, on account of the imperfection  of methods and instruments, are of little or no value. They only  indicate the growing interest in the problem.  4. Picard's measurement.  It was not until 1G69 that an arc of the meridian was measured  with such care and precision as to inspire confidence in the result.  This was done by Picard, of the French Academy. He was the first  to apply the telescope to instruments for the measure of angles. He  commenced his operations at Malvoisin, near Paris, and terminated  them at Sourdon, near Amiens. For the measurement of terrestrial  angles he used a quadrant of 38 inches radius, and for zenith distances  a sextant of 10 feet radius.  He found for a degree 60.812 fathoms, a result very near the truth,  but it was owing to a fortunate balancing of errors which were sub-  sequently discovered in his work.  5. Up to 16*72 no doubt was entertained of the perfect sphericity of  the earth During this year a circumstance occurred which had a  most important bearing upon this problem. Richer was sent out by  the^ French Academy to Cayenne, in South America, to make obser-  vations on the parallax of Mars. He took with him a pendulum,  carefully adjusted to beat seconds in Paris. On suspending it at  Cayenne, three or four degrees north of the equator, he found that it  lost two minutes and twenty-eight seconds per day. He shortened it   ON ASTRONOMY.   91    to make it beat seconds, and on returning to Paris it was necessary  to restore the original length in order again to beat seconds.  Picard had anticipated that a change of temperature would affect  the rate, but by no means to so great an extent as two minutes and  twenty-eight seconds per day.  The cause of so remarkable a fact of course engaged the attention  of astronomers.  Newton and Huygens both assigned the true cause, viz : the dimin-  ished force of gravity as a consequence of the centrifugal force and  the flattened figure of the earth.  The effect of the centrifugal  force may be illustrated by fig. 4.  Let E P Q S be a section of the  earth made by a meridian circle,  P S the axis, E Q the equator,  and P C Q an imaginary tube  extending from the pole to the  centre, and thence to the equa-  tor. Let this tube be filled with  water and the earth at rest.  The two branches would then be  of equal length. Now let the  earth begin to rotate on the line  P S. The water would imme-  diately settle down in P C and  rise in C Q.  Newton found the ratio of the two axes to be as 229 : 230. There  could be no doubt that the figure w^s flattened pt the pole, the only  question was lioio much?  6. To settle a question of so much interest and of so much importance,  the French Academy determined on extending the arc of Picard.  In 1683, under the direction of the eminent astronomer royal, Do-  minic Cassini, the measurement was extended to some distance south  of Paris, when the death of the minister, Colbert, suddenly inter-  rupted their labors. They were not resumed till 1701, wlien the line  was extended to Perpignan, on the Mediterranean, GÂ° south of Paris.  In 1718 James Cassini, son of the former, continued the measure  ment on the north of Paris to Dunkirk. Thus was this  completed after thirty years of labor.  The unlooked for result was that a degree at the northern extremity  of the arc was lio fathoms shorter than at the southeo-n.  The necessary consequence was that the earth was elotigated, not  fattened, at tlie poles, and that the conclusion of tlie matliematicians  was contradicted by the facts.  This opinion, in opposition to those of Newton and Huygens, was  maintained by Cassini de Thury and his able coadjutors in the  Academy. To confirm so important a result, Cassini measured an  arc on a parallel of latitude extending from Strasburg to Brest, and  found it 300 toises shorter than it would have been if the earth liad  been a perfect sphere. In an elaborate work published by him in  1735 he says, as quoted by Delambre, (Hist. Ast. 18th Century, p.   great work   92 LECTURES  275 :) \" Thus all our operations in longitude as well as latitude concur  in giving to the earth a figure elongated towards the pole.\" He adds :  \" This discovery, so useful to the sciences and to navigation, and so  glorious to France, will be due to the Academy.\"  7. The conflicting results thus obtained, taken in connexion with  the importance of the problem, determined the French Academy to  send out commissions, one to measure an arc of the meridian near the  equator, another in the most northern latitude accessible.  This was in 1*735. The commission to the north was committed  chiefly to Maupertuis and Clairault, while that to the equator was  under the direction of Bouguer and Condamine.  The place selected by Maupertuis and Clairault for the northern  line was at the northern extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia, com-  mencing at Tornea, on the gulf, and terminating at a place called  Kittis, in latitude 66Â° 48' 44\". The work was accomplished amid  great difficulties, arising from the severities of the climate. The  commission returned after an absence of more than two years. An  account of it was published by Clairault in 1743. The length of a  degree was found, to be 61.195 toises. This result, by subsequent  measurement of Swanburg, was found to be slightly erroneous.  The southern commission commenced their operations at Targui in  Peru, near the equator, and continued the line to Cotshequi, about 3Â°  south of it. This commission was absent nine years.* A detailed  account of the work was given by Bouguer in one volume, 8vo., pub-  lished 1749. The length of a degree was found to be 60.4G8 toises.  The results of these measurements dissipated all doubts as to the  earth's figure. They showed an unquestionable lengthening of the  degrees as we go from the equator to the pole, and a consequent flat-  tening at the pole.  8. In the mean time, while these important measurements were in  progress in Peru and Lapland, Cassini de Thury, third of the name  and grandson of Dominic, in connexion with Lacaille, in 1739, re-  measured the entire French arc from Perpignan to Dunkirk, with  every possible care which could insure the utmost accuracy in the  result. Several errors of former measurements were corrected. The  comparison of a degree at the northern and southern extremities of  the arc, of some 400 miles in extent left, no room for doubt as to the  lengthening of the degrees as we proceed to the north. These three  measurements removed all doubts which might have existed as to the  figure of the earth. Thus the mathematicians, who deduced the ob-  lateness from principles purely dynamical, had the satisfaction of  finding their conclusions confirmed by the most elaborate measure-  ments.  The next object of interest was to determine the exact amount ;  that is, to determine the exact length of the two axes of the figure ;  in other words, the equatorial and polar diameters.  9. To determine the exact amount of oblateness, additional mea-  surements in different latitudes and different portions of the earth were  necessary.  â™¦Left France ia May, 1735, returned in 1744.   ON ASTRONOMY.   93   TugS   y A   In 1750 Boscovicli and Le Maire measured an arc from Eome to  Rimini, a distance of nearly 140 miles.  In 1752 Liesganig measured an arc passing througli the observatory  of Vienna, and about the same time Beccaria measured another in the  plains of Lombardy.  In 1764 Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon measured a line of  about 100 miles in length along the valley of the Delaware. They were  engaged at the time in running the boundary line between the States of  Pennsylvania and Maryland, and finding a finelocality for measuring  an arc of the meridian, they informed the Royal Society of London  of the fact and offered to execute the work if the Society would iurnish  the requisite instruments. The Society, under the advice of Dr. Mas-  kelyne, the astronomer royal, gladly accepted the offer of Messrs.  Mason and Dixon. This line is re-  markable as having been actually  measured through its whole extent  with wooden rods,or rather a wooden  frame, sent out for the purpose by  the Royal Society. It was made of  fir, 20 feet long and 4 feet wide, with  adjustments for being leveled by  plumb line. This measurement has  always been regarded as a very ac-  curate one. The latitude of the  middle point of the line is 39Â° 12'  nearly. This arc is one of the 13  used by Airy in determining the  figure of the earth.  10. After the peace 1783 Cassini de Thury addressed a memoir to the  Royal Society of London upon the importance to astronomy of deter-  mining more accurately than had before been done the difference in  longitude between the observatories of Paris and Greenwich. The  suggestion was favorably received and commissions were appointed by  both governments to carry the project into effect by a trigonometrical  survey. General Roy was at the head of the English commission.^  The French operations were committed to Count Cassini, (the 4th of  the name,) Mechain and Legendre.  The English had hitherto taken little part in the prosecution of  these important geodetic labors, but the splendid array of instru-  ments and the practical skill which they brought to the work placed  them second to no others. The great theodolite, constructed for the  purpose by Ramsden, 30 inches in diameter, may almost be said to be  the wonder of the age. It certainly marks an important epocli in the  history of astronomical instruments. The three angles of every spheri-  cal triangle are well known to be greater than two right angles. But  this theodolite, in the hands of General Roy, was the first instrument,  in the history of science, to show the fact by actual measurement. It  is recorded, as a singularly gratifying fact, that in all the primary tri-  angles this spherical excess was apparent, and seldom did it exceed  3\" or 4\" of arc.  The work on both sides of the channel was executed with eminent    94 LECTURES  ability. The computation of the French astronomers, based upon this  triangulation, placed the observatory of Paris 9' 21\" to the east of  Greenwich. The computations of Colonel Mudge gave 9' 19\". 4. In  the mean time, the difference obtained by Dr. Maskelyne from astron-  omical observation was 9' 20\". And nearer than this, it was sug-  gested, the difference probably would never be known ; but the  electric telegraph was not then invented. With this new aid the dif-  ference is fixed at 9' 20\". 63. This last is adopted by the English  Nautical Alman ic.  The triangulation of Great Britain and Ireland now extends from  the iScilly islands, in latitude 49Â° 53', to the Shetland isles, latitude  60Â° 50\" â€” a distance of about 750 miles. During the progress of the  work, commenced in 1791 and continued to the present time, seven  base lines have been measured. The one on Hounslow Heath has  been measured three times â€” once with deal rods, once with glass rods,  and once with a steel chain of exquisite workmanship, made by Rams-  den. The results were as follows:  Length by deal rods 27,405.76 feet.  Length by glass rods 27,403.38 \"  Length by steel chain 27,402.38 \"  The base on Salisbury plains, of between six and seven miles in  length, has been measured twice, first with Ramsden's steel chain  and subsequently with General Colby's compensation bars, the latter  measure exceeded the former by about one foot. Sir J. Herschel says  that the greatest possible error in the Irish line, near Londonderry,  of between seven and eight miles in length, is supposed not to exceed  two inches.  11. Many other arcs of the meridian have been measured. Three  of them deserve to be mentioned, on account of their great extent and  the extreme accuracy of the work.  The Jirst is the great French arc, commenced in 1791, under order  of the National Assembly. The object was to determine a new unit  of measure of length, the metre, which should be based on an invari-  able standard in nature. It was determined to make it the yo o^oVo o\"  part of the meridian of the earth from the equator to the pole. This  magnificent enterprise was assigned to Delambre and Mechain. De-  lambre took the northern section, from Paris to Dunkirk. Mechain  took the southern, from Paris to Perpignan, and extended the same  to Barcelona, in Spain. This arc was subsequently extended, (1806,)  by Biot and Arago, to the island of Fomentera, in the Mediterranean.  The whole arc from Dunkirk to Fomentera covers about 12^Â° of lati-  tude, or about 850 miles. Delambre's base of verification, of about  7.3 miles, differed from its computed lengths by only about 11 inches.  12. The second is the great Indian arc, commenced by Colonel  Lancton in 1802 at a place called Punnce, near Cape Comorin, the  extreme southern point of Hindostan, and extended northward  through about 10Â° of latitude (680 miles.) After the death of Lanc-  ton, in 1823, the work was continued by Captain Everest, who had  been his principal assistant, through an arc of nearly 11^Â° (797 miles.)   ON ASTRONOMY. 95  This whole distance, measured with singular ability, extending from  Cape Comorin to the foot of the Himalay mountains, is 1,477 miles.  Two of Everest's bases of verification, of about 7^ miles in extent,  differed by computation, the one 4 and the other 7 inches from the  measured length.  13. The third is theRussian arc, extending from Ismail on the Danube  to the Arctic sea near the North Cape, being more than 25 degrees  (25Â° 20'.) The work was under the direction of the able astronomer  Strove. It was begun in 1816, and has but recently been completed.  The complete discussion of the observations has not yet been given to  the public. This arc is about 1,750 miles in extent, and is believed  to have been measured with eminent ability.  14. Any sketch of the geodetic operations which serve to determine  the figure of the earth would be incomplete without a notice of the  United States Coast Survey.  The great interest with which this question was regarded in early  times arose from its importance as an astronomical problem; but in  the attempts to devise more accurate methods for the measurement, of  arcs upon the earth's surface, it was found that, for the construction  of accurate maps of any extended portions of the earth, a knowledge  of its precise figure was not only essential, but that the method of  triangulation which was adopted to connect the extreme points of  the arc to be measured, together with the astronomical positions of  those points, formed the best possible basis of a map of the region  traversed by the system of triangles.  This was the origin of the science called geodesy or geodetic sur-  veying. The interest which was felt in the solution of an impor-  tant scientific question was, therefore, soon merged in that which  attended its practical benefits to the human race, in the construction  of accurate maps, showing the boundaries of States and provinces,  and the configuration of sea coasts.  The French arc was first made the basis of a complete map of  France, and most of the measurements of arcs in modern times have  been incidental to the prosecution of extended surveys of the territo-  ries through which they pass.  The figure of the earth having been approximately determined, the  more accurate measurement of its dimensions, from having been the  primary object of the great geodetic operations of the globe, has,  therefore, become secondary or incidental to geodetic surveys. Thus  the Indian arc, the Russian arc, and numerous measurements in Eu-  rope, would, perhaps, not have been undertaken, except as the result  of extended trignometrical surveys for national purposes.  Every improvement in the construction of instruments for geodetic  and astronomical purposes, and in the methods of observation em-  ployed, gives additional value and weight to subsequent measure-  ments, and hence it is that the data derived from the geodetic opera-  tions of the United States Coast Survey for the more accurate solution  of the question of the figure of the earth may be looked for with great  interest.  The important objects of this survey, united with the great extent  of the coast, requires the highest attainable accuracy in the great   96 LECTURES  cliain of triangles which stretches along the coast, forming the basis  of the survey, and in the astronomical determinations connected with  it. It has been demonstrated that, in works of this character, ulti-  mate economy is promoted in proportion to the precision with which  the work is first executed. There is every demand, therefore, for the  most perfect instruments, the most approved methods of observation,  and the best practical skill in establishing the true positions of the  primary points of the survey.  The American Coast Survey now represents, according to the best  authorities, the most perfect forms of practical science applicable to  works of this character ; and a general sketch of the methods era-  ployed in the geodetic operations, in order to illustrate the value of  the new measurements of arcs of the earth's surface which will follow  the completion of the primary chain of triangles along the coast, will  not be out of place in connexion with this subject.  The triangulation of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts when completed  will extend diagonally through 19 degrees of latitude and 30 degrees  of longitude. The extreme points of this triangulation will be dis-  tant from each other, by the general line of the coast, nearly 3,000  miles ; the chain of triangles extending from the eastern boundary of  Maine to the western boundary of Texas. It will probably be many  years, perhaps centuries, before this triangulation will be extended  across the continent to the Pacific ocean ; but, ultimately, this will  undoubtedly come to pass ; in the mean while the survey of the  western coast of our territory is progressing according to the plan  followed on the eastern coast.  The triangulation of the eastern coast is now continuous from  Mount Desert, in Maine, to Shalotte inlet, south of Cape Fear, in  North Carolina ; stretching over more than ten degrees of latitude  and as many degrees of longitude, including the coast of ten States,  and the greater part of the coast of two others ; then, with an interval  of about seventy miles, it extends along the coast of South Carolina  and Georgia.  Large detached portions of the triangulation of the coast of Florida,  Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas have been completed, and  a few years only will be necessary to fill the intervals so as to make a  continuous chain from the eastern boundary of Maine to the western  boundary of Texas.  This triangulation will rest upon ten or twelve principal base lines,  measured on different parts of the coast, which afford the double pur-  pose of starting the work at nearly the same time at different points,  and for ultimate verification of its accuracy.  The accuracy of the work has been tested by the connexion of several  of these bases in the progress of the survey, and the degree of precision  attained is so remarkable as to justify a somewhat detailed description  of the various processes by which aerial distances of many miles length,  and hundreds of miles from the starting point, or base, may be deter-  mined by the wonderful applications of geodesy, with but a few inches  of probable or possible error.  When it is said that a certain part of this triangulation is completed,  it is meant that all the mechanical work in the field for measuring the  base lines and the angles, and for determining the latitudes and longi-   ON ASTRONOMY. 97  tudes by astronomical observation, bas been executed, and tbe com-  putations performed by wbicb the results of the mechanical work are  made available. The calculations of the elements of a survey from  given data are founded on mathematical formulae, and are susceptible  of rigid accuracy ; but the mechanical work in tbe field depende for  its precision upon tlie means employed, and on the skill and care of  the operator. In some of the early attempts, as we have before stated,  to measure great distances on the earth's surface, the only means em-  ployed was counting the revolutions of a carriage wheel, of known  periphery, in travelling over the distance.  When the method of triangulation was invented tlie line to be  determined mechanically was shortened so that, without too much  labor, the whole length could be measured by rods or cluiins; and,  finally, an apparatus was constructed especially for the measurement  of base lines.  Any simple material of whatever form is liable to change its dimen-  sions with a change of temperature, so that a line measured on the  ground by a steel or glass rod, or a chain, would appear to have a  different length if measured in summer, from that which it would have  if measured in winter with the same apparatus. This was found to be  the chief source of error, and although the changes in length of a rod  caused by a given change of temperature may be calculated and a cor-  rection applied to the measurements, yet for primary base lines a more  accurate measuring apparatus was devised, by combining two metallic  bars upon the compensating principle, illustrated in the compensation  pendulum.  This method was first applied by Colonel Colby, in the ordnance  survey of Great Britain. It has been brought to groat perfection in  this country by Professor Bache in the base apparatus of the Coast  Survey.  The great object to be attained in a measuring apparatus of this  kind is such a combination or arrangement that the extreme points of  the compound bar used as measuring limits shall remain at an invari-  able distance apart under all degrees of temperature, and even while  the temperature is changing.  This is effected in the Coast Survey base apparatus by two bars, one of  brass and the other of iron, each a little less than twenty ieet in length,  placed side by side so as to be cai>able of independent parallel motion  on rollers. At one end, the two bars are firmly attached to each other  by means of a block to which they are fastened by screws, the  medium of connexion at the other or free ends of the bars is a lever of  compensation. The brass bar is attached to the lever by a hinge pin,  and the iron bar abuts against the lever, the free end of which is  the point that remains fixed during any change in the length of the  bars ; the points of attachment of the bars to the lever being adjusted  at such a distance from the end of the lever that the motion will be  about this end as a centre. These points are determined by the rela-  tive expansions of the brass and iron, and the cross sections of the  bars are so calculated that they will undergo tbe same changes of  temperature from the same source of heat in the same time. The end  of the lever of compensation abuts against a small secondary rod or  7   98 LECTURES  bar, which is supported parallel to the iron and brass bars', and which  is used for making the contact of the two compound bars during the  operation of measuring. On the opposite end of each pair of compound  bars a corresponding small auxiliary rod is placed, and also a sector  for measuring the slope at which the whole bar is placed.  Two measuring bars being made exactly alike as above described,  are placed in line upon the ground and adjusted so that the small  rods at the end shall be at the same height, the lever end of one  opposite to the sector end of the other ; the rod at the sector end of  the foremost bar is so attached to a small spirit level that by a slight  pressure the bubble will be brought to the centre of the level. The  rod on the end of the other bar, which we have described as abutting  against the lever of compensation, has a sliding motion, which is  resisted by a delicate spiral spring ; the end of this little rod is termi-  nated by a smooth agate plane surface, and the end of the opposite  rod by an agate knife edge. The contact is made by bringing these  ends together, the spirit level insuring the same degree of pressure in  every case.  This is the general description of the apparatus ; the sector is used  for measuring the slope of the ground along which the line extends,  the resulting angle giving the means of reducing the measurements  to horizontal lengths. Each of the compound bars are enclosed in  large tin tubes, to protect them from the air and weather and sudden  change of temperature, and in use these tubes are supported on trestles  made for the purpose.  There are many interesting details of construction which can only  be explained by reference to drawings or to the apparatus itself'^ a full  description of which may be found in the Coast Survey Report of 1854.  With the apparatus we have described a distance of a mile may be  measured in one day, and a distance of ten miles may be measured  with no greater error than a fraction of an inch. The length of each  of the compound bars is kept constantly compared during the meas-  urement of a base line with a standard metallic bar, the length of which  at a given temperature is known.  The necessity for the greatest attainable accuracy in such opera-  tions is apparent, when we remember that any error in the base line  will be greatly multiplied in the triangulation depending upon it.  The true cause of the erroneous results of the measurement of the  first French arc was an error in the base line of Picard, which was  subsequently discovered and corrected as before stated.  A base was measured on Kent island, in Chesapeake bay, to verify  the triangulation between a base on Fire Island (on the south side of  Long Island) and the Chesapeake. The shortest distance between  these base lines is two hundred and eight miles, but the distance  through the triangulation is three hundred and twenty miles. The  Kent Island base, ilve miles and four-tenths long, was tirst calculated  from the triangulation, which embraces thirty-two triangles. The  computed length differed from the length found by measurement only  four inches.  On some parts of the coast, where it is desirable to commence the  work of the survey in advance of the main triangulation, preliminary   ON ASTRONOMY. 99  or secondary \"base lines are measured by means of wooden or iron bars  of simple construction ; but all such measurements are, in time, super-  seded by the progress of the primary triangulation.  In measuring the angles of the primary triangulation theodolites  of various sizes and construction are employed. The largest instru-  ment of this class belonging to the Coast Survey has a circle of thirty  inches diameter. It was designed by Mr. Hassler, the first superin-  tendent of the Survey, and constructed by Trough ton and Simms of  London. The circle is graduated to five minutes, and may be read  to single seconds by means of micrometers. It is provided with a tele-  scope of great power, by which signals many miles distant may be  seen distinctly. This instrument is employed principally on the north-  east part of the coast, where the lines range from twenty to eighty  miles in length. The accuracy of this instrument is such that the  probable error of a single measure of an angle is about one second and  a quarter ; a mean of about thirty measures is taken for each angle.  Another theodolite of nearly similar construction and of twenty-  four inches diameter is also employed in the survey. Besides these,  smaller repeating theodolites of various sizes are used on different  parts of the work.  Various instruments have been employed for the determination of  the latitude of the most prominent points of the triangulation, among  which may be mentioned vertical circles, repeating theodolites, and  especially the zenith sector, designed by Mr. Airy, the astronomer-  royal of England; but all, except the last named, have been found  liable to considerable errors. The zenith sector is accurate and gives  good results, but its great weight and the labor attendant on its use  make it less available for such surveys than an instrument called  the zenith telescope, designed by Captain A, Talcott^ late of the United  States engineers. This instrument is designed to measure by means  of a micrometer the difference of zenith distances of stars which cul-  minate within a short time of each other and near the zenith, on oppo-  site sides of it. It is portable, accurate, and simple, and is perhaps  destined to supersede all others for geodetic purposes.  In the progress of the latitude observations of the survey discrep-  ancies have occurred which can only be accounted for by local irregu-  larities in the figure and density of the earth. These irregularities  are still the subject of investigation. For the determination of the  longitudes of the various points of the survey every means which sci-  ence can affoid has been resorted to. All the observations obtainable  by eclipses, occultations, and moon culminations, made in this coun-  try previously to 1844, together with the simultaneous observations  abroad, so far as they could be found, have been collected and redu-  ced, and similar observations have since been continued at Cambridge,  Philadelphia, Washington, Cliarle^ton, and Cincinnati. All these  stations being connected by the electric-telegraph, their differences  of longitude have been determined with great accuracy, and all the  results are referred to Cambridge, as a common station of reference.  The difference of longitude between Cambridge and Liverpool has  also been determined by means of large numbers of chronometers   1 00 LECTURES  carried repeatedly between the two stations on the Cunard steam-  ships.*  \" The differences of longitude between Cambridge and the prin-  cipal stations of the survey in other sections are determined by the aid  of the electric telegraph, wherever this has been established. In this  method, which is by far the most accurate for determining difference  of longitude, the Coast Survey has taken the lead, and has brought it  to a state of perfection which subsequent operations of a similar nature  executed in Europe have not yet reached.  \"The idea of comparing the local time of different places by means  of the electric telegraph is sufficiently obvious, and dates from the  conception of the telegraph itself; but the refined methods by which  the intervention of human senses and operations, and the consequent  liabilities to error, are, in the greatest possible degree, avoided, and  by which the time of transmission is measured and eliminated from  the longitude, have been the result of careful study and lona; expe-  rience. The method of recording observations of time on a chrono-  graphic register, by means of a galvanic circuit, known in Europe as  the American method, originated in the Coast Survey with the first  attempts to determine longitude by means of the electro-magnetic  telegraph. The chronogrophic record is made on a cylinder, revolving  with nearly uniform velocity, covered with a sheet of paper, u]wn  which a pen traces a line, interrupted or deflected for an instant  through the agency of an electro-magnet_, every time the pendulum  of the clock passes the vertical, and in doing so interrupts a galvanic  circuit. Either cylinder or pen are at the same time slowly moving  lengthwise, so that the line formed is a long spiral, which is thus  graduated into spaces corresponding to seconds of time, and described  with uniform velocity. When any instant of time is to be recorded,  the observer strikes a finger-key, which also breaks the galvanic  circuit and causes a similar mark to be made on the record, the position  of which, in reference to the adjacent seconds marks, can be read off  with great precision. In the chronographs employed in the Coast  Survey a second is generally represented by from one-half to three-  quarters of an inch, the cylinder being regulated so as to make one  revolution in half a minute.  \"By an ingenious arrangement in the clock the break for every sixty  seconds or minute is omitted, and every five minutes two breaks are  omitted. By this means a whole sheet may be read off without any  other note than the time of beginning and ending.  \"The method of determining longitudes by means of the electric  telegraph is substantially and in brief as follows : A transit instru-  ment, astronomical clock, and chronograph are mounted at each  station. Alter suitable observations for instrumental corrections at  each station, which are recorded only at the place of observation, the  clock at the eastern station is first put in connexion with the circui  so as to write on the chronographs at both stations.  â€¢â€¢â– â€¢ The preceding account of the details of the operations of the Coast Survey has been  furnished by Professor Trowbridge, and what follows is copied from the report of a com-  mittee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.   ON ASTRONOMY. 101  \" A number of stars, culminating near the zenith of the two stations,  are selected by the observers. As they appear first upon the eastern  meridian their transit is recorded by the observer striking the finger-  key upon the chronograpliic registers at both stations. Alter an  interval of time equivalent to the difference of longitude between the  two places, which is measured by the clock, the same stars appear on  the western meridian, and the observer at that station records this  transit precisely as the other had done, and the dilference of the two  records of time is the measure of the difference of longitude.  \" It will be observed that these records have been obtained at both  stations, and a little reflection will show that if there be any sensible  interval of time consumed in the transmission of signals, the differ-  ence of longitude obtained from the record at the eastern station will  be too great by that interval, and that at the western station will be  too small by the same amount. The mean result will give the longi-  tude tree from this error, and the difference of measure the time of  transmission of the signals through the whole circuit.  \"Ten stars are generally exchanged with the eastern clock in the  circuit, and, after the first five, the transit instrument is reversed so  as to eliminate any residual error in the correction for collimation.  The western clock is next put on and the same operation repeated  â– with ten other zenith stars. Not only is the result improved by the  accumulation of individual results, but the advantage is gained that  the interval is measured by another clock, and the time of transmis-  sion eliminated in the inverse order of effects. The transits of the  stars are generally recorded over fifteen wires. After the exchange  of signals by the second clock is completed, local observations for  instrumental corrections are again made, which conclude the night's  work. These operations are repeated on, at least, three different  nights, after which the observers and instruments exchange places, so  as to eliminate the possible errors arising from causes connected with  their individual peculiarities.  \" By the perfect and admirable method just sketched we are able to  measure arcs of longitude with the same degree of accuracy with which  arcs of latitude have heretofore been ascertained, and a new element  has thus been introduced into geodesy. Since the general introduc-  tion of the electric telegraph and the development of the American  method of longitudes it has been applied to many of tlie oldt^r Euro-  pean geodetic surveys ; and, in general, a very full acknowledgment  has been made of their indebtedness to American science by the emi-  nent geometers having charge of such works.  \"It was one of the earliest discoveries resulting from the telegraphic  determinations of longitude that the time transmission of signals  between stations several hundred miles apart is quite sensible, and  that it appears, in a great degree, to depend on the distance. On the  telegraph lines used in this country, where large iron wire is employed,  and the circuit is completed through the earth, the rate of transmis-  sion has been found to be from 11,000 to 20,000 miles per second.  Whether this actually was the velocity of the galvanic current, or  whether it rather measures the time during which the current must   102 LECIUEES  be established in order to produce the effects that we observe, is for the  present an unsolved question.  \" The telegraphic determinations of longitude have been extended  from Washington northward to Philadelphia, New York, Cambridge,  Bangor, and Halifax, and southward to Petersburg, Wilmington,  Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, and New Orleans.  \" Great credit is due to the public spirit of the telegraph companies,  who have extended every facility to the operations of the Coast Survey,  and have given the use of the line after working hours free of charge.  \" In sections of the coast to which the telegraph has not yet pene-  trated, such as Florida, Texas, and the Pacific coast, the longitudes of  cardinal points are determined by observations of moon culminations  and by chronometer.  ' ' Corresponding observations of moon culminations are made at several  American observatories, at the expense of the Coast Survey ; and most  valuable aid is derived from the series of meridian observations of the  moon made at Greenwich, which are always most promptly obtained  through the kindness of the astronomer-royal. The manner in which  the reductions are made to keep pace with the observations at the  latter observatory is admirable, and wortliy of general imitation.  \"The chronometric determination of longitude between Savannah  and Fernandina, in Florida, the details of which have been communi-  cated to the American Association at the Montreal meeting, may serve,  in plan of execution and mode of discussion, as a model tor operations  of a similar character.  ^' The triangulation of the eastern States will furnish a measurement  of one arc of meridian of over three degrees in length between the  island of Nantucket and Mount Blue, in Maine ; another of equal ex-  tent along the Chesapeake Bay and southward ; and, by the admirable  method of determining differences of longitude by the electric tele-  graph an arc of parallel of latitude embracing over ten degrees of lon-  gitude, may be measured along the Gulf of Mexico.\"  These measurements cannot fail to be of great importance in estab-  lishing correct values for the elements of the earth's dimensions, and  the result will be one of those valuable contributions to science which  attend the thorough prosecution of works of this character.  The results of all the measurements in different parts of the earth  indicate a lengthening of the degrees as we go towards the pole ;  but there are many discrepancies, some, no doubt, the result of  the imperfection of instruments and the unavoidable error of observa-  tion. But there are still others which are not probably traceable to  these sources. They clearly show that the earth is flattened at the  poles, but they also show it has irregularities of figure which are not  yet fully explained. If we take the mean results of all the best mea-  surements, we have for the length of a degree at the equator 68.7  miles, nearly 362,626 feet ; at the arctic circle, 66Â° 20', 69.4 miles,  nearly 365,744 feet ; difference 3,118 feet.  15. With the measured length of the degrees it is easy to obtain  the exact figure of the earth.  Thus, fig. 5^ if A B is a measured arc of one degree near the pole,   ON ASTRONOMY. 103  the plumb line at the two extremities will not meet at 0, the centre  of the earth, but at C, some distance below. We may now suppose  A B to be an arc of one degree upon the circle whose radius is A 0.  That being supposed, we shall readily know the whole circumference,  which is 360 times A B ; and knowing the circumference we can  read'ly find the radius, A C, which is known as the radii of curvatw^e.  And by this is meant that the arc A B will coincide with a circle  drawn round C as a centre, and A C as a radius, more nearly than  with any other circle which can be drawn.  Assuming the meridian curve to be an eclipse with two radii of  curvature, we can compute the two semi-axes of the figure N and  E. The ratio of these two, the polar and equatorial radii, gives the  oblateness or ellipticity.  Professor Airy, some years ago, selected thirteen of the most reliable  arcs, and from the combinations, two and two, deduced the probable  value of the polar and equatorial diameters, as follows :  Polar diameter in miles 7899.17 Kadii 3949.58  Equatorial diameter in miles 7925.65 \" 3962.82  Difference 13.24   More recently, Bessel, selecting eleven arcs, some of them the same  and others different from those of Airy, by widely different methods  computed the values, as follows :  Polar diameter in miles 7899.11 Eadii 3949.55  Equatorial diameter in miles 7925.60 \" 3962.80  Difference , 13.25   It is not a little remarkable that results based upon different mea-  surements and computed by different methods, and in both cases, as  Sir John Hersliel remarks, \" the mass of figures to be gone through  with being enormous,\" â€” I say it is most remarkable that the differ-  ence in the length of the earth's radius, as determined in the two  cases, should be less than the -j^-^ part of a mile. Any residual  error which may affect these results must be extremely small.  We then have for the figure of the earth a spheroid flattened at the  poles to such an extent that the polar radius is 13^ miles shorter than  the equatorial. This difference divided by the equatorial radius gives  the oblateness or ellipticity. It comes very near to 3 Jy, more exactly  jgV. r- This variation from perfect sphericity in a 20-incli globe could  scarcely be detected by the most accurate eye^ and yet this oblateness  of the earth enters as an essential element into many of the most  important and curious probleu>s in astronomy. The equatorial cir-  cumference of the earth is 24,886 miles. It is proper to remark, in   104   LECTURES   conclusion, that there are so many discrepancies in the results of these  computations as to force upon astronomers the conviction that the  figure of the earth is not that of a spheroid of revolution. There  must be in different portions of the surface local depressions and eleva-  tions which are most probably due to unequal densities in the interior.  The surface, strictly speaking, is warped and irregular. But these  irregularities, though capable of being detected, are very small.  Such are the results of two centuries of arduous scientific labor  upon the figure and magnitude of the earth ; labor in the field and  in the study, which has put in requisition the utmost skill of mechanic  arts, and exhausted the resources of mathematical analysis.   LAW OP GRAVITATION.  In my previous lecture I endeavored to explain the method of find-  ing the exact figure and magnitude of the earth.  1. I shall this evening call your attention to the law of gravitation.  This may be termed the great law of the material universe. There  is no single law of nature which reveals so much, none which controls  and determines so many physical conditions and events, none which  carries us so far into. the distant future, or conducts us back so far to  contemplate the past. This law determines alike the fall of a pebble,  the mighty swell of the ocean, and the vast sweep of the comet,  coursing its fiery track of a thousand years. It guides every planet  in its orbit round the central sun, and, in the midst of inevitable and  endless perturbations, guarantees the final stability and harmony of  the system. In its immense range of applications it invites to the  sublimest contemplations of which the human mind is capable.   i^^i:=   S.      I   A_J_   Fie-. 6.   S   2. The law of gravity may be stated as follows, viz: every particle  of matter attracts every other particle by a force proportional to the  mass, and inversely as the square of the distance.   ON A81RONOMY. 105  Each separate body in the system attracts every other body by the  same law. The earth, for instance, has a fixed mass ; it attracts the  moon and the sun, and each of the phmets, by a force proportional to  its mass, and inversely as the squares of their respective distances.  To illustrate this law, as it applies to the solar system, let S in  fig. 6 represent the sun.  Suppose the planets placed at their relative distances, the earth's  distance being unity, then the figures in the upper part of the dia-  gram will represent the relative distances of the other planets, viz :  Mars 1.5, Ceres, as the mean of the asteroids, 2.8, Jupiter 5.2,  Saturn 9.5, Uranus 19.1, and Neptune 30. The force of the solar at-  traction upon them will then be represented by the figures on the  lower part of the diagram, which are inversely as the squares of the  distances. The attraction on the earth being 1, on Mars it will be yV,  on Ceres y|y, on Jupiter r^V, on Saturn ^Vj ^^ Uranus .. 1 o, ^^'^ on  Neptune g J-q. If their orbitual motions were stopped, the earth would  move toward the sun 900 times as fast as Neptune.  This enables us to form a true conception of what this law is. Of  the nature of gravity itself we know nothing. We give the name of  law to the effects which it produces. Everything connectsd with the  history and progress of so grand a principle in nature must awaken a  special interest. Any law or principle which enables the astronomer  to determine, not with uncertainty and vague conjecture, but with the  utmost precision, the relative position of the heavenly bodies for ages  past and for ages to come, challenges our admiration. The astrono-  mer turns his telescope to the heavens and watches the progress of the  stars as they enter and cross his field of view, and marks the hour,  minute, and second when one of them disappears for an instant behind a  spider's web which is stretched across his field of view. Suppose the  telescope to stand unmolested, it is not difficult to predict the hour,  minute, and second when the same star will disappear behind the  same spider line after the lapse of a hundred years. The earth will,  in the mean time, have made a hundred revolutions around her orbit  of nearly 600,000,000 of miles, but the force of gravity will have kept  her in her appointed track. She pursues her elliptic course without  weariness or change.  3. But let us glance at the history of the discovery of this great law.  Speculations upon the causes of the heavenly motions were probably  coeval with the observations which served to make them known.  Many of these speculations which have come down to us are charac-  terized by great crudeness, but they all show the perpetual tendency  of the human mind to ascend from phenomena to their causes.  The earlier Greek astronomers introduced a system of crystalline  transpartnt spheres, revolving one within another, and carrying the  planets with them round the earth as a centre. Ear beyond these  crystalline planetary spheres was the \" primum mobile,\" the starry  sphere, revolving from east to west in twenty-four hours. This system  was incorporated into the philoso[)hy of Aristotle, and seems to have  commanded the assent of mankind for many ages. Its truth was  hardly drawn into doubt till the revival or commencement of true   106 LECTURES  astronomical science in the seventeenth century. And even then the  clearest and strongest intellects were slow in extricating themselves  from the trammels of the Aristotelian philosophy.  It was not until the time of Kepler that any real progress was  made in discovering the true laws of planetary motion. He discarded  all dependence upon authority. His views were independent and  hold, but in many respects extremely defective and often whimsical.  Yet his labors will ever be regarded as forming a brilliant epoch in  the history of astronomy.  It is true that Copernicus had established the true system of the  world, which fixes the sua in the centre ; Galileo had demonstrated  the laws of motion, in falling bodies, and laid the foundation of  dynamical science ; Tycho Brahe had, for a quarter of a century, most  diligently watched and recorded the motions of the heavenly bodies.  But neither of these illustrious astronomers had ventured any hypo-  thesis for explaining the cause of those motions.  By the laborious comparison of the observations of Tycho, Kepler  discovered the three laws of planetary motion which bear his name,  and which constitute the ground work of physical astronomy. They  are familiar to every student. The first is, that the planets revolve in  elliptical orbits ; the second, that the radius-vector, or the line draivn  from the sun to the planet, describes equal areas in equal times, in what-  ever part of the orbit it is located ; the third, that the squares of the  periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the mean distances. This  third law may justly be regarded as one of the grandest inductions in  the whole range of physical science. But Kepler was still far from  having any just conception of the true physical cause of these motions.  He rejected the crystalline spheres of the G-reeks and located in the  sun a kind of central virtue, by which the planetary motions were  maintained. But this force or vii^tue, for he uses both terms, must  have the efiect, as he perceived, not of drawing bodies directly toioard  the sun, but of moving them across or athwart this line of direction.  It must, in some way, carry bodies round the sun.  In order to render this idea plausible he was obliged to introduce a  whirling fiuid which bore tbe planets round in the same manner that  a running stream carries a boat. This was substantially the same  hypothesis which, nearly half a century later, was propounded by  Des Cartes, and was known as his celebrated system of vortices.  But, in addition to his other agencies, Kepler gravely believed and  taught that each planet was animated by a spirit which held to the  matter of the planet a relation analogous to that which the mind of  man holds to his body. This great animal spirit acted an important  part in giving to the planet the right direction.  Nor can we be much surprised at this fancy when we find even the  great Newton gravely recording his suspicion, as he does in his Prin-  cipia, that \" the spirit which constitutes the most subtile and best  portion of our atmosphere, and which is necessary to all life, is derived  from comets.\"  But, unsuccessful as Kepler was in discovering the true physical  cause of the planetary motions â€” the law which yms underlying his   ON ASTRONOMY. 107  laws â€” lie gave a great impulse to tlie spirit of inquiry. The energies  of all the ablest mathematicians and astronomers of the age were con-  centrated upon this problem.  In the mean time other branches of science were throwing light  upon this. Gilbert, of England, had investigated the laws of mag-  netism, and in 1600 had published a work, remarkable for that period,  on the magnet. This work was known to Galileo and Kepler, and  was much esteemed by them. The attraction between two magnets  suggested the idea that some analogous force might exist between  other bodies. Gilbert explained the influence of the earth upon the  moon by regarding the earth as a great loadstone. In like manner,  he supposed the moon to have a reciprocal action upon the earth,  not only upon the matter of the earth but upon \"certain subterra-  nean humors and s|)irits\" which are drawn out and modified by the  moon's action. Galileo and Kepler, as Grant says, both professed  themselves to be much indebted to the views contained in Gilbert's  work upon the magnet.  Kepler fully adopted the principle of some sort of attraction, but  how that force acted in maintaining the orbits he did not comprehend.  His great work on astronomy, the \"Astronomia Nova,\" was published  in 1609. In this work he maintains that some sort of attraction  exists between all the planets of the sy8tem_, and that the planetary  motions are maintained by some sort of influence emanating from the  sun. Tie seemed to be constantly impressed with the idea that a cen~  tripelal force alone would not keep a planet in motion. It must have  some force either pulling it or pushing along in its course. And hence  he was obliged, on this hypothesis, to make the sun-force propel a  planet in a direction perpendicular to the radius- vector.  We may judge how slow was the progress of true ideas upon this  subject from the fact that the law of gravitation was not discovered  till considerably more than half a century after the publication of  Kepler's work, before mentioned.  In the mean while the law of planetary attraction engaged the  attention of Galileo, of Borelli, of BouUiau, of Des Cartes, Cassini,  Huygheus, Hooke, Halley, Sir Christopher Wren, and finally of  Newton. Among these Christian Huyghens, by common consent, is  second only to the illustrious Newton. Huyghens, who preceded  Newton by a few years published a very remarkable work in 1671 on  the pendulum. In this work, entitled \" DeHorologio Oscillatorio,\"  he inserts several important theorems respecting the motion of a  heavenly body, which is constantly drawn to a fixed centre Borelli,  of Pisa, had, a few years before, (1666,) published a work in which  he quite accurately describes the action of centrifugal and centripetal  forces, and shows that they would together cause a body to revolve in  a circular orbit.  At this time, 1665, when Newton's attention was first drawn to the  subject, it had become a common opinion, though by no means a uni-  versal one, that the planets were retained in their orbits by a force  residing in the sun. And the great point at issue now was to deter-  mine what kind of an orbit it would produce, and how it varied with  the distance ; whether it was inversely as the distance, or inversely as   108   LECTURES   the square of the distance^ or whether it varied in some more compli-  cated ratio of the distance.  Bouilliau,*a French astronomer, cotemporary with Newton, though  older, is said to have been the first to suggest the inverse ratio  of the square of the distance as the law of variation, which he did in.  1645. Kepler maintained the opinion that the variation was inversely  as the distance simply. Hooke made the announcement that he had  demonstrated the law to be as the square inversely, but declined show-  ing his demonstration, and it finally appeared that he never had one.  It, indeed, seemed to be the prevailing opinion that the force must vary  inversely as the square of the distance. Wren concurred in this  opinion, but he could give no proof. Halley was in the same predica-  ment. They had both made the question a subject of special study.  Huyghens had once adopted this view of the question, but failing to  find any satisfactory proof had rejected it. Such was the state of the  problem when Newton entered upon its investigation. The progress  and result of his inquiries will always possess a singular interest in  the history of astronomy.  It was in the summer of 1665, when the breaking out of the plague  in Cambridge had forced Newton to leave the place, that he retired  to his native village of Woolsthorpe. Witnessing the fall of an  apple, as the story is usually told and sanctioned by Brewster,  he conceived the idea that this same terrestrial gravity which caused  the apple to fall, and which certainly extended to the highest attain-  able elevations, might extend even to the moon, and be the force  which retained her in her orbit. To produce this effect there must  be a certain determinate force directed towards the earth, acting  constantly upon the moon, and deflecting her from a right line into  the curve which forms the orbit. With the distance of the moon and  the velocity of revolution this force could easily be computed. It only  remained to see whether the terrestrial gravity at that distance was  sufficient to produce precisely that effect.  The principle upon which this conclusion rests will be readily  understood by reference to figure 7.  Let E be the earth, M B a portion  of the moon's orbit, and suppose  that M B is so small a portion as to  be passed over by the moon in one  minute of time. It was a well es-  tablished principle in mechanics that  any body moving in a curved line  tends to recede from the centre, and  if not constantly restrained by some  force, to move in a straight line tan-  gent to the curve. Thus if the at-  traction of the earth should be sus-  pended at the instant the moon  reached the point, she would move  in the straight line M and not in the curved line M B. Now, if we    TvaJ   * Written also Bouilland and Boidliand, born 1605, died 1694.   ON ASTRONOMY. 109  suppose the velocity of the moon to he such as to carry it from M to  in -one minute, how hirge a force directed towards the earth would  be necessary to make it move in the arc MB? If we construct a par-  allelogram having M for one side, M A for another, and M B (con-  sidered as a straight line) for its diagonal, then M A must be the  measure of the force necessary to keep the moon in her orbit. But  this line M A is the versed sine of the arc M B. Hence we know, and  this was Newton's mode of investigation, that the force, whatever it  is, which retains the moon in her orbit must be directed to the earth,  and must be such as to cause a body to fall through the versed sine  of any small arc in the same time that the body is actually occupied  in describing that arc. Now, the distance of the moon being known,  as it was proximately, and the time of revolution being also known,  it was easy to compute the length of the arc passed over in any small  portion of time and also its versed sine. Hence the distance M A  becomes a known distance. A body at the earth's surface falls through  a known distance in one minute. Call this distance h and let R be the  radius of the earth, and D the distance of the moon, and x the distance  through which the earth's attraction would cause a body to fall if  placed at the moon, then we should have D\"^ : B^ : : /i : x. To answer  the required purpose, x must equal M A. This was jNewton's course  of reasoning.  Taking the measure of a degree on the meridian to be 60 miles,  as determined by Fernel, and then generally adopted, he deduced the  earth's radius, and then found, by making the calculation, that the  attraction of the earth at the distance of the moon was insufficient  to produce the required effect. It equally failed whether it was supposed  to vary inversely as the distance simply, or as the square of the  distance. And the difference was too great to be attributed to any  error in the calculation, or in the moon's motion.  In the s|)irit of true philosophy he rejected the hypothesis which  was insufhcient to account for the facts. And, singuhir as it may  appear, he seems, from anything now known of his labors, to have  dropped the investigation for nearly twenty years.  The measurement of arc of the meridian, in France, by Picard, which  gave a more correct measure of the earth's radius, recalled his atten-  tion to the subject. And repeating his calculation with this corrected  measure, he had the satisfaction of finding that with the inverse ratio,  the square, the intensity of the terrestrial gravity was almost pre-  cisely that which was required in order to keep the moon in her orbit.  This was the \" experimentum crucis.\" The great law of nature was  established.  We now know that the mean distance of the moon is very nearly  60 times the earth's radius. The terrestrial gravity varying according  to this law, it will at that distance be 3^\\,o P'^i't of wuat it is at the  earth's surface. Hence a body at the moon will fall through the same  distance (16.1 feet) in one minute, that it will fall at the earth's surface  in one second. And this is almost precisely the versed sine of the  arc for one minute described by the moon's mean motion.  A like test was applied to the planets as influenced by the attraction  of the sun, and the same law was found to obtain.   110 LECTURES  The final verification of the law of gravity is, that it predicts the  disturbing effects which one body must have upon another.  With this law in his hand the astronomer in his study has pre-  dicted inequalities in the planetary motions which no observer had  detected, and many which, though real, were too small to be detected  till they were pointed out and made the subject of special observation.  The attention of Newton was particularly called to the law of gravi-  tation in 1665. The Principia, in which his discoveries v/ere given  to the world, was not published till 1687. The doctrines which he  announced were slow in winning their way to scientific favor. Out of  England, for a period of nearly forty years, they were either not known  or were known only to be rejected. The theory of vortices, as promul-  gated by Des Cartes, had obtained great popularity on the continent,  and was adopted by most of the eminent continental astronomers of  the age.  Euyghens adopted the Newtonian doctrines only in part. Leibnitz  and John Bernouilli were conspicuous in opposition to them. Cassini  and Miraldi, to the end of their lives, were borne along by the vortices  of Des Cartes. \"On the continent,\" says Grant, \"all the great  mathematicians were unanimous in their hostility to the Newtonian  theory.\" At length, in 1732, forty-five years after the publication of  the Principia, and five alter the death of Newton, Maupertuis, of  the French Academy, was the first to adopt and defend the doctrines  of the Principia. But the writer who did most to commend the New-  tonian theory to favor in France was, probably, Voltaire, who, in  1738, published a brief, popular exposition of Newton's work, which  was widely circulated and did much to conciliate the favor of the  learned to the views of the great English philosopher. But if the  French astronomers in the first instance sinned against true science  in rejecting the doctrine of Newton, the labors of Clairault and La  Place have made ample atonement for it since. The theory of Newton  is universally received ; the vortices of Des Cartes survive only as a  memorable example of scientific error.  Having given a sketch of the history of the law of gravitation, I  must content myself with adverting to two or three illustrations.  1. What kind of a curve may a heavenly body describe, under the  action of this law?  Newton showed that the curve might be a circle^ an ellipse, a par-  abola, or a hyperbola, being the four curves made by the section of a  cone, and it could not revolve in any other. Thus, in figure 8 let S  represent the place of the sun, and let A represent any body placed  at any given distance, as at A. Now suppose it receives an impulse in  a direction perpendicular to the radius- vector S A, the form of the  orbit which it will describe will depend upon the intensity of this  impulse. Any impulse in that direction will produce a cantrifugal  force. If this centrifugal force is exactly equal to the centripetal force  of the sun, the body will describe a circle, A C, about S as a centre ;  if it receives a less impulse it will describe an ellipse, as A E, of which  A is the aphelion and S the remoter focus ; if it receives a greater  impulse it will still describe an ellipse, as A E, of which A is the peri.   ON ASTRONOMY.   Ill   helion and S the nearer focus. If we now suppose the impulse to  grow stronger and stronger, the ellipse will become more and more  elongated, the aphelion E receding farther and farther, until the curve  changes into a parabola, and the two branches never meet. The par-  ticular impulsive velocity necessary to produce a parabola is that  which a body would acquire under the action of the sun in falling  from an infinite distance. This velocity would not be infinite. The   rij.U   m    \\TL   velocity due to an infinite distance is finite, and hence might be in-  creased. Any increase of that velocity would cause the body to move  in a hyperbola, as A H. One impulsive velocity only will produce a  circle, one only a parabola ; an infinite number an ellipse, an infinite  number a hyperbola. Hence the antecedent probability of a truly  circular or parabolic orbit is only as one to millions, while the proba-  bility of an elliptical or hyperbolic orbit is as millions to one. And  this accords with the facts of astronomy, so far as they are known.  2. The secular acceleration of the moon's mean motion in longitude.  By the comparison of some ancient eclipses with their computed  times, Halley, as early as 1693, suspected an acceleration in the  moon's mean motion, but the question was not fully investigated till  half a century later, when more accurate calculation placed the fact  beyond all doubt. In 1749 Dunthorne presented to the Royal Society  of London an elaborate paper upon the subject, in which he deter-  mined the acceleration to be ten seconds in a hundred years, reckoned  from 1700; that is, the mean motion being taken, the moon arrives at  the meridian of any fixed star ten seconds sooner, at the close of a  century, than she would if her mean motion had continued tlie same  as it was at the beginning of it. And, as a consequence of this, she  would come to the meridian of any particular place ten seconds later  than she otherwise would. The recent profound researches of Hansen,  of Seeberg, upon the lunar irregularities have led him to adopt 13  seconds as the secular acceleration. \"The moon,\" says Grant in his  excellent History of Physical Astronomy, \"is about two hours later   112 LECTURES  in coming to the meridian than she would have been if she had re-  tained the same mean motion as she had in the time of the earliest  Chaldean observations.\" If we adopt the new coefficient of Hansen,  13\", it will increase the difference by about half an hour. Hence, in  assigning the moon's place in any remote period in the past by the  use of the modern tables, the assigned place will be less advanced in  longitude than the actual place. The accurate determination of this  coefficient of acceleration is of the utmost importance in verifying the  ancient eclipses.  The cause of this acceleration for a long time baffled the severest  scrutiny. The French Academy offered its astronomical prize of 1770,  1772, and 1774, for an investigation which should have for its object  to show whether it could be produced by the law of gravitation. The  first prize was taken by Euler, the second was shared by Euler and  Legrange, the third was awarded to Legrange alone. Both of these  eminent mathematicians concurred in the conclusion that it could not  be produced by the action of gravity. The language of Euler in the  memoir which bore off the prize is very explicit, as follows: \"There  is not one of the equations about which any uncertainty prevails, and  now it appears to be established by indisputable evidence that the  secular inequality in the moon's mean motion cannot be produced by  the forces of gravitation.\" The failure of Euler and Legrange in at-  tempting to trace this inequality to the effect of gravity, and the  great weight of their authority, may have deterred others from re-  peating the investigation, and turned their attention to some other  quarter for a solution.  Newton was inclined to refer it to the resistance of the medium in  which the moon moved, and his conclusion â€” the only one, indeed,  which his premises permitted â€” was, that the moon was winding in  toward the earth, and must ultimately fall upon it.  But the profound analysis of Laplace, in 1787, revealed what had  escaped the sagacity of Newton and Legrange. He traced it to a very  slow and almost imperceptible change in the form of the earth's orbit,  technically called the secular diminution of the eccentricity of the  earth's orbit.  The general manner in which this inequality is produced is not  difficult to be understood. One of the consequences of gravity deduced  by Newton was, that the disturbing force of the sun's attraction upon  the moon had the effect to diminish the gravity of the moon to the  earth by about .^ â€ž- part of it. If the earth and moon were removed  to a greater distance from the sun the consequence would be that the  moon would be drawn down nearer to the earth, and would make her  revolution in a shorter time, because, with an unchanged actual  volocity, she would revolve in a smaller orbit. Now, this is precisely  the effect of the diminution of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.  Thus, in fig. 9, let A C B D represent the earth's orbit, S the  place of the sun, A B the major axis, and C D the minor. The form  of the orbit has been for many ages undergoing a gradual change,  almost imperceptible, but still continuous. This change is due to the  disturbing action of the planets upon the earth, and is one of those   ON ASTRONOMY.   113    periodic inequalities which stretches  over an immense cycle of ages. The  nature of this change will be readily-  seen by a reference to fig. 9. A B,  the major axis, remains always the  Mime, while C D, the minor axis,  5 increases in length, and the sun  comes nearer to the centre. If we  suppose the full line, A C B D, to  represent the orbit as it was some  ages back, thebroken line, AG BF,  will represent it now. The earth  and moon, by being carried into  a wider curve, are less affected by  the disturbing force of the sun. The earth's power upon the moon  becomes relatively increased, and hence, as before stated, the gradual  acceleration.  The eccentricity of the earth's orbit is now about 0.0168 ; that is,  the distance from the centre to one of the foci is yj o o o P^'''^ o^ ^^^^ mean  radius. Leverrier, in a remarkable memoir upon the secular varia-  tions of the orbits of the seven principal planets, has shown that the  eccentricity of the earth's orbit will continue to diminish for about  24,000 years, when it will be reduced to 0.0033, or about -! of its  present value. It will then begin to increase, and will go on in-  creasing for many thousands of years. The moon will then begin to  wind out instead of winding in, and will enter upon her appointed but  immense cycle of secular retardation. The anticipated catastrophy of  a collision between the earth and moon will be happily prevented.  3. I select as a third illustration the discovery of the planet Nep-  tune. This will ever be regarded as one of the grandest achievements  of science.  The planet Uranus was discovered by the elder Hersch 1 in 1781.  On searching the records of previous observers it was found that the  planet had been observed and its place recorded nineteen times before  it was suspected to be a planet. By this means it was possible to  determine the orbit and construct tables much sooner than could other-  wise have been done. The French Academy made its orbit the subject  of a prize in 1790. Delambre was the successful competitor. He  subsequently computed tables of this planet. It was pretty soon  found that Delambre's tables did not well represent the observed  places of the planet. These inequalities were so great that new tables  were computed by Bourvard in 1821. But these, again, in a few  years, were found to be nearly as defective as Delambre's, and required  correcting. From 1795 to 1822 the observed longitude was in advance  of the computed. The planet then fell back till 1830 and 1831, when  the observed and computed longitudes agreed. The observed place  then rapidly fell behind the computed place. The error of the tables  in giving the geocentric place, in 1835, was 30\"; in 1838, 50\"; in  1841, 70\". The attempt further to correct the elements as given by  8   1 1 4 LECTURES  the tables soon revealed the fact that no orbit could be assigned which  would harmonize the observations. Bourvard himself was t'np first to  suggest that the motion of Uranus might be disturbed by an unknoion  'planet outside of it. This soon became the prevailing impression  among astronomers. So confident had astronomers become of its  existence that just two weeks before its discovery Sir John Herschel,  in addressing the British Association at Southampton, (September  10, 1846,) says, \" its movements have been felt trembling along the  far-reaching line of our analysis with a certainty hardly inferior to  occular demonstration.\"  Supposing such a planet to exist, the problem of determining its po-  sition was one of extreme difficulty, yielding only to the very highest  powers of mathematical analysis. It would seem that but few astrono-  mers in Europe had the hardihood to engage in the enterprise. The  illustrious Bessel had it in contemplation, but death removed him too  soon from the scene of his labors and left the task to other hands.  The problem, as is well known, was oslved, separately and almost  simultaneously, by two youthful astronomers, Adams and Leverrier,  'â– ^ par ncbile fratrnm.\" Leverrier was the first to announce his result.  He wrote to his friend Dr. Galle, of Berlin, assigning the place of  the new planet. \"Turn your telescope,\" said he, \"to that point,  and there you will see it.\" The letter was received in Berlin on the  23d of September, 1846. On the same evening Dr. Galle turned his  telescope to the point designated by Leverrier, and both he and the  veteran Enke saw a star of the eighth magnitude in a position where  no star was laid down in Dr. Brenicker's chart, then recently pub-  lished by the Berlin Academy. It was the veritable planet which  had so long had a finger in disturbing the good order of Uranus.  The heliocentric longitude of the new planet, as fixed by Leverrier,  was 326Â° 0'. That assigned by Adams, without any knowledge of  Leverrier's work, was 329Â° 19'. The same, deduced from Dr. Galle's  observation, was 326Â° 52', being within a single degree of the place  assigned it by the computation of Leverrier. Never had science a  prouder triumph than was achieved on that memorable night.  On examining the record of Lalande, it was found that he had  twice observed this planet as a star, viz : on the 8tli and 10th of May,  1*795. I may remark, in closing, that the first computation of the orbit  of Neptune was by an eminent American astronomer, the late Sears C.  Walker, and that Professor Pierce, of Harvard University, solved the  inverse problem, namely, that of deducing from the data the pertur-  bations which Neptune ought to produce on the planet Uranus.*  SOLAR PARALLAX AND PLANETARY DISTANCES.  In the two preceding lectures I have considered the figure and mag-  nitude of the earth and the laiv of gravitation. I shall this evening  call your attention to the method of determining the solar parallax  and planetary distances.  One of the first wants of astronomy was, to ascertain the distances  of the moon, sun, and planets from the earth. It was long, however,  before any considerable progress was made in the solution of this  important problem. The first and indispensable requisite for solving  Â«SmitliODkn Ecpoi-t for lS53,.page 161.   ON ASTRONOMY. 115  it, viz : the size of the earth, was wanting. The instrnraental means  known to the ancients were insufficient to furnish the elements of the  calculation.  Aristarchus, of Samos^ in the third century before the Christian era,  instituted observations for the purpose of determining the relative  distances of the sun and moon from the eartli. He wrote a treatise  upon the subject which has come down to modern times. Hismetliod  was to observe the angular distance of the moon from the sun at the  time when the moon appeared just half illuminated. This method, as  a preliminary one, is ingenious, and worthy of a passing notice.  Thus, in figure 10,    when the one-half of the moon is illuminated, the angle EMS will  be a right angle. If the angle M B S is accurately measured, the  angle at S will be known, and we shall have this proportion :  E M : E S : : sin. E S M : sin. E M S = 1.  This was the substance of Aristarchus' method. The lines of the  angles are known, and this makes known the relative distances of the  sun and moon.  The measurements of Aristarchus must have been very inaccurate.  He concluded that the sun was nineteen times more distant than the  moon. We now know the sun to be about four hundred times more  distant than the moon, which shows how extremely wide of the truth  this ancient determination was ; and yet Ptolemy, four centuries later,  adopted the determination of Aristarchus, and, combining it with  observations of his own, or more probably those of Hipparchus, com-  puted the sun's parallax to be three minutes, which is more than  twenty times its true value. The parallax of three minutes would place  the sun at only one-twentieth of its real distance. This conclusion of  the great Alexandrian astronomer appears to have been adopted down  to the time of Kepler, including Copernicus and Tycho Brahc. Kep-  ler's researches on the orbit of Mars led him to conclude that the  sun was at least three times more remote than Ptolemy had supposed.  But it is time to explain the method by which modern astronomers  have determined the distances of the planetary bodies within narrow  limits of error. And here it may be remarked that the relative dis-  tances of the planets from the sun were quite accurately known long   116   LECTURES   before any absolute distance was determined. The periodic time of the  several planets was very easily and very early known. And Kepler's  Third Law at once determined all the relative distances. Taking the  earth's distance from the sun as the unit of measure, v/e readily obtain  all the others in terms of this by the following proportion :_  F^: p^ : : 1 : d^ ; in which P represents the periodic time of the  earth, p that of the planet, and d the distance of the planet^ which  is the only unknown term.  The radius of the earth being known, the absolute distance of a  body is determined by its parallax. This depends upon the solution  of a plain triangle, and, in point of principle, the problem is precisely  the same as that of determining the distance across a river by means  of measurements made on one of its banks. Thus, in fig. 11,    *i+   E M', in which the first three terms   if we suppose E to be the earth, M' the moon in the horizon as seen  from the station 0, then M' E will be the horizontal parallax.  Now, if this parallax is known, which is simply the semi-diameter of  the earth seen from the moon, then knowing E the radius of the  earth, and the right angle E M', we have in the triangle E M' all  the angles and one side to find E M' the distance of the moon, which  is done by the proportion :  Sin. E M' 0: radius:: E  are known.  Again : Suppose the moon to be at M, let and 0' be two stations  in the same meridian, whose latitudes are known, which makes known  the angle at the centre E 0'. The object is to find the distance  E M. To do this, we want the observed zenith distances Z M and  Z' 0' M, which will make known their supplements E M and E 0'  M ; then in the quadrilateral figure E M 0', having already three  of the angles, we can easily obtain the fourth M 0', by subtracting  the sum of the three, which are known, from four right angles. With  all the angles and the two sides E and E 0' it is a simple trigno-  metrical problem to compute the distance E M. The radii of the  earth being known, the only error in the result will depend upon the  determination of the latitudes and the zenith distances. But, with  the instrumental means now at command, these errors are extremely  small. The angle M 0' may also be determined by observed distances   ON ASTRONOMY. 117  of the moon from some star in the vicinity. This method is applicable  to the moon, to Venus in conjunction, and to Mars in opposition. We  shall again have occasion to refer to it. The strict mathematical  treatment of the subject is quite elementary, but, to avoid tedious-  ness, I shall omit further reference to it.  The moon's mean distance from the earth is found, by measure-  ments of this kind, to be very nearly 240,000 miles. Herschel gives,  more exactly, 237,000.  But the great problem is, to determine the distance of the sun from  the earth. This, which gives the means of expressing the distance of  all the planets in miles, the British Astronomer Royal pronounces to  be the grandest problem in astronomy. It is solved by two different  methods. One is by observations on the planet Mars in opposition,  when it is, of course, nearest to the earth ; or on the planet Venus  when in conjunction, and also nearest to the earth. The other is by  the transits of Venus across the sun's disc,  I have already stated that the relative distances of all the planets  from the sun have been known, with considerable accuracy, since the  time of Kepler. It only remains to find the absolute distance of one,  and then, as the periodic times are known with great precision,  Kepler's Third Law will furnish all the other distances.  The semi-diameter of the earth, seen from the sun, subtends an  angle of a little more than 8^\", (8. \"6.) This is the sun's horizontal  parallax. It reduces the earth, as seen from the sun, to less than  one-half of the apparent diameter of Jupiter, as seen from the earth.  To appreciate the delicacy of this problem, it must be borne in mind  that an error of one second of arc in the parallax involves an error  of about 12,000,000 of miles in the distance of the sun. Moreover,  one second of arc is an extremely small quantity. None but the most  perfect instruments can pretend to measure it directly. The j-qVo  part of an inch, as any one will perceive, is an extremely small quan-  tity to deal with. But a circle must have nearly 18 feet radius in  order that 1\" may occupy the space of j oVir P<'^rt of an inch. Kepler  found reason to reduce the solar parallax from 3', as given by Ptolemy,  to 49\", which necessarily placed the sun at nearly four times the dis-  tance assigned by his great predecessor. And yet Kepler's measure  was only one-sixth part of the true distance.  To settle this question, or at least with the hope of getting a nearer  approximation, tlie French Academy, in 1672, sent Richer to Cayenne,  in South America, to mnke observations on the parallax of Mars in  opposition, while Cassini made contemporaneous observations at Paris.  by computation based on these observations the sun's parallax was  reduced to 9\". 5 as the probable value, which removed the sun to five  times the distance adopted by Ke[)ler.  Flamsteed compared his own observations on Mars with those of  Richer, and deduced 10\". With the hope of obtaining still nearer  results, Halley visited the island of St. Helena to observe the transit  of the planet Mercury across the sun's disc in 1677, October 28, but  the result was not satisfactory. He was inclined to adopt 15\" as the  true value.  The celebrated astronomical expedition of La Caille to the Cape  of Good Hope, in 1750, had for one of its objects to observe the   118   LECTURES   planet Mars in opposition, contemporaneously with Cassini in Paris,  Wargentin in Stockholm, and others in the north of Europe. These  observations gave for the parallax of the sun 10\". 4 nearly. The  parallax of Mars was about 25\".  The method by which the results were obtained will be understood   Fig. 12    by a reference to figure 12. S on the left is the position of the sun,  E the earth, M Mars in opposition. The stations of Wargentin at  Stockholm and La Caille at the Cape of Good Hope were nearly on  the same meridian. Let them be represented by and 0', their  latitudes being; known. Then in the quadrilateral figure E 0' M,  the angle at E is known by the latitudes ; the angles at and 0' are  known by the observed zenith distances Z M and Z' 0' M. These  three angles would make known the angle at M. But to avoid the  possible errors in determining the first three it is better to obtain  M by direct observation. Its value will serve as a test of the cor-  rectness of the other angles. This angle at M is most accurately  found by measuring the apparent distance, at each station, be-  tween Mars and some star near it which passes the meridian at  nearly the same time. At this distance would be S M; at 0'  it would be S' 0' M. The angle at M is the difference between these  two. For, on account of the great distance of the star, S and 0' 8'  are parallel ; and therefore S M = X 0'; but this latter being  exterior to the triangle 0' X M, we have X M 0' = X 0'â€” X 0' M ;  hence the angle at M is equal to the difference between the observed  distances of the star from Mars. The radii of the earth E and E 0'  being known, it is easy to compute the distance E M, the distance of  Mars from the earth. It will now be very easy to find E S, the distance  of the sun from the earth. From Kepler's Third Law we know that the  relative distances of the earth and Mars from the sun are as 100: 152  nearly ; that is, if the earth's distance were divided into 100 equal  parts the distance from the sun to Mars would be 152 of those parts,  and the distance from the earth to Mars in opposition would be 52 of  the same parts. But the foregoing process gives us the absolute value of  those 52 parts, and hence we can by a simple proportion find the value  of the 100 parts between the earth and sun. Let m .= the number of  miles in E M; then to find the number in E S, we have 52 : 100 : : m:  ES; orES= ^  The observations of La Caille and Wargentin were made on the 6th  of October, 1Y51. They gave for the parallax of Mars 24\". 7, for that  of the sun 10\". 4, and for the distance of the sun a little more than   ON ASTRONOMY. 119  76,000,000 of miles. These results agreed pretty nearly witli those  derived from the observations of Richer, Cassini, and Flamsteed, three-  quarters of a century earlier.  In 1760 Mayer, from analytical equations involved m the lunar  theory, deduced a value for the sun's par. r= 7\". 8.  But the transit of Venus was now near at hand, which alone could  satisfactorily solve this great problem. Dr. Halley was the first to  perceive and urge the importance of the passage of Venus over the sun  for this purpose. As early as 1716 he called the attention of astronomers  to the two transits which were to occur in 1761 and 1769, and most  earnestly urged them not to neglect so precious and so rare an oppor-  tunity of determining the planetary distances of the solar system. If  these opportunities were neglected the like would not again occur for  more than a century.  The transits of Venus invariably occur in June or December â€” those  at the ascending node in June, at the descending, in December. The  intervals between them are 8 years and 105^, then 8 and 121^, then 8  and lOoA, and so on successively in that order.  The transit of 1639, December 4, was observed by Horrox and  Crabtree, two young men engaged in astronomical studies, in seclu-  sion, as Grant says, in one of the northern counties of England.  They, by good fortune, (for the time of the transit was not accurately  known,) had ''the privilege of witnessing a phenomenon which human  eyes had never before beheld, and which no one was destined again to  see till more than a hundred years had passed away.\"  In anticipation of the transit of June 6, 1761, encouraged by the  earnest appeal of Dr. Halley, several European governments and  learned academies sent scientific commissions to different parts of  the earth to observe it. The English sent Dr. Maskelyne to St.  Helena, Mason and Dixon to the Cape of Good Hope. The French  Academy sent Pingre to the island of Rodrigues, in the Indian Ocean.  The Russians sent Chappe to Tobolsk, in Siberia, and Rumouski to a  station near Lake Baikal, on the Mongolian frontier. All the observa-  tories in Europe were put in requisition.  I shall here explain the method by which the sun's parallax is de-  termined by the transit of Venus. At different stations on the earth  the planet will be seen to traverse the sun's disc in different lines, and  will occupy unequal times. As the relative motions of Venus and the  sun are accurately known, the duration of the transit will show the  particular chord along which it passed. The two chords, as seen by  two observers favorably situated, being known, will make known the  perpendicular distance between them. This perpendicular distance is  then compared witli the diameter of the earth or some known part of  that diameter, and at once gives tlie sun's parallax. The peculiar  advantage of this method is, that the distance between the two ap-  parent chords traversed by the planet is more accurately known by  the difference of times than by any direct micrometrical measurement.  This process will be easily understood by reference to fig. 13, where  A B re{)resents the earth, V Venus, and S the sun. For the most  successful result, the stations A and B should be at the extremities of  a diameter perpendicular to the phme of the ecliptic. At A Venus  will be seen to traverse the chord E n L, at B the chord D m H.   120 LECTURES  Now, by observing tlie instant of the several contacts of the limb of  Venus with that of the sun, the exact time in which the centre of the  planet traverses the chord will be known. The mean diameter of the  sun is 32' 3\" nearly, or 1,923\". By the known angular velocities of    the two bodies the time of traversing the diameter becomes known.  Calling t the computed time of traversing the diameter, i' the ob-  served time of traversing the chord, we shall find the number of  seconds in the chord by the proportion t : t' '. : 1,923\" : the number of  seconds in the chord. By drawing radii from S to E and D we readily  find S n and S m from the right-angled triangles S w E and S m D,  and hence n mthe perpendicular distance between the chords; that is,  we shall know the number of seconds subtended by the line m n, as  seen from the earth. We can also compare m n with A B, they be-  ing parallel lines in the same plane perpendicular to the plane of the  ecliptic. Seen from V, these lines subtend the same angle. Their  relative lengths must, therefore, be as their distances. But it is known  that â€¢y ?i : V A : : 72 : 28 nearly ; hence, we have 72 : 28 : : iw w : A B.  But we have determined the number of seconds subtended by m n as  seen from the earth; this proportion, then, gives the number of  seconds subtended by A B, seen at the same distance; that is, as seen  from the sun. We then have the angular diameter of the earth as  seen from the sun. One-half of this is the long-sought element in  astronomy, the sun's horizontal parallax. On account of the great  importance of this process, and the great interest which always at-  taches to the transit of this planet, I have ventured to give the details  which are necessary to appreciate the grounds upon which the result  rests. It is proper to remark, before leaving this paint, that the two  stations A and B cannot well be at the extremities of a diameter, nor  will it often happen that the right line joining them will be perpen-  dicular to the plane of the ecliptic. But^ what comes substantially to  the same thing, the line joining the stations will always be known,  and can easily be reduced to an equivalent perpendicular one, so that  the accuracy of the final result will scarcely be impaired by this cir-  cumstance.  The only observation of that transit made on the American conti-  nent, so far as I am aware, was by Professor John Winthrop, of  Harvard University. The transit came on early on the morning of  June 6. For the purpose of a favorable station Mr. Winthrop re-  paired to St. John's, in New Brunswick. His observations were com-   ON ASTRONOMY. 121  mnnicated to Mr. James Short, of London, and, with others, were  published in the transactions of the Royal Society for 1764. From  the discussion of seventeen observations made at different places Mr.  Short found the parallax to be 8\". 6.  The same observations were discussed by Mr. Thomas Ilornsby,  professor of astronomy at Oxford. His result is 9/'7, more than 1\"  greater than Short's. Pingre's computations gave 10\". 1. Rumouski,  8\". 3. On account of such large discrepancies these results were not  very satisfactory.  But another transit was to occur June 3, 1769 ; and renewed and  more extended preparations were made to secure the best possible  observations. Scientific societies and enlightened governments united  their efforts to establish stations in distant parts of the earth most  favorable for observation.  Besides the observations of Dr. Maskelyne at the Greenwich  observatory, and many others in England, the Royal Society, with the  aid of the government, sent out the famous expedition of Capt. Cook  to the South Seas, where the transit was observed by Mr. Green, the  astronomer, by Captain Cook, and Dr. Solander, the botanist of the  expedition.  Another commission, consisting of Messrs. Wales and Dymond, was  sent to Hudson's Bay ; while Mason and Dixon, who had observed  the transit of 1761 at the Cape of Good Hope, observed this in  Ireland. And still another, under the direction of Mr. Call, was sent  to Madras.  The French Academy sent Pingre to St. Domingo, and the Abbe  Chappe to California, both of whom had observed the preceding  transit^ the former in the Indian ocean, the latter in Siberia. Chappe  made his observation at the village of St. Joseph, in California, and,  lingering a short time to complete some observations for the longitude  of the place, was seized with an epidemic and died on the 1st of  August following. His observations were preserved and sent to Paris  by one of his assistants.  The Academy of St. Petersburg took the most enlightened interest  in the event, and sent astronomers to three different stations in Lap-  land, to one on the banks of the Lena, to another on the shores of  the Caspian, and to several places in the interior of Asia.  The King of Denmark sent Father Hell, professor of astronomy in  Vienna, to Wardhus, at the northern extremity of Norway. Lanman  went to Cajanebourg, in Finland.  In this country the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia,  under the lead of Dr. Rittenliouse, took the most active and conspicu-  ous part in this f^nterprise, which united the astronomical labors of  all countries. As the time for preparation drew near tlie society  appointed commissions to make observations in the three separate  places : one at Norriston, (now Norristown,) the residence of Ritten-  liouse, seventeen miles northwest of Philadelphia; one in Philadelphia,  and one near Cape Henlopcn. Dr. Rittenhouse had the principal cliarge  of the first station, Dr. Evving of the second, and Mr. Biddle of the  third. The liveliest interest was felt in the subject. The day was  remarkably fine, and the observers were able to get excellent observa-  tions.   122 LECTURES  This transit was also observed by Professor Winthrop, of Cambridge,  who had observed the previous transit in New Brunswick, and by Dr.  West of Providence. Observations were also made by the Earl of  Stirling, at Baskenridge, in New Jersey, and by Captain Holland near  Quebec.  Several valuable papers, devoted to the record and discussion of  these observations, will be found in the transactions of the American  Philosophical Society for 1*769, and many in the transactions of the  Royal Society of London for 1769 and 1770.  Professor Hornsby, of Oxford, who had computed the sun's parallax  from the observations of 1761, computed the same from five or six of  the best observations of 1769. But the most complete discussion of  the subject was by Lalande, who, by the close of the year 1769, had  collected a great number of observations, and discussed them in the  most elaborate manner. His results were published in the Gazette of  France, in January, 1770.  In consequence of the unfavorable state of the weather only two of  the northern stations furnished full and complete observations, viz :  Wardhus and Cajanebourg. And, unfortunately, there was strong  reason to suspect that those at Wardhus, by Father Hell, were not  genuine. There was a delay and a reluctance in giving them to the  public, which much required explanation. And, after the fullest  investigation, there was reason to believe that some of them, at least,  were interpolations.  The close agreements of the computed results of observations, most  widely separated, taken two and two, gave assurance of a close  approximation to the truth. The following were obtained by Lalande :  California and Hudson Bay.. 8\". 56  Hudson Bay and Otaheite = 8\", 55  California and Otaheite 8\". 53  Wardhus, Cajanebourg, and Otaheite 8\". 62  The result of an immense amount of calculation by himself, Lexell,  Euber, Pingre, and Durejour, gave, 8\". 5; 8\". 7; 8\". 8. In England,  Hornsby found 8\". 8, Maskelyne 8\", 7, Smith 8\". 6. As a mean of all the  results, 8\". 6 was adopted, which is the same as Short obtains from the  observations of 1761. The importance of arriving at the nearest tenth  of a second will be seen by considering that one-tenth of a second in  parallax corresponds to about 1,000,000 miles in the sun's distance.  \"Such,\" says Lalande, in closing his history of this astronomical  event, \" such is the result of this celebrated transit of Venus, which  has occasioned so many voyages and so many volumes, and which has  taught us, much better than we knew before, the extent of our  universe, or at least of our solar system. This transit may be re-  garded as one of the memorable epochs of the astronomy of the  eighteenth century.\"  But succeeding astronomers were far from being content to adopt,  without further inquiry, the foregoing conclusion.  Encke, the eminent veteran astronomer of Berlin, has re-examined  and most elaborately collated and discussed all the observations made  at both the transits of 1761 and 1769, and given to the public the  results in two volumes, published, the one in 1822, the other in 1824.   ON ASTRONOMY. 123  From the transit of lYOl he finds P =: 8\". 53  From the transit of 1769 he finds P = 8\". GO   Mean P = 8\". 5 7  The sun's distance is therefore very nearly 95,300,000 miles. From  this all the other planetary distances are easily obtained by Kepler's  Third Law. Airy, in^his Lectures on Astronomy, puts the distance  at 95,500,000, with a probable error of not more than 500,000 miles.  It is worthy of remark, as showing that all true methods are in  harmony with each other, that Professor Burg, in 1824, following the  footsteps of Mayer, deduced the solar parallax from analytical in-  vestigations of the Lunar Theory, and found for a result 8\". 62, very  nearly coincident with that of Encke. Laplace had obtained, in the  same way, 8\". 61, a result almost identical with that of Burg.  These remarkable coincidences of analysis with observation in the  remote and untrodden fields of science furnish, as Laplace suggests,  one of the most striking proofs of universal gravitation. â€¢  Before bringing these remarks to a close, I must call your attention  to one other effort to approximate still nearer to this i'undamental  element in the solar system, an effort recommended by the ablest  astronomers, at home and abroad, and deemed worthy of the combined  labor of different countries. I refer to the United States naval astro-  nomical expedition to the southern hemisphere during the years 1849,  1850, 1851, and 1852, under Lieutenant J. M. Gilliss.  In 1847 Dr. Gerling, a distinguished astronomer and mathema-  tician of Marburg, in Germany, called the attention of astronomers  to the importance of repeating the observation on Mars in opposition,  and especially of making observations on Venus during the inferior  conjunction, for the more exact determination of the sun's parallax.  Pie suggested reasons for believing that, with the increased power  and accurac}^ of instruments, together with the delicate and refined  methods of observation now in use, most valuable results, additional  to any hitherto realized, might be obtained. He particularly urged  the importance of observations on Venus, which had not heretofore  been rendered available for this purpose. The principle of this will  be understood by reference to figure 14.   Fi(j. M    Two observers at and 0', by observation obtain the angle at  Venus, viz : V 0', in the same manner as before given in the case  of MarSj from which the distance E V can be computed. The planet   124 LECTURES  being within two or three degrees of the sun, this distance will differ  but little from E V. The horizontal parallax of Venus will then be  readily found. -  But the parallax of Venus and the sun will be inversely as their  distances. By Kepler's Third Law we should have â€”   SE ;   ; SV :   : 5U : 37 nearly.   Whence S E :   ; V E :   : : 511 : 141   or 51^ :   14i :.   . Par. Venus : Par, Sun.   In this proportion the terms are all known except the last, and  hence we have the sun's parallax.  The letter of Dr. Gerling to Lieutenant Gilliss was in anticipation  of the publication of his views in Germany. Lieutenant Gilliss  promptly brought the subject to the notice of our ablest astronomers,  and, with their hearty concurrence, enlisted Congress, the government  and the Smithsonian Institution in the enterprise.  The manner in which the expedition was undertaken and carried  out reflects the highest credit upon the ability and untiring energy  of Lieutenant Gilliss. The very moderate appropriation of $5,000  was authorized by Congress to enable the Secretary of the Navy to  defray the expenses of the expedition. Furnished with instruments  fitted expressly for the expedition, viz : two telescopes, a larger and  smaller, equatorially mounted ; a meridian circle, of large size and  exquisite finish; clock and chronometers; and two assistants, Messrs.  MacRae and Hunter, Lieutenant Gilliss, by order of the Secretary of  the Navy, repaired to Santiago de Chile, and erected his observatory  so as to commence observations in December of 1849, which were con-  tinued till September of 1852. By previous arrangement, simultaneous  observations on both Venus and Mars were to be made at the Wash-  ington observatory, under the direction of Lieutenant Maury. It was  expected also that other observers, both in this country and Europe,  would, as far as possible, co-operate in a work in which all astrono-  mers were alike interested.  On the return of the expedition the vast mass of observations were  placed in the hands of Dr. B. A. Gould, jr.^ for reduction and discus-  sion. The well known ability of Dr. Gould gave assurance that  nothing would be wanting to insure the most accurate results. The  laborious undertaking has been accomplislied, and the result published  in the third volume of the Naval Astronomical Expedition. The  parallax thus obtained from purely American observations, and by a  method entirely new, at least so far as the observations on Venus are  concerned, agrees very nearly with those obtained by the transit of  Venus, viz: 8\". 5. If we cannot say that our own astronomers have  attained a closer approximation to the truth than had before been  reached, which could hardly be expected, we can say that by a new  and independent method they have added a most valuable confirma-  tion to results before obtained. It is not too much to say that this  enterprise, in its conception and consummation, reflects honor upon  \"the scientific chaiacter of our country, and will be highly appreciated  wherever astronomical science is cultivated.  The next two transits of Venus will be on December 8, 1874, and   ON ASTRONOMY. 125  DecemlDer 6, 1882. It may be expected that American astronomers  will take an important part in the observation of these transits.  Of these two transits, that of 1882 will be the more favorable to an  exact determination. In a very interesting paper communicated to  the Royal Astronomical Society of London, in May, 1857, the astrono-  mer points out the special advantages which the United States will  possess for making accurate observations.  In the first place, the two regions of country most favorable for  observation are the United States and a portion of the Antarctic land  discovered by Captain Wilkes, of the United States navy. In the  second place, we have a large number of observatories situated at  such convenient distances that any local cloudiness which might pre-  vent observations at some stations would not affect others. In the  third place,, we have the great and peculiar advantage of an extended  system of magnetic telegraphs by which the clocks and chronometers  of all the stations might easily be connected so that all the observations  might be made by one clock, say that of Washington.  Humanly speaking, therefore, he remarks^ we may say that the  probabilities for the accurate and efficient observation of these phe-  nomena in the United States are vastly superior to any that could  have been reckoned on in any former time, or to any that could now  be anticipated in any other region.  SIDEREAL ASTRONOMY.  In my last lecture I discussed the methods of determining planetary  distances, first by finding the sun's distance from the earth, and then,  by means of Kepler's Third Law, computing the distances of the other  planets. The distance of the sun I stated to be 95,300,000 miles, with  a probable error of not more than half a million of miles. This pro-  portional error, and no more, will run through all the measures of  planetary distances. In this respect all has been done, or nearly all,  that can be done before the next transits of Venus in 1874, December  8, and 1882, December 6.  I shall, this evening, invite your attention to the subject of Sidereal  Astronomy. A glorious and an inspiring sight it is to look at the  starry heavens. So vast, so brilliant, so pure, they seem to raise the  soul to diviner contemplations than any scene which pertains to earth.  The first impression on looking at the heavens is, that the stars are  absolutely innumerable, but on a more careful consideration we be-  come satisfied that this first impression is erroneous. If the attempt  is actually made to number them, it will be found that not more than  about 3,000 can be seen at any one time by the naked eye. The whole  number thus visible in the heavens does not probably exceed 6,000  or 7,000.  Very early in the history of astronomy the stars were distributed  into groups called constellations, to which particular names were given,  depending upon some fancied resemblance between the configuration  of the stars and the form of the objector animal from which the name  was taken. Thus we have the constellation of the Great Bear, the  Little Bear, the Eagle, the Swan, the Lyre^ &c. These constellations   126 LECTUfiES  are convenient in reference to a general description of the heavens.  The more conspicuous stars have individual names as Sirius, Procyon,  Regulus^ &c.  The principal classification of stars, however, is in reference to their  magnitudes. But we must here bear in mind that the stars have no  assignable area or size. Tbey have no measurable disc, like the plane-  tary bodies. The stars of the first magnitude, when viewed with a good  telescope under favorable atmospheric circumstances, sharpen down  to a mere brilliant point. The classification is really based on  hrigJdness ; and stars of the first magnitude are simply the brightest  stars. Any one on looking at the heavens on a clear, moonless night,  will be able to distinguish many degrees of brightness between Sirius,  the brightest star in the heavens, and one that is barely visible to the  naked eye. It would not be difficult, perhaps, to select twenty stars  within these limits, which twenty different persons, without any con-  cert, would arrange in ihe same order. And this oaly shows how  quickly and how truly the eye discriminates slight shades of differ-  ence in brightness. Astronomers have, however, divided the stars  visible to the naked eye into six classes, and the telescopic stars into  ten additional ones, making sixteen in all. Stars of the 15th and  16th classes are test objects for the best telescopes which have been  made. It must not, however, be supposed that there is any very well  defined difference between the fiaintest star of the first magnitude and  the brightest of the second. These will not differ more from each  other than several of the stars of either class.  While it is very easy to arrange the stars in the order of their  brightness, it is not easy to determine how much they differ the one  from the other. Many attempts have been made to ascertain photo-  metrically, (that is, by measuring in some way the quantity or intensity  of light,) hoio much the light of Sirius, for instance, exceeds that of  Aldebaran, or any medium star of the first magnitude. These efforts  have extended to the comparison of a star of the Gth magnitude with  Sirius, and, again, Sirius with the moon and the sun. Researches  upon this subject are attended with many difficulties, and the results  cannot, of course, be considered very exact, and yet they afford toler-  able approximations to the truth. From comparisons which have  been made by different methods and by different persons, it is concluded  that the light of Sirius is fully equal to three times that of a star of  medium first class magnitude ; in other words, three first class stars  of the brightness of Aldebaran or Regulus, united, would only make  one of Sirius. The comparison being restricted to medium stars  of their respective classes, one of the first class is equal to four of the  second, eight of the third, and one hundred of the sixth.  Astronomers have agreed to place in the first class not more than  23 or 24 of the brightest stars ; in the second, 50 or 60 ; in the third,  about 300. Beyond the third class the numbers increase with great  rapidity. The whole number which have been accurately catalogued,  down to the seventh class inclusive, is about 15,000. Descending to  the telescopic classes, the numbers have become immensely great.  Struve, whose researches have been specially directed to this branch of  astronomy, concludes that the number of stars situated in Bessel's   ON ASTRONOMY. 127  zone, extending 15Â° on each side of the equator, which were visible  in Herschel's 20-fbot reflector, amounted to more than 5,800,000.  But this zone covers only about one-quarter of the heavens, and is by  no means that portion which is tlie richest in telescopic stars. The  great belt known as the Milky Way presents vast regions where the  minute stars are incomparably more dense than in Bessel's zone. To  say, ti en, that the whole number of stars visible in the telescope  amounts to many millions, is but an imperfect and inadequate state-  ment of the fact. We might still say, the half is not told us. But,  tlien^ turn away from the contemplation of single, scattered stars, and  look at the close clusters, of which there are so many in the heavens,  where many thousands of minute stars are so densely crowded together  that the very best powers of the telescope are required to separate  them. If they were thrown together, a million of visible stars would  scarcely occupy so large a space in the heavens as the sun's disc.  Then, from these stars, which are separately and distinctly visible,  look again at the \"star dust,\" as Herschel calls it, which gives a  general illumination to the Milky Way, and is visible only in the  aggregate, and which yet dimly shadows forth tlie existence of indi-  vidual orbs more numerous than all that are seen. Who, then, shall  count the stars, or tell the number thereof? Down to this time more  than 100,000 have been accurately catalogued. Lalande's Catalogue,  republished by the British Association, in 1837, alone contains 47,390.  Sidereal astronomy presents many points of interest. It may be  asked, what the stars are, and where they are, and wliether they are  unchangeably the same? Are they subjected to any law of motion?  Is there any bond of union between them ? Do they tell us anything  of time and space, of creative power and infinite intelligence, that we  shoidd not have known without them ? To some of these questions  we shall advert this evening. Others of them belong to after ages in  the world's history.  Following out the plan which I have proposed to myself in these  lectures, I shall first endeavor to show how we arrive at some esti-  mate of the distances of the stars. I have, in the previous lecture^  explained the method of finding the dimensions of the solar system,  in miles. The distance of the nearest fixed star is so vast that we  shall best express it in terms of the velocity of light. But if I tell  you that light moves at the rate of 192,000 miles in a single second  of time, you will very naturally ask me how this can be known. So  extraordinary a statement certainly ought not to be credited but upon  good and sufficient grounds. This problem is one of so much interest  in itself, and so needful to our progress, that I shall venture to give a  few moments to its illustration before proceeding to discuss the  distances of the stars.  The velocity of light is known by three separate means : 1. By  the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. 2. By the aberration of light. 3.  By direct experiment.  Immediately on the discovery of the telescope by Galileo, in 1610,  his attention was drawn to the satellites of Jupiter, then lor the first  time seen. The)'- revolve round the primary in periods of from less  than two to more than sixteen days. Their periodic times were soon   128   LECTURES   determined witli considerable precision. But it was also found tli at  they presented remarkable inequalities. When the earth in her orbit  was receding from Jupiter, the periodic times were too long. On the  contrary, when she was approaching him they were too short. These  discrepancies were the occasion of much perplexity.  Arago, in his popular astronomy, gives to Lord Bacon the credit of  having first suggested that the inequalities might be due to the fact  that time was occupied in the transmission of light ; that the effect of  light was not, as had been supposed, simultaneous at all distances.  Roemer, an eminent Danish astronomer, was the first to urge this  fact as necessary in order to account lor the apparent irregularities.  Eesearches upon these satellites occupied the attention of eminent  astronomers for more than half a century. And it was not until after  the lapse of more than a hundred years from the time of their  discovery that their motions were fully explained ; and no explana-  tion was sufficient which did not involve the \" equation of light.\"  The subject will be easily understood by reference to fig. 15.    Let S be the sun, E E' the orbit of the earth, 1 1' a portion of the  orbit of Jupiter, s and s' the orbit of one of the satellites. The pri-  mary casts a shadow behind it in a direction opposite to the sun, by  which the satellites are often eclipsed. In some portions of the earth  the immersion and the emersion of the satellites can both be seen ; in  other positions only one of them. When the earth is at E and Jupi-  ter at I, the emersion of the satellite is seen at s. When the earth  has advanced in her orbit to E' and Jupiter to I', the emersion will be  seen at 6-'. While the earth is passing along the side of her orbit  approaching the planet the immersions are seen. While she is mo-  ving from the point of her orbit nearest to the planet the intervals  between the eclipse are too long ; and while returning from the most  remote to the nearest they are too short. And this difference, in the  course of a complete synodic revolution, amounted to more than 16|  minutes. It was at length found, by accurate calculation, that light  occupied 16 ra. 36 sec. in traversing the diameter of the earth's orbit,  or eight minutes and eighteen seconds in coming from the sun to us.  With this aUowance, the discrepancies between the computed and  observed times of tlie eclipse entirely disappeared. This result fixed  the velocity of light at about 192,000 miles per second.   ON ASTEONOMY.   129   But the foregoing result was not, perhaps, fully concurred in by  astronomers till Dr. Bradley, in 1725, discovered the aberration of  light, one of the most beautiful discoveries in the whole history of  science. Dr. Bradley, while prosecuting researches for the purpose of  detecting, if possible, the annual parallax of the stars, found that all  the stars were subject to an annual change of position, and that they  described orbits about their mean places having 40\" of arc for their  major axis. Those situated in the ecliptic moved backward and forward  in a straight line. In proportion as they are removed from the ecliptic  the minor axes of the orbits increased, while the major axes of all  remain the same. And, what is quite singular, they are all displaced  or projected forward in the direction of that point in the heavens  towards which the earth is at the moment moving. The true expla-  nation of this fact was far from being obvious. It was at length sug-  gested to Dr. Bradley, on an occasion of being rowed across the  Thames. He observed that the streamer, at the top of the mast, indi-  cated a change in the direction of the wind while the boat was getting  under way. He inquired of the boatmen what made the wind change  when the boat began to move ? They could give no explanation, but  said they had often observed it. But, on reflecting upon the subject. Dr.  Bradley explained it on the principle of the parallelogram of forces  The streamer would necessarily take the direction of the diagonal of a  parallelogram which should have for one side the velocity of the  wind, and for the other the velocity of the boat. This at once  explained, also^ the displacement of the star. It must appear in the  direction of the diagonal of a parallelogram which should have for  one side the velocity of the earth, and tor the other the velocity of  light.    E-   In figure 16, if E B represents that portion of the earth's orbit  which is described in one second of time, and E S the distance traversed  by light in one second of time, then the star which is really at S will  appear to be at S', determined by the parallelogram formed on E B  and E _S as sides. The angle S B S', which measures the displace-  ment, is called the aberration, and when largest is always equal to  20\" of arc. ^ \"With every star this maximum occurs twice in the  year, at the time when the line of direction of the earth makes a right  9   130   LECTUEES   angle with the visual ray from the star. In the triangle E B S' the  angle S' E B, very nearly equal to S E B, is always known from the  position of the star, the angle E S' B r=: S E S' is known hy ohser-  vation, E B = velocity of the earth, B S' = E S = velocity of light;  we then have sin. E S' B : sin. S' E B : : E B : B S'. But twice  in the year E S' B = 20\" and S' E B = 90Â°, we then have-  sin. 20\" : R : : vel. of earth : vel. of light ;  or, converting the R = sin. 90Â° in seconds and leaving off the sines,  we have â€”  20\" : 206265\" : : vel. of earth : vel. of light.  -TTi 11 1 -i i? T 1 J. 206265 X vel. of earth.  Whence the velocity oi light =: ^  If we introduce into this equation the velocity of the earth, which  is nearly nineteen miles per second, we shall obtain a result very  nearly equal to 192,000, as given by the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites.  The effect of aberration for the entire year will be seen by figure  17, where E E' E\", &c., is the earth's orbit, S the mean place of a  star, and S' S\" S\"', &c., the apparent orbit described by the star, or  the ellipse of aberration.  There is a third determination derived from direct experiment,  which is too important to be omitted in this connexion. In 1849, M.  Fizeau, of Paris, constructed a most ingenious apparatus, which had  the requisite delicacy for so difficult an experiment. The outline of  it is given in figure 18.    J y 18   -liL    s is a lamp, u a lens placed in a tube which serves to converge a  beam of light on m, a plane unsilvered glass, placed in a tube ; thei  glass m reflects the convergent beam of light to a focus at o. x is  lens which receives the light and refracts it into a parrallel beam x y;  at y is another lens, which converges it to a focus on the plane mirror w,  from which it is reflected directly back, passes again through the lens  y, thence through the lens x, thence through the unsilvered glass m,  and reaches the eye at e. At the point o, where the light is brought  to a focus, an opening is made in the tube in which the toothed  wheel c is made to revolve with great velocity by mechanism not  here represented. There is also a diaphragm placed across the tube,   ON ASTRONOMY. 131  directly behind the wheel, with a rectangular opening in it. The  form of the opening in the diaphragm and in the teeth of the wheel are  seen enlarged in a part of the wheel c' , figure 18. As the wheel c  revolves, the opening in the diaphragm is successively opened and  closed with great rapidity. If it were to be permanently open, then  the light from the lamp would fall upon the plane glass m, a portion  would be transmitted and a portion reflected, which latter portion  would pass through the lenses x and y, be reflected at n, return  again, fall a second time upon m, and be transmitted to the eye at e.  In this state of the apparatus the eye sees a bright point at the focus o.  The bright point continues visible until the velocity of the wheel c is  such that one of its teeth passes over the notch in the diaphragm and  thus prevents the reflected light from coming to the eye. The bright  point is then eclipsed. This will necessarily take place whenever the  time occupied by the tooth in passing the space of the notch is the  same as that required by light in going from o to n and returning.  When the velocity of the wheel becomes so great as to close and  open the notch again while the light is going and coming, the bright  point will reappear. As the rotary speed of the wheel increases, the  point will be successively eclipsed. The rotary velocity of the wheel  is registered by appropriate mechanism so as to mark with precision  the number of turns to a second, while the number of teeth in the  wheel will serve to determine the time in which one tooth passes the  notch. The distance between the stations was 8,633 metres, equal  to five and one-eighth miles nearly. The apparatus indicated the  time of traversing the double distance, or ten and two-third miles, to  be about y-^o o\" ^^ riro o^u <^f ^ second, which makes the velocity of light  very nearly the same as that given by the preceding methods. Physi-  cal science presents few more striking results than this of M. Fizeau.  From the near agreement of these three independent methods of  determining the velocity of light we may safely conclude that the  probable error is small. Light moves with the amazing velocity of  192,000 miles per second.  We shall now proceed to inquire into the distance of the fixed stars.  And we may state, in the outset, that the only means of arriving at  an indication of this is an annual change in the position of the star.  But there are certain changes which are dependent upon known causes  which must first be allowed for. These are refraction, aberration,  and nutation. The refraction varies with the altitude of the star ;  aberration for any particular star depends on the season of the year ;  nutation, (another fine discovery of Dr. Bradley, in consequence of  which the star describes a little ellipse about its mean place once in  about nineteen years,) depends upon the position of the nodes of the  moon's orbit. This inequality is due to the action of the moon upon  the spheroidal figure of the earth. The amount of these corrections  is well known. Now, if there is any change in the position of a star  over and above what is duo to the above causes it must be referred  either to its own proper motion or to the change of position of the  earth in its orbit. But these two are not liable to be confounded the  one with each other. The proper motion will be progressive from year  to year in the same direction. Any change due to the motion of the   132   LECTURES   earth will necessarily be periodic and the star must return to the  same place at the expiration of a year. A proper motion has been  detected in many of the stars, amounting in some to 4\" or 5\" in a  year.  Any change due to the motion of the earth is called the annual  parallax. The only means within the reach of astronomy of finding  the distance is by means of this parallax.  An obvious proof that the stars are immensely distant is that, except  under the severest possible scrutiny, they appear to hold the same  relative places at all seasons of the year. Our change of position^  involving a distance of nearly 200,000,000 of miles, dwindles down to  nothing in comparison with the line which extends from the earth to  the star.  In figure 19, let S be the sun, A E B the earth's orbit, and s a    star ; then the angle A s S, or the angle subtended by the radms ofl  the earth's orbit, as seen from the star, would be the annual parallax;  of the star. If this angle were so much as 1\", it would follow thati  the distance of the star must be 206,265 times the distance of the;  sun. In that case light would require more than 31 years m coming;  from the star to us. But in no case is the parallax of a star so large  as 1\". As Biot has remarked, \"an angle so large as \\\" could not  have escaped universal recognition.\" What we are now entitled to  say then is, that light from the nearest fixed star would require at least  more than 3| years to reach our earth. ^  There is no presumption that the stars are all equally distant. On  the contrary there is every probability that their distances are very:  unequal, and heu<3e that some stars of the first order of intrinsic splen-  dor appear faint from their vast distance. Huyghens, assuming that  Sirius was equal in intrinsic brightness to our sun, concluded from a  computation based upon the well known law that the intensity of light  diminishes inversely as the square of the distance, that Sinus must be  28,000 times more distant than the sun ; in other words that our sun  at that distance would appear no brighter than Sirius does now. But  this estimate of the distance, as we now know, is far too small. At  only that distance the parallax would be four times as great as that  of the nearest known star. Dr. WoUaston, by very ingenious photo-   ON ASTRONOMY.   133   metric measurements, concluded thatSirius must be 140,000 times more  distant than the sun. But even this is much within the true distance.  But let us glance at the actual measurements which have enabled  the astronomer, in some few cases at least, to sound the amazing depths  of the heavens.  The star j Draconis, of Flamsteed's catalogue, has a very large  proper motion, amounting to nearly 5\" annually. Under the suppo-  sition that those stars which have the greatest proper motion are  nearest to us, and therefore most favorable to researches on the par-  allax, this star was selected by Dr. Bradley for special observations,  with a view to detect this element. It had also the great advantage  of passing near the zenith of the Wansted observatory, by which the  troublesome irregularities of refraction would be avoided. He failed  to detect any parallax, but his labor was rewarded by the beautiful  discovery of the aberration of light. Bradley depended upon finding  a variation in the elements of right ascension and declination. But  this is by no means the most delicate test which can be applied for the  determination of a minute annual change in the position of the star.  Galileo was the first to suggest that where a large and a small star  are very close together the smaller star might appear faint from being  placed at a vastly greater distance than the larger. If this were not  always the case, of which there is no probability, it would be likely to  occur in some instances. Wherever this holds good the stars will  undergo an annual change in their relative positions, either approach-  ing and receding from each other^ or the one revolving about the other.  Thus, in figure 19, if we suppose s and s' to be two stars situated in a  right line from the sun and in the direction of the pole of the ecliptic,  as the earth goes round in her orbit A E B the star s may appear to  revolve round s', and it must do so if the radius of the earth's orbit  holds any assignable ratio to the distance of the nearer star. Thus,  when the earth is at A, s will appear at a in the distant heavens;  when the earth is at E the star will appear at e; the earth at B will  carry the star to h ; and hence while the earth goes round in the orbit  A E B the star S will appear to go round 6' in the curve a eh. No  instance has been discovered where this idea has been fully realized.  Nor indeed could any available results be obtained from it until a  very late period, for the want of instruments fitted to measure so small  an angle as the largest annual parallax. The micrometer in its dif-  ferent ibrms supplies this want. The manner in which very minute  angles are measured by this appendage to the telescope will be under-  stood by a reference to figure 22,  which is a rectangular frame  with a fine screw at each end  passing tlirough the frame and  attached to sliding pieces within  it. These sliding pieces carry  the spider lines a and 6, which  by turning the screws are made  to approach or separate from each other. Graduated circles are  fixed to the heads of the screws. Suppose one complete revo-  lution of the screw changes the position of the spider lines by 2' or   Fic^ 22    134 LECTURES  120\", and let the circles be divided into 360 parts, then one division  on the circle will correspond to one-third of a second between the  spider lines. This apparatus, called the micrometer, is placed in or  across the tube of the telescope near the eye piece. It is sometimes  furnished with a slip of metal just below the spider lines, which marks  the interval in seconds between them. The distance between two stars  or the diameter of a planet is measured by adjusting the instrument  so that the stars shall be bisected by the lines, or the disk of the planet  will lie exactly between them. The turns and divisions of the screw  which bring the lines together will give the angular distance sought  in this case to the one-third of a second. Large telescopes fitted with  micrometers are indispensable to researches upon the distances of the  fixed stars. The value of one turn of the screw is fixed by directing  the telescope to two well defined objects of a known angular distance  apart.  Special researches upon this branch of astronomy have been made  by Struve, Bessel, Peters, Henderson, Maclean and Groombridge.  In 1835 Struve, then of Dorpat, now of the Great Russian Obser-  vatory at Pulkowa, near St. Petersburg, commenced a series of obser-  vations on the bright star in the Lyre. This star has a very minute  companion at the distance of 43\". Struve was able to detect an annual  variation in this distance, from which he deduced the annual parallax  of a Lyrse to be 0\".261_, from which it follows that light would be  about fourteen years coming from that brilliant star to us. The light  which it sheds upon us to-night started on its career fourteen years ago.  But the researches of Bessel in connexion with the star 61 Cygni,  form an important epoch in the history of stellar astronomy. He  was furnished with a magnificent heliometer, made by Frauenhofer,  with a micrometer of the greatest delicacy. He brought to the re-  search an array of instrumental means which no previous astron-  omer had been able to command. His consummate skill as an observer,  in connexion with the exquisite instruments in his hand, enabled him  to furnish results which have commanded universal confidence. His  observations were commenced at Konigsberg in 1835, and continued  to 1840. His field of view is presented in figure 20, where S is the  double star 61, a and h are two  minute stars, situated nearly at  right angles from S, the former at  the distance of 7', the latter at 11';  the middle of the two stars S was  the point from which the distances  of a and h were measured. From  the configuration of the stars, if  S approached a, it would_, three  months later, approach h ; at the  expirationof another three months  it would have receded from Â«, and  then after the same interval, from  J). This, in fact, was the order  of change which was observed.  In other words, S revolved in a little orbit about its mean place. In    ON ASTEONOMY.   135   the discussion of his observations, on which, as Herschel remarks,  \" every imaginable cause of disturbance was taken into careful con-  sideration and its effects rigorously calculated,\" he reached the con-  clusion that the parallax of Gl Cygni was 0\".348.  From this we infer that light would reach us from this star in 9\\  years. This result of Bessel has received the most ample confirmation  by Peters of Pulkowa, who, in a series of observations, made in 1842  and 1843, with consummate address in the use of every refinement  which could insure accuracy, found the parallax of this same star to  be 0\".349, differing from the result of Bessel by only the yoVo of ^  second. Such a coincidence between the results of different observers,  with different instruments and in different places, cannot but inspire  great confidence in the conclusion to which they have come.  The star a Centauri, the brightest star in the southern constellation,  has been much observed with a view to its parallax ; first by Hen-  derson in 1832 and 1833, then by Maclean in 1839 and 1840, and  again in 1848, both at the Cape of Good Hope. The mean of the  results gives for the parallax of this star 0\".915, which places it nearer  to our system than any star whose parallax has been determined.  And yet light would be nearly four years in coming from this our  nearest stellar neighbor.  The parallaxes of the following stars have been proximately de-  termined. I give them in a tabular form, with their parallax, the  name of the observer, and the number of years required for light to  come from the star to us :   stars.   a Centauri  Do  Gl Cygni  a Lyrae  Sirius  1830 of Groombridge's Catalogue  I UrsEe Majoris  Arcturus  Polaris  Capella   Parallax.   0.915  0.918  0.348  0. 2G1  0.230  0. 226  0. 133  0. 127  0. 067  0.

The severest scrutiny of the bright star a Cygni, by the powerful in-  struments of Peters, shows absolutely no indication of any measurable  parallax.  We can now give at least a partial answer to the question, how far  off are the stars? An infant is born, and at the same time a beam of  light starts from the bright star in the Swan on its way to our distant  world. Tiie child pas.ses through the slow-recurring stages of life,  reaches manhood and old age, and lingers his fall century and dies ;  and the light has not yet reached us ! Such is the distance which we  vainly try to contemplate.   136 LECTURES  We may also give a partial answer to the question, how far oif may a  star be seen ? Photometric measurements, deemed reliable, show that  Sirius would be as bright as an ordinary star of the sixth magnitude  at ten times its present distance ; the light would then be 220 years  in coming to us. But Sir John Herschel's twenty-foot reflector, and  still more the great telescope of Lord Rosse, would bring out a star of  the sixth magnitude at seventy-five times its present distance. Hence  Sirius might be seen at 750 times the distance which now intervenes  between it and us. To traverse so vast a space light would require  the long period of 16,500 years ! But why should we stop here? No  law of the universe bars our progress. And yet, again, what were  the use of attempting to advance farther ? The steps become so vast  that we hesitate to take them. We labor under the oppressive convic-  tion that, if millions of them were taken, we reach no end. There is  every presumption in favor of the hypothesis â€” nay, there is positive  inductive reason for believing, that, from groups of stars and nebulfe,  light reaches the human eye which has been 100,000 years in its tire-  less flight from the distant verge of the universe.  From what we now know, can we then doubt that the stars which  beam efFulgently upon us, or merely twinkle from the serene depths  of ether, are great central suns ? Nay, that many of them are great  central suns, far surpassing our own in their intrinsic splendor?  Wollaston has shown, by photomdiscal measurements, in Herschel's  opinion, \" apparently unobjectionable,\" that the intrinsic splendor of  a Centauri is equal to nearly 2^ suns, and that Sirius is probably equal  to 63 suns. Such is the vastuess and the grandeur of the starry heavens.  We look upon the millions of those brilliant orbs, which, scattered  through illimitable space, light up the universe of God, and these  are but parts of His works ! What, then, do they tell us of time and  space, of infinite intelligence, and omnipotent power ! Well might  we ask with the patriarch, \"canst thou by searching find out God unto  perfection?\"  There is one other topic to which I shall briefly allude, it is that of  double stars. We here speak of stars connected together so as to form  a system, not of those which are only optically double, in consequence  of the two being nearly in the same direction. Of the double stars,  which evidently form systems of their own, some are binary, consist-  ing of two stars ; some triple, and others, perhaps, quadruple.  Sir William Herschel was the first to recognize the importance of  this particular branch of stellar astronomy, and the first to enter upon  it. He made a catalogue of 500 double stars, which were suspected  to have motions of revolution about each other. Since his time the  catalogue, by the labors of Struve, Peters, and others, has been  extended to 3,000. Two observed elements indicate amotion of revo-  lution of two stars, the one about the other, or both about their com-  mon centre of gravity. The first is a variation of the angular distance  between them, and the second is a progressive rotary movement in the  line joining them. Both these elements of position can be observed  with great precision. The first will tend to develop the form of the  orbit, the second the time of revolution. If the plane of the stellar  orbit should chance to be perpendicular to the visual ray, we shall see   ON ASTEONOMY.   137   it developed in its true form If that plane should coincide with the  visual ray, then, whatever the real form of the orbit, it would appear  to us to be a straight line. The com[)anion would make a transit  across the principal star, or be occulted by it every serai-revolution.  It is now well known that, in the binary systems, the stars revolve in  elliptical orbits. Of this class Sir John Herschel gives a catalogue of  15, in which the periodic times and tlie forms of the orbits have been  proximately determined. The periodic times vary from 31 to *736  years, y Leonis, not included in his catalogue, indicates a period of  1,200 years. Of these stars, some have completed more than a revo-  lution since their orbits were computed. One of the most interesting  of the double stars is y Virginis. The companion passed the peri-  helion of its orbit in 1836, when no telescope in Europe could sepa-  rate the two. The periodic time is 182 years, the major axis 3\". 5, the  orbit very elliptical.  Fig. 21 gives a view of the re- ^ Â»  spective positions of the companion  from 1830 to 1844.  These orbits of the double stars  furnish the most conclusive evi-  dence that the law of gravitation  controls the movement of the most  distant stars no less than the orbits  of the component members of our  own system. It is truly and em-  phatically the law of universal  gravitation, and binds together, in  the strictest sense, the material  universe of God.  Such are the methods by which  we ascend to the vast heights of sidereal astronomy, and such are the  lofty conceptions which it gives us of the works and attributes of the  Great Creator.    MEMOIE OE PEIESTLEY.  READ BEFORE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FRANCE BY M. CDVIER, JUNE 27^  1805.  [Translated by C. A. Alexander.]  [The discourses by which the French Academy of Sciences is accus-  tomed to commemorate its deceased members, whether native or for-  eign, constitute, it is known, a body of highly interesting biographical  and scientific literature. Far from being limited to encomium, as the  title of \"Eloges,\" by which they are usually called, might suggest,  they maintain a tone of candid criticism, and in dispensing justice to  scientific discoverers deal in enlarged and original views of science  itself. The names of their authors â€” of Delambre, Fourier, Cuvier,  Arago and others â€” would teach us to expect no less.  Those delivered by Arago, late perpetual secretary of the academy,  have been recently translated and published in England among the  works of that distinguished and lamented individual. A few others  may be found dispersed through the volumes of scientific periodicals  of Great Britain, but as these are little accessible to the general  reader, and as many have not been translated which well deserved  to be so, it has been thought that a more extended collection than has  yet appeared would not be unacceptable to the literary public.  In this view, a translation, not indeed of the whole series, but of  such as, having not been already published in this country, may  serve to give a connected and popular exposition of the progress of  science, has been undertaken at the suggestion of the Secretary of  the Smithsonian Institution ; and the proposed work will appear under  the auspices of the Institution, in so far, at least, as to guarantee the  correctness of its views and the fidelity of its execution.  As a specimen of the work, as well as for its own intrinsic interest,  the following memoir of one of the most original and ingenious pro-  moters of modern science, who closed his eventful life in our own  country^ is appended to the present report.]  Joseph Priestley, the subject of the present discourse, was an  English clergyman, whose important discoveries in physics occasioned  his being chosen a foreign associate of the Academy of Sciences of  Paris, and the National Institute lost no time in associating him with  itself by the same title.* As he belonged besides to most scientific  academies of his time, it may be that the homage which we this day  render him has been already oifered to his memory in all the great  capitals of the civilized world.  This unanimity of commendation will appear the more encouraging  * The Academy of Sciences, with its kindred bodies, having been suppressed by a decree  of the convention in 1793, was replaced in 1795 by the National Institute, divided at first  into classes, which, on the restoration of the monarchy, again received the name of acade-  mies. â€” Tr.   MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 139  to the friends of enlightenment, and attest more strikingly the irre-  pressible influence of true merit, when it is considered that he who  was its ohject used no address or management in securing it ; that,  on the contrary, his life was one of almost ceaseless controversy ; that  he seemed on all occasions to take pleasure in contesting the most ac-  credited opinions, and attacked without scruple the most cherished  interests of certain classes of men.  It is true that this excessive ardor in the assertion of his own ideas  drew upon him the bitterest resentments, exposed him to all sorts of  calumny, and more than once rendered him the victim of cruel perse-  cution. A mob, excited by the false reports of his enemies, snatched  from him in a single day the fruits of all his labors, and only by  withdrawing from his country did he succeed in baffling the fury of  his persecutors. But when his own countrymen seemed to forsake  him, there were others eager to offer him an honorable asylum. And  now, when the principal literary institution of a nation at war with  his own, tenders him through my voice the last sad tribute which it  owes to all its members, I see among the audience many to whom  Priestley has been heretofore opposed, who yet seem to join their suf-  frages with mine and crown by their generous concurrence the measure  of his triumph.  Science and philosophy will have nothing to fear from their bigoted  adversaries so long as such a recompense shall await the man who has  enlarged the noble edifice of our knowledge ; so long as genius shall  be regarded apart from its merely local relations, and the development  of new truths shall procure indulgence for any incidental waywardness,  singularity or even rashness of opinion ; for it must not be dissembled  that in matters of opinion Priestley has made himself liable to ex-  ceptions of this nature.  In effect, his history will exhibit him in the light, as it were, of two  different â€” I had almost said, two contrasted â€” individuals.  One, the circumspect observer of nature, confines himself to the  examination of objects which lie within the domain of experience,  subjects every procedure to a strict and cautious logic, indulges neither  in speculation nor prejudice, but seeking only truth, whatever it may  be, seldom fails to discover and to establish it in the most satisfactory  manner : the other shows us the adventurous theologian, who grap-  ples boldly with the most mysterious questions, rejects authority  however consecrated by the respect and belief of ages, and, abandon-  ing himself to the heat of controversy, with opinions formed in ad-  vance, evinces as much solicitude for the success as concern for tlie  validity or even consistency of his hypotheses. The former calmly  resigns his discoveries to the examination of the learned, and finds  them received without hesitation and his own merit acknowledged  without contradiction : the latter invests himself in the warlike  panoply of erudition and metaphysics, attacks with little discrimina-  tion whatever sect or dogma presents itself, and too often revolts  the conscience by the aggressive zeal with which he seems bent on  subduing it.  It is against the divine, the minister of peace, that all are in arms ;   140 MEMOIR OF PEIESTLEY.  he is accused of exciting animosity, arousing vengeance, and troubling  society. The physical inquirer, on the other hand, meets with in-  variable respect; every one acknowledges that, in the defence of truth,  he relies only upon reason, that his discoveries are directed solely to  the welfare of his fellow-men, and that his writings breathe nothing  but a spirit of candor and of modesty.*  Thoroughly to know Priestly, then, it is necessary that he should  be sketched under both these characters ; that the theologian, meta-  physician, and politician should be reproduced, no less than the inge-  nious physicist and associate of the National Institute. At the same  time there can be no mistake as to the comparative prominence which  should be given, on the present occasion, to one or the other, and as  little probably as to the interest which posterity is likely to attach to  them. He has himself somewhere remarked that, as a means of last-  ing renown, the labors of science are as far superior to all others as  the laws of nature to the organization of societies ; and that no states-  man who ever rose to power in Great Britain has approached in  celebrity its Bacons, Newtons, and Boyles ; a maxim somewhat exag-  gerated, perhaps, but which it would have been fortunate if he had  always kept before his own eyes. Priestley, however, is not the first  celebrated man, whose judgment has shown itself incapable of mas-  tering his character.  Mean while it is to be carefully noted that in no respect did his  divergent opinions influence his conduct, but that, with the exception  of the unmerited misfortunes which overwhelmed him in old age, the  whole course of his life was alike uniform and simple. The mere list  of his works would indicate as much; for, when it is known that he  produced more than a hundred treatises, no one can suppose that  society engrossed much of his time, or that his history can consist of  much more than an analysis of his writings.  He was born at Birstal-Fieldhead, near Leeds, in 1733. His father  was a cloth-dresser ; his first master a dissenting minister. After  several years study he obtained the situation of [tutor in the Belles  Lettresf] at the provincial academy of Warrington, and afterwards  became pastor of a congregation of dissenters at Leeds. Lord Shel-  burn, secretary of state and afterwards first marquis of Lansdowne,  under a sense of Priestley's merit [which had then been established  by his first discoveries] induced him to accept the position of [his  lordship's librarian and philosophic companion, with a salary of Â£250,  reducible to Â£150 for life should he quit the employment.] This con-  nexion was terminated, without loss of confidence or friendship on  either part, at the end of seven years, and Priestley resumed his pas-  toral functions among the dissenters at Birmingham. Here he  * Whether the contrast here presented be not pushed, in the spirit of antithesis, to too  great a length, will probably be differently decided, according to the previous views of the  reader. But that, in some of his metaphysical speculations and interpretations of propiiecy,  Dr. Priestley has laid himself open to the charge of temerity, will be denied by few ; nor is  it surprising that Cuvier should regret that such astonishing activity of intellect had not been  restrained to the paths of induction, where he himself had tbund so secure a footing. â€” Tr.  t The words within brackets are from Lord Brougham's \" Lives of Philosophers of the  iBmo of George III.\"   MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 141  remained eleven years, up to the time of the disturbances which com-  pelled him to quit that city and determined him to seek a refuge in  the United States. Such is the brief yet complete outline of his pri-  vate life ; the history of his works, as it is more important, must be  more extended.  The first of them were intended for the service of education, and an  English grammar, his earliest production, is still used in the schools  of Great Britain. His historic and geographic charts deserve to be  used everywhere for the ingenious manner in which they represent the  origin and fall of each State and the career of every celebrated man.  His lessons on history evince both the comprehension and knowledge  requisite for a profitable study of the revolutions of nations. Those  on oratory and criticism are recognized as useful guides to the exer-  cises of the young.*  This didactic form was that which he still employed in his first  works on physics ; his histories, namely, of electricity and optics, and  kis elements of perspective. The history of electricity was judiciously  timed, for it appeared just when Franklin, by the boldness and suc-  cess of his investigations, had thrown the brightest lustre around this  interesting branch of physics, and as all that had been done up to  that date was here presented in a clear and concise form, it was trans-  lated into several languages and first drew some notice in foreign  countries to the name of its author.  The ungrateful taslc, however, of recounting what had been done  by others was not long to limit the activity of Priestley. He proceeded  without loss of time to place himself in the line of j)hysical discoverers,  and it was chiefly by his researches into the difterent kinds of air that  he merited that title and established the most durable monument of his  own renown.  It had long been known that many bodies give out air and that  others absorb it under certain circumstances. It had been observed  that the air of neglected privies and of the bottoms of wells, with that  evolved by fermentation, extinguishes light and destroys animal life.  A light air, also, had been observed in the interior of mines, floating  mostly about the vaults of the passages, and kindling sometimes with  fearful explosions. The former had received the name oi' Jixed smd  the latter that of infiamrnable air. They are the same which we now  call carbonic acid gas and carhuretted-liydrogen. Cavendish had  determined their specific gravity ; Black had ascertained that it is  the fixed air which renders the alkalies and lime efiervescent ; and  Bergman had not been backward in detecting its acid properties.  Such was the state of knowledge in these particulars when Priestley  laid hold of the matter and treated it with a felicity altogether peculiar  to himself.  Happening to be lodged, at Leeds, next door to a brewery, he had  the curiosity to examine the fixed air which is exhaled from beer in  * Referring to these productions, Lord Brougham remarks : â€¢' It is difficult to imagme any-  thing more adventurous tiian tiie tutor of an academy afflicted with an incurable stutter,  and who devoted liis lime to tcaciiiug and theology, promulgating rules of eloquence to the  senators and lawyers of his country.\"   142 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.  fermentation, with reference to its deleterious influence on animal  life and its property of extinguishing the flame of candles.  His experiments having given him some remarkable results, he was  induced to extend them to inflammable air.  In aiming to determine all the circumstances in which these two  kinds of air manifest themselves, he soon remarked that in many  instances of combustion, especially during the calcination of metals,  the air in which such operations are conducted is altered in its nature,  without there being either fixed or inflammable air in the product.  Hence his discovery of a third species of deleterious air, which he  named pJilogistic air, and which has been since called azotic (or nitro-  gen) gas.  He had availed himself of small animals to test the pernicious  action of these different products, and was thus obliged to give pain  to sentient beings. His character is displayed in the joy which he  felt when the discovery of a fourth species of gas enabled him to  dispense with this cruel expedient. This was nitrous air, which has  the property of suddenly diminishing the volume of an}'' other with  which it mixes, very nearly, in the proportion in which that other  air is respirable, and which consequently affords the means of mea-  suring to a certain point the degree of salubrity possessed by different  kinds of air.  This discovery, which was the origin of that branch of physics  known as eudiometry, was of great importance ; all the natural  sciences were interested in possessing such a measure, and medicine,  above all, might have turned it to account but for the difficulty of  introducing scientific processes into the practice of even the most  scientific arts.  Combustion, fermentation, respiration, and putrefaction are found to  produce sometimes fixed air, sometimes inflammable, and sometimes  phlogistic air. There is thus no end to the causes which may vitiate  the atmosphere, and yet its purity has undergone no sensible altera-  tion during all the time those causes have been acting. Hence it  follows that in nature there must exist some constant means of restoring  that purity.  Priestley detected these means in discovering that vegetables possess  the property of decomposing fixed air during the day, and that they  thus puril'y the atmosphere. This property, besides being the first  key to the whole vegetable economy, when taken in connexion with  that exerted by animals of vitiating the air by respiration, disclosed  then, what has since been better developed, that the restorative ener-  gies of life consist chiefly in a perpetual transformation of elastic  fluids.  Thus these discoveries respecting air opened an altogether new  field to the researches upon living bodies, and shed a light on physi-  ology and medicine till then unknown. But still more unexpected  and brighter rays were soon to issue from the same focus.  Having applied the heat of a burning-glass to the calx of mercury,  Priestley had the good fortune to obtain, in a pure and isolated state,  that respirable constituent of atmospheric air which animals consume   MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 143  vegetables restore, and combustion alters. He named it depMogisti-  cated air.  The other aeriform fluids which differed from the atmospheric air  had been found to extinguish lights: this caused them to burn with  a brighter flame and with wonderful rapidity. The others deprived  animals of life: in this they lived longer than in even the common  air, without need of renewing it, while their faculties seemed to acquire  from it a greater energy. For the instant it was imagined a new  means of existing, and perhaps of prolonging life, had been discov-  ered, or at least an assured remedy against the greater part of the  maladies of respiration.  This hope has proved deceptive, but dephlogisticated air has not the  less remained one of the most brilliant discoveries of the eighteenth  century; it is this v^hich, under the name of oxygen, modern chemistry  regards as one of the most universal agents of nature. By its means  all combustion and calcination are effected ; it enters into the compo-  sition of all acids ; it is one of the elements of water, and the great  reservoir of fire ; to it we owe almost all the artificial heat which we  procure in common life and in the arts ; this it is which, in respira-  tion, gives to all animated bodies their natural warmth and furnishes  the material principle of their movements. The energy of different  kinds of animals is in proportion to the force of its action upon them,  and in the growth of vegetables there is no period when they do not  combine with or disengage it in different manners. In a word,  physics, chemistry, and physiology, both animal and vegetable, have  scarcely a phenomenon which they can entirely explain without the  element in question.  What has been said is but a slight sketch of the most remarkable  discoveries of Priestley ; time forces us to neglect a multitude of others  which would of themselves furnish ample materials for the eulogy of  another man. Each of his experiments has proved fertile in conse-  quences, and it can scarcely be doubted that there are some of them  which only await a closer attention to become the germ of new and  important deductions.  His labors, as might be expected, were received with general interest ;  his works translated into all languages, and his experiments repeated,  varied, and commented upon by the ablest inquirers. For his earlier  researches on phlogistic air the Royal Society had awarded him Cop-  ley's medal, which is bestowed for the most important physical labor  made public within the year, and which England regards as the  noblest prize of scientific merit. The Academy of Paris accorded him  a prize not less noble, and, because rarer, of more difficult attainment,  the place of one of its eight foreign associates ; an object of compe-  tition to all the scientists of Europe, and whose list of names, com-  mencing with those of Newton, Leibnitz and Peter the Great, has  never degenerated from that original splendor.  Priestley saw with surprise this accumulation of honors and mod-  estly wondered at the multitude of precious truths which nature  seemed to have reserved for his sole discovery. He forgot that her  favors are never gratuitous, and that it' she had so freely disclosed her-  self, it was because he had known how to extort her answers by the   144 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY  indefatigable perseverance of his inquiries and the number and variety  of his expedients. While others sedulously conceal how much they  owe to hazard, Priestley seemed inclined to credit it with everything.  He tells us, with unexampled candor, how often he was indebted to it  unconsciously, how often new substances presented themselves to him  without being recognized ; nor does he ever dissemble the erroneous  views which sometimes governed him and from which he was only  detached by further experience.  These avowals did honor to his modesty without disarming jealousy.  Those, whose own views and methods had proved abortive in discovery,  called him a mere experimenter without method or design ; no wonder,  they observed, if, among so many trials and combinations, some should  be lucky.  But the true physicist is not to be duped by such interested criti-  cisms. He is well aware how many efforts it costs to arrive at those  happy ideas which are the source and regulating principle of all others ;  while the very men who have thought fit to augment our admiration  of their own great achievements in science by the luminous order in  which they propound them, will be far from taking it amiss, that  others, like Priestley, have chosen to give us their discoveries just as  they made them, and have ingenuously retraced all the windings of  the path over which they have travelled.  This peculiarity results from his manner of composition. We have  here no finished construction, no digest of theorems rigidly deduced  the one from the other, as they may be supposed to present them-  selves in the conceptions of pure reason. What he has given us is  the journal of his thoughts in all the disorder of their succession,  wherein we see him at first feeling his way in profound obscurity,  spying out the faintest rays of light that he may collect and reflect  them, sometimes misled by a treacherous and transient glimmer, but  sure to arrive in the end at some region of vast extent and fertility.  Should we be displeased if the great masters of the human race,  an Archimedes or a Newton, for instance, had thus admitted us to the  confidence of their genius? Newton, when asked how he arrived at  his great discoveries, replied, \" By long thinking about them.\" With  what pleasure should we not have learned that long series of thoughts  by which Newton was conducted to that master thought which has  inspired the meditations of all his successors. If his works at present  teach us to appreciate the forces of nature, we should, by thus knowing  the actual processes of his mind, have been enabled thoroughly to  comprehend that noblest of nature's works â€” the genius of a great  man.  We must not suppose, however, that the discoveries of Priestley were  all perceived by himself, or that they were set forth in his writings as  clearly or in the same manner as we should now state them. At  the time of making them he knew no chemical theory but that of  Stahl, and this, being founded on experiments in which air was taken  no account of, was of course incapable of providing for its phenomena.  Hence there results a degree of hesitation as to principles, and of em-  barrassment and uncertainty as to results. Seeking everywhere for  phlogiston, Priestley is obliged to suppose it differently constituted   MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 145  He finds it now in fixed air, wliicli is heavy and acid ; now in inflam-  mable air, whicli is light ; and again in phlogisticated air, which has  no property of the other two. Sometimes there are cases where an  accumulation of phlogiston diminishes the weight of the combination  and communicates an absolute levity to the mixture ; in other cases  it produces a directly contrary effect. Thus there is no uniformity,  nor is it possible to arrive at any general and precise conclusion.  That conclusion it was left for modern chemistry to draw, and for  this purpose it has needed but one or two formulas. There is no such  thing as phlogiston; pure air (or oxygen) is a simple substance, as are  also phlogisticated air and injiammable air; combustion is only the com-  bination of pure air loitli combustible substances. These few words  have served to disembroil the chaos; every fact has fallen into its  proper place, and chemistry has emerged in the fair and consistent  form in which we possess it.  But chemistry, like the gods of the pagans, could create nothing  out of nothing ; elementary material v/as still needed for its dispo-  sal, and this material, Priestley, beyond all others, has furnished.  Under this point of view, therefore, lie may justly be considered one  of the fathers of modern chemistry and be worthily associated with  the authors of that celebrated revolution in science. He was a father,  however, who never consented to recognize his offspring.  His perseverance in combatting on behalf of his original ideas has  probably no parallel. Without being shaken in his convictions he  saw the most skilful defenders of those ideas pass into the opposite  camp ; and when Kirwan, the last nearly of all of them, abjured the  phlogistic doctrine, Priestley, unsupported and alone, still occupied  the field and addressed a new defiance to his opponents, the principal  Frencli chemists of his time.  This challenge was at once taken up and replied to by Adet, who  was then ambassador of France to the United States, and thus proved  himself a worthy representative of French chemistry. The new argu-  ments of Priestley against that theory originated, in fact, from his own  want of familiarity with the operations of more recent chemistry,  liowever ingenious and dexterous he might be in those processes which  he had himself created. When he drew fixed air from substances  into which he did not suspect it of having entered, he would deny  that it invariably owes its origin to the carbon. And in forming water  from oxygen and hydrogen, though a 8m[i,ll quantity of nitric acid  was always present, he would take no account of the portion of azote  which produced it.  His later writings failed, accordingly, to bring back to his opinion  any of those who had abandoned it. Like so many others who have  endeavored to arrest movements first communicated by themselves, he  experienced that ideas once dispersed abroad are as the seed whose  product depends upon the laws of nature^ and not the will of those  who have scattered them. To which we may add that, when they  have once taken root, no human power is any longer capable of eradi-  cating them.  It remains now to trace, with painful interest, the career of Priest-  ley in that other branch of his labors to which reference has already  10   146 â€¢ MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.  \"been made. We have just seen liim marching from one success to  another in the cultivation of the merely human sciences, which he  looked upon only as the employment of his leisure moments. We  must now observe him engaged in the struggle to unveil those first  principles which the nature of things hides from our reason beneath  the folds of impenetrable mystery, striving to force the world into an  acceptance of his conjectures, consuming almost his whole life in these  fruitless efforts, and sinking at last into an abyss of misfortune.  Every indulgence will be here needed as well for the recital as its  subject. It may even appear to some that such details are out of  place before this audience ; but where else ought the admonition they  afford to be listened to with more interest ?  It has been already said that Priestley was an ecclesiastic ; it must  now be added that he passed successively through three creeds or  formsof belief in arriving at one which he could conscientiously adopt  as the basis of his teachings.  Reared in all the severity of the Presbyterian communion, which is  called Calvinistic in France, he passed at the age of twenty years into  the ranks of Arianism. * * * * Arianism, while holding  Christ to be a creature, regards him as a Being of superior nature, pro-  duced before the world, and himself the organ of the Creator in the  production of other beings. It is the doctrine which the \" Paradise  Lost\" has invested with so magnificent a garb of poetry. Priestley  professed it for a length of time, and then abandoned it to become  what we should call in France, a Socinian. Few, perhaps, of those  who hear me know in what these two sects differ; but the Socin-  ians deny the pre-existence of Christ, and regard him only as a  man, though they revere in him the Saviour of the world. This subtle  distinction between two creeds occupied for thirty years a head  which the most important questions of science might rightfully have  claimed, and was to Priestley the occasion of incomparably more  pages than he has written on the different kinds of air. * * *  * * * Nor was he less peculiar in the metaphysical part of  his creed. It seems to have been demonstrated by the sounder meta-  physics of modern times that it is impossible for the thinking sub-  stance to take direct cognizance of its own proper nature, just as it is  impossible for the eye to see itself. For any such purpose, to contem-  plate itself or compare itself with other existences, it should be able to  do so from without, while it is only within and through its own pecu-  liar modifications that it perceives, or receives the impression of those  existences. Priestley either overlooked or disregarded these conclu-  sions. In his view. Scripture and experience agree in making the soul  material ; the fibres of the brain are the depositary of the images  produced by the senses, while the power which these fibres possess of  communicating their vibrations to one another is the source of the  association of ideas. Sensation perishes with the body, but will revive  with it at tlie day of resurrection, in virtue of the will and power of  God. Till then we shall sleep in absolute insensibility ; the distiibu-  tion of punishments and rewards awaits us only thereafter.*  *It should be remarked that the above is far from being an accurate representation of the,  materialism of Priestley, nhich should not be confounded with the grosser forms of thatdoc-   MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 147  A material soul must necessarily be submissive to exterior impulses,  and thus absolute necessity, not free will, becomes the law of our deter-  minations. If rewards and punishments are attached to our conduct  it is only to give one more determining cause in favor of virtue.  These doctrins are, many of them, those of the earlier Socinians, to  which Priestley only brought the support of new arguments. Without  stopping to discuss questions so foreign to the ordinary studies of the  Academy, and which it is enough to have briefly recalled, it is proper  to say that he sustained his opinions with but too much skill. Even  his adversaries give him credit for great erudition and singular dex-  terity in combining and disposing of his resources, and look upon him,  therefore, as one of the strongest controversialists and enemies of  orthodoxy in these latter times. =i; * * ^ * *  It might be thought that in rejecting so many opinions Priestley had  but one more step to take to fall into the most absolute incredulity.  But this he never did ; on the contrary, it seemed to please him to  occupy, in theology as in physics, a post by himself, which, however  perilous, he distrusted not his own courage or ability to defend.  Those who went farther than himself or not so far, the orthodox and  the skeptical, were alike the objects of his attack, and wherever, in  all Europe, anything appeared which seemed to menace, in the least  degree, either revelation in general or his own manner of interpreting  it, that he felt himself called upon to refute. His activity in this  species of warfare was without bouuds ; atheists, deists, Jews, arians,  quakers, methodists, calvinists, church of England men, and catho-  lics, were all taught to recognize him as an opponent. There are  publications of his against each of these forms of belief, the very  titles of which it would be almost endless to recite.  A proof that all this was done in good faith is the fact that he  thought himself authorized to predict from Scripture events that were  near at hand. Prophets who have not his confidence take care to  jDostpone the accomplishment of their predictions, so as not to have  them falsified during tlieir own lifetime. But Priestley felt more  secure of his facts ; he published, in 1799, an address to the Jews, in  which he announced to them, from the revelations of Daniel and St.  John, their speedy re-establishment in Palestine, with a reunion of  all creeds and the foundation of a reign of glory. Besides the calcu-  lation according to years, which referred this great event to the com-  mencement of the nineteentli century, it was to be heralded by such  tokens as the destruction of the pa})al power, of the Turkish empire,  and of the kingdoms of Europe. The French monarchy, firm as it  seemed, had already fallen ; the rest would soon follow; the Pope  was dethroned and in exile ; the Turk only subsisted through the  compassion of his neighbors. Priestley lived long enough to see the  failure of at least a part of these supposed tokens.  Details like these, however extraordinary, could not be passed in  trine. He had adopted the theory of Boscovich, as presented in the Theoria Philosophies  Jfaturalis, &c., 1758, according to which, matter consists in emanations of force from detinito  portions of space, and is in reality devoid of any other substratum. â€” Tr.   148 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.  silence, for the eloges of the Academy are historic, and, as was ex-  pressly prescribed by the first and most illustrious of our predeces-  sors, are bound on every occasion to a fair exposition of the pro and  con. Nor can it be otherwise than useful to observe, as in the present  example, to what lengths the finest genius may be misled when it  attempts to overleap the limits which Providence has prescribed to  our understanding. There is even more instruction in the errors of  such a man as Priestley than in his actual misfortunes ; for where is  the generous mind that would not suffer even greater misfortunes  than his if it were only sure of having announced truth and vindi-  cated right?  Yet it was not precisely the theology of Priestley which occasioned  his misfortunes ; in England every one dogmatises as he pleases. It  was his politics, too closely allied to that theology ; the politics of  dissenters being in almost every case the politics of opposition.  We have been accustomed, in France, to consider protestants ns  republicans from religion ; they are only so from oppression. In  Ireland it is the catholics who pass for republicans, while the protest-  ants, who rule, are royalists, because the king is of their party.  This natural opposition is more vehement in England than else-  where, precisely because there dissenters are tolerated by halves, and  only by halves. Excluded from honors and employment, they are  constrained to the rigid payment of tithes for a ibrm of worship  which is not their own. Their children are not even admitted into  the national universities, and yet, influential both from their numbers  and wealth, they are left at full liberty to assemble, to debate, to  print â€” to exercise, in fact, every means of inflaming their resentments.  For thirty years Priestley was the most eloquent, bold, and perse-  vering organ of their grievances. He put forth twenty volumes in  this service. In this service solely did he write against the celebrated  treatise in which Burke predicted in so true and startling a manner  the evils which must flow from the French revolution. Apparently  the object of Priestley's reply was not well understood in France, for  he owed to this his nomination as French citizen and member of the  convention, two titles which, at that time, seemed to sit but ill on so  warm a defender of revelation and universal toleration. The first he  did not decline, but the exercise of the second was evaded on the plea  that he did not sufficiently understand the French language.  Without pronouncing as to the substance, it must be conceded that  the political writings of Priestley unite a rare moderation in terms to  a consistency of principle not less rare. He asks nothing for dissenters  which he does not equally ask for catholics, and with more urgency  for the latter as the greater sufferers. No catholic has more vividly  painted the oppression under which nine- tenths of the Irish people  labor.  I know not what gratitude the catholics may have evinced for  these efforts of a unitarian in their behalf, but this extension of his  good will had no tendency, we may well conceive, to reconcile him  with the Anglican party. To the high churchmen he had become by  these means the object of a concentrated hostility ; those who wrote   I   MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 149  against liira were held in peculiar favor, and in some cases were, on  this very account, rewarded with prelacies ; which led Priestley pleas-  antly to observe \" that he might he considered as holding the portfolio  of such benefices in his own hands.\" But the aversion he inspired  did not stop within these venial limits ; there is too much reason to  think that the popular turbulence of which he was the victim was  greatly fomented by the intemperate writings and discourses of min-  isters of the establishment.  The first movements of the Frencli revolution had at that time  wrought division, not only in France, but in all the States, cities, and  even families of Europe. As yet there was no outbreak but in France,  but men disputed everywhere, and, strange to say, it was precisely in  the freest countries that the greatest ardor for revolution manifested  itself. Under these circumstances the partisans of the British gov-  ernment had recourse to means of which the enemies of government  in France were setting a successful example, and prompted the popular  riots by which the revolutionists, or those suspected of being such,  were assailed.  Not the least formidable of these riots was that wliich occurred at  Birmingham, July 14, 1791. A banquet was given on that day by  persons of different sects, including some episcopalians, to celebrate  the anniversary of the attack upon the Bastile, and it was reported  that Priestley was the chief promoter of the festival. As his enemies  had spared no means of inflaming the popular mind, resorting even  to the fabrication of tickets of invitation replete with sedition, and  â– of toasts steeped in criminality or absurdity_, a heated crowd is soon  collected ; the calumny circulates and is aggravated by the most  odious imputations ; and the tavern finally, where the guests are assem-  bled, is assaulted and sacked. The furious multitude exclaim aloud  against Priestley ; he is the organ of dissent, the file leader of revo-  lution, the man against whom has long been levelled the hatred of  every true friend of his country. The moment has arrived when they  can avenge themselves.  The unfortunate philosopher, so far from participating in the dinner,  was ignorant of what was imputed to him and of all that was passing  in the city. But an excited rabble listens to nothing ; they conclude  that he lias taken flight, and proceed with torches and other instru-  ments of destruction to his mansion.  This was a modest retreat, half a mile in the country, where he  lived with his wife and two sons in the simplicity of ancient manners.  Here it was that he had received the homage of men illustrious by  birth or merit, none of whom would have been content to leave Eng-  land without seeing him ; and here for eleven years he had divided  his time between the pursuit of science, the instruction of youth, and  the exercise of that charity whicli he considered the first duty of his  ministry.  Here there was only one ornament to be seen, only an incomparable  one ; the rich collection of instruments, in great part devised and con-  structed by himself; the focus from which had radiated so many new  truths, and which had dift'used inestimable benefits among those who  .now rushed to its destruction ; for these were almost all artisans of   150 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.  Birmingham, and among the numerous manufactures of that city,  there is scarcely one which does not owe some improvement in its pro-  cesses to the discoveries of Priestley.  But what avails gratitude against the spirit of party, or does the  people know ought of services of this kind ? All was laid in ashes ;  apparatus, in which experiments designed for the solution of import-  ant questions had been for months in process of development, records  of the observations of many years, works in course of preparation, a  large library, enriched with notes, additions and commentaries, were,  in a few moments, with the house itself, utterly destroyed.  It was truly afflictive that such a man should thus see the fruits of  forty years of honorable assiduity and wise economy suddenly snatched  away â€” a loss not merely of his moderate fortune, which he might  have disregarded, but of the works of his hand, the conceptions of his  genius, the fund which he had reserved for the meditations and em-  ployment of his remaining life. Fortunately his family had been  apprised of the approach of the mob, and had withdrawn him in time  from the dreadful spectacle.  The riot continued three days^ and the houses of his friends under-  went the same fate with his own. As usual, it M^as the victims who  were accused, and the public journals failed not to announce that there  had been discovered among the papers of Priestley the proofs of a  wide-spread conspiracy.  This calumny is sufficiently refuted by the fact that he openly resided  two years more near London, in the college of the dissenters at  Hackney, where he succeeded the celebrated Dr. Price in the professor-  ship of chemistry. There was time enough to bring him to justice,  and no want of zeal on the part of his accusers, if there had existed  the slightest proof.  They confined themselves to painting him in the most odious colors  in political pamphlets and periodicals. Few instances can be found  of such overflowing rancor, nor would it be easy to credit this rage  of defamation against a man who conferred so much honor on his  country, had we not before our eyes the examples which the last fifteen  years have furnished of the power of party spirit to envenom men's  opinions, and those which the last fifteen centuries exhibit of the fury  with which personal crimination may be urged when the pretext is  religion.  Nothing in the character of Priestley seemed calculated to produce  such hostility ; his sentiments were never influenced by his contro-  versies, as might be shown by his friendly intimacy with Dr. Price,  though they had often written against each other. So far from any  turbulence or haughtiness of manner, his conversation was always  noted for the same modesty which pervades his writings, and nothing  was easier with him than to say, I do not knoio â€” words which the  generality of professedly learned men find it so difficult to pronounce.  His countenance bore rather the impression of melancholy than of  animation, though he was by no means indifterent to the company of  his friends, and enlivened their intercourse with a natural and becom-  ing gaiety. This man, so profound in many parts of science, passed  several hours of each day in teaching the young. This was with him   MEMOIR OF PEIESTLEY. 151  a favorite occupatiou, and his pupils still revere his memory with  filial tenderness, many of them with genuine enthusiasm.  But no consideration could induce him to pause when he thought  there was some truth to be defended, and this trait of character, so  admirable in itself, destroyed the effect of more amiable qualities and  constituted the torment of his life; because he carried it to exaggera-  tion, and because he forgot that reasoning is the least of the means  which must be used to make men adopt opinions which conflict with  their habits of thought or temporary interests.  The insults heaped upon him, and the fear of again compromising  the lives and fortunes of his friends, at last made a sojourn in his own  country intolerable. In his new engagements at Hackney, industry  and patience might repair, as they had already in part repaired, the  disasters of Birmingham ; but this consideration was not sufficient to  detain him ; and as coming to France during the war would have  given countenance to the charges of his enemies, he could see no  chance of repose except in the United States of America. Yet was it  some time before he found it even there ; English j^rejudices followed  him beyond the seas, and not until the accession of Jefferson to the  Presidency was he free from the apprehension of being obliged to quit  that asylum.  The dedication of his Ecclesiastical History to that great magistrate,  in acknowledgment of the tranquillity restored to him, and the reply  of Jefferson, afford a noble specimen of the relations which may sub-  sist between men of letters and men in place without humiliation to  either.  Priestley proposed to consecrate the rest of his life to the work just  mentioned, in which he intended to comprise the development and  proofs of all his theological opinions ; but he was arrested at the fourth  volume by a fatal accident. His food^ by some unknown means,  proved one day to have been poisoned ;* his whole family was placed  in jeopardy, and his own health languished from that time forward.  A gradual decay terminated liis life after three years of suffering. He  died at Northumberland, in Pennsylvania, February G, 1804.  His last moments were marked by the effusions of the same piety  which had animated him through life, and which, from not being well  regulated, liad occasioned all its errors. He caused the Gospels to be  read to him, and thanked God for having granted him a useful life  and peaceful death. Among his chief blessings he ranked that of  having personally known all his celebrated cotemporaries. \"I am  going to sleep like you,\" he said to his grandchildren, who were  brought to his bedside; \"but we shall all awake together,\" he added,  looking towards the attendants, \"and I trust to everlasting happi-  ness.\" These were his latest words, and they bear witness to the  belief in which he died.  Such was the end of a man whom his enemies accused of wishing to  subvert all religion and morals ; but whose chief fault was to have  misconceived his vocation, and to have attached too much importance  Â« The statement made here, as well as in some other works, of the poisoning whicli  occasioned the decline and death of Dr. Priestley rests on little or no authority. â€” Translator.   152 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.  to liis private sentiments in matters where the most important of all  sentiments must be the love of peace.  [Note. â€” We are informed by Lord Brougham that, on settling at  Warrington, \" Priestley married the daughter of Mr. Wilkinson, a  respectable iron master in Wales. She was an amiable woman and  endowed with great strength of mind, which was destined afterwards  to be severely tried.\" By her he had three sons and one daughter,  of whom the youngest son, Henry, the peculiar companion of his  father's agricultural labors at his new home, in Pennsylvania, died at  the age of eighteen, in 1795. The mother died ten months later,  '' These blows,\" says Lord B., \" though he felt their weight, did not  at all crush him ; his resignation was exemplary, and his steady,  enthusiastic faith in revelation gave him a certain hope of meeting,  before many years should elapse, with those whom he had lost. It  was, indeed, quite evident that religion was as much an active princi-  ple in him as in any one who ever lived. Not only is it always upper-  most in his thoughts, but he even regards temporal concerns of a  public nature always in connexion with the Divine superintendence,  and even with the prophecies of Scripture. His letters are full of  references to those prophecies as bearing on passing events, and he  plainly says that, since his removal to America, he should care little  for European events but for their connexion with the Old Testament.  He also looked for an actual and material second coming of Christ  upon earth.\"  The descendants of Dr. Priestley appear, from an account received  through the courtesy of a grandson, Joseph R. Priestley, to be widely  dispersed. Not only do several of them remain in his native country,  at London and Birmingham, but others are to be found at Northum-  berland, Pennsylvania, where he settled in this country ; at New  Orleans ; at Atlanta, in Georgia ; and even at Melbourne, in Austra-  lia. He was buried at Northumberland, and the following is the  inscription on his tomb :  To  The memory of the Reverend  Dr. Joseph Priestley,  Who departed this life on the 6 Feb., 1804,  Anno a3tatis LXXI.

INSIT.UCTIONS IX KEFERENCE TO COI.LECTING NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH  AMERICAN BIRDS.   INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.  The Smithsonian Institution is desirous of collecting as full a series  as possible of the nests and eggs of birds of North America, with the  view not merely of exhibition in its museum, but to furnish ma-  terials for a work on North American Oology, in preparation by  Dr. Brewer, of Boston, and to be published in successive parts by  the Institution.  This memoir is intended to give an account of the geographical  distribution of North American birds, as well as of their habits and  peculiarities during the breeding season, and to be accompanied as far  as possible by accurate figures of the principal varieties of the egg of  each species, based upon photographic drawings. Of this work, the  first part, embracing the Bapfores (vultures, hawks, and owls,) and  Fissirostres, (swallows, swifts, and goatsuckers,) is nearly ready for  publication, and will be issued during the year 1859.  The object contemplated by the institution is not merely to procure  specimens of eggs not previously in its possession, but also to obtain  positive evidence as to the limits within which each species rears its  young. For this reason it respectfully invites donations from all parts  of the country of as many kinds of nests and eggs as can be procured,  with the exception of a few of the very commonest species hereafter  to be mentioned ; and requests that special effort be made to procure  a full series for each locality. As duplicate eggs of all kinds, and  in any number, can be readily used in the exchanges of the Institu-  tion, and in supplying other cabinets, no fear need be entertained of  sending more than enough lor the purposes in view.  The eggs, of which a single set only need be collected for the present,  are chiefly those of the eastern blue bird, (Sialia sialis,) the robin,  (Turdus migraiorius,) the cat-bird, (31imics carolinensis,) the red-winged  black bird, {Agelaius phoeniceus,) and the crow black bird, (Qmscalus  versicolor.) Those to which particular attention should be paid as  groups, are the hawks, owls, wood{)eckers, small waders, ducks, &c.,  of all portions of the country ; but, as stated, all kinds of eggs, and  particularly those from the regions west of the Mississippi, and Irom the  northern parts of America, are desired. A subjoined list embraces the  specimens more particularly wanting to the collection of the Institution ;  those having an asterisk prefixed being, with rare exceptions, entirely  unknown to science. The numbers in the list refer to a printed cata-  logue of North American birds, published by the Institution, which  will be sent to any one who proposes to collect eggs for its museum.   154 NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS.  In this catalogue about 720 species are enumerated as now known,  while of these the eggs of more than five hundred are marked as  desiderata, more than three hundred, or nearly one-half, being  unknown in American collections. Among easily identified species  most wanted are the California vulture (Cathartes californianus ;)  the swallow-tailed hawk, {Nauclerus furcatus,) and the black-should-  ered hawk, (Elanus Uucurus) of the south ; the burrowing owl of the  plains, {Athene hypicgaea,) the ivory-billed woodpecker, (Picus princi-  jyalis,) the western hairy woodpecker, {Picus harrisii,) the red cock-  aded woodpecker of the south, {Picus horealis,) the red-bellied  woodpecker, {Genturus carolinus,) the red-shafted woodpecker or  flicker of the west, {Colaptes mcxicamts,) the Oregon robin or varied  thrush, {Turdus naevius,) the California blue bird, {Sialia 7nexicana,)  the Kocky mountain blue bird, {S. arctica,) the western nuthatch,  {Sitta,) the fish-crow of Puget Sound_, {Corvus caurinus,) all the jays  of the Kocky mountain region ; the Canada jay, {Perisoreus cana-  densis,) the band-tailed pigeon, {Golumha fasciata,) the wild turkey  of New Mexico, [Meleagris mexicana,) all the quails or partridges of  western Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona ; the whooping or white  prairie crane, {Grus americana,) the glossy ibis, {Ibis ordii ;) most of  the snipes, sandpipers, curlews^ and other small waders ; the two  species of swans, {Gygnus,) most of the geese and ducks ; the booby  gannet of Florida, {Sula fiber,) the wild pigeon, and many other  species.  The following details will be found to contain all the instructions  necessary to the preparation and preservation of oological collections :  INSTRUCTIONS FOK COLLECTING AND PRESERVING.  The nests of birds are to be sought for in all localities and in diflfjprent  months of the year, according to the latitude. May and June being  generally the most productive. Many of the rapacious birds, how-  ever, begin to lay much earlier in the middle States, even in February  and March.  When a nest containing eggs, or one newly constructed, is dis-  covered, it should not be disturbed, if possible, before the parents have  been observed hovering around or near, and thus identified. If the  species cannot be otherwise positively determined, a parent bird should  be secured, and either the whole skin be prepared, or a portion â€” as  the head or wing, and preserved for identification. The whole bird  may be thrown into alcohol, and thus easily kept.  The services of boys and other persons on farms, plantations, &c.,  may be called to great advantage into requisition in collecting eggs.  Whenever they have found a nest, however, it should not be disturbed  before information is communicated to and the spot visited by some  one competent to determine the species, unless the parents can be taken  with the nest. No pains should be considered too great to secure the  certain identification of each set of eggs. If, however, this identifi-  cation should be impossible, the eggs should still be preserved, as the  species can usually be approximated to, if not absolutely determined,  by an expert oologist.   NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 155  Sometimes by removing all the eggs in a nest, except one or two,  without handling those left_, quite a large number can be obtained  from one pair of birds ; generally, howeverj the nest will be found  abandoned on a second visit.  The nests may not always be removable, and in such cases, full men-  tion of their position, character, &c., should be carefully made. Nests  constructed in bushes or on trees usually need but slight precautions  for their preservation intact. Those on the ground often require to  be secured against falling to pieces by a little judicious tying  together, or even by a few coarse stitches with a thread and needle.  A little cotton packed in the nest above the eggs will generally keep  the latter whole until reaching home, unless subjected to a violent  shock. It will be safer, however, to enclose each one in an envelope  of cotton.  It is absolutely necessary, in all cases, to empty every egg of its  contents, in order to preserve the shell for cabinet purposes ; and this  should be done at the earliest moment possible. It is accomplished in  various ways : the simplest, when the egg does not contain a young  bird, being to prick a small aperture at each end (or better, perhaps,  on opposite sides) Tvith a sharp needle, (a three-cornered one answers  best,) one rather the larger, through which the contents are blown  by the application of the mouth at the other. Delicate eggs, how-  ever, when fresh, can be best emptied by suction, a small quantity at  a time of the contents being drawn into the mouth, and then dis-  charged.  Should there be an embryo in the egg, or should the contents have  become thickened by long standing, it will be necessary to make a  larger aperture in the side by ^iricking out a circular piece of shell  carefully with the needle. A smaller hole may then be made opposite  to this, at which to apply the mouth in blowing, or the embryo may  be picked out through a single large hole. It will be of much interest  to preserve all embryos in alcohol for further investigation.  European collectors usually make two small apertures close to each  other on one side, instead of on opposite sides. The discharge of the  contents of the egg is facilitated by the use of a small conical blow-pipe  or tube, the smaller end so fine as to enter the smaller aperture. A  stream of water injected by the mouth through the tube into the  aperture will be found an expeditious method of emptying the egg,  but it must be conducted very carefully. When a large hole is made,  the tube may be directed through it to the opposite side of the egg,  and a current of water forced in this will soon discharge the contents.  When practicable, the white membrane, the edge of which usually  protrudes from the opening after the liquids are forced out, should be  seized with a pair of forceps and pulled out, as, if left, it may discolor  the egg, and will always attract insects. If not too small, the egg  should then be partly filled with water through the tube, or by laying  one hole against a saucer of water and sucking through the other,  and carefully rinsed out. After the water is again blown out, the  egg may be allowed to dry by placing the larger hole downwards on  blotting or absorbent paper or cloth. When dry, the eggs should be  re2)laced in the nest, or laid carefully away, care being taken to add   156 NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH AMERICA.N BIRDS.  a number or other mark showing the locality, date, collector, and  supposed species, as well as relationship to an embryo removed, or to  any portion of the parent preserved. It will in most cases be best  to attach the same number to nest, eggs, embryo, and parent  belonging together. This mark may be made neatly on the eggs,  itself with ink and a quill pen, or on a label carefully packed with  them. A record book showing what has been taken and preserved,  with dates and explanatory remarks, should always be kept.  In making the apertures in eggs that have peculiar markings, care  should be taken to select some inconspicuous spot that will leave the  pattern of coloration undisturbed. Eggs that are cracked may be  greatly strengthened by pasting tissue or other thin paper along the  line of injury, or what is easier, and in most cases even better, by brush-  ing collodion along and over the cracks. It is often well to cover the  punctures or holes cut out, especially if large, with thin paper or gold-  beaters' skin. If a piece be removed, it can usually be easily replaced  and kept in by pasting thin paper over it and the line of separation,  or around the latter.  Notwithstanding the apparent fragility of eggs, a very little expe-  rience will enable any one to empty them of their contents with great  ease and safety. The principal accident to be guarded against is that  of crushing the egg by too great pressure between the fingers ; these  should be applied so as to barely hold the egg, and no more. If the  operation of emptying be performed over a full basin of water, the  occasional dropping of the egg from the finger into the water will be  attended with no harm.  To pack eggs for transportation, each one should be wrapped in a  light envelope of cotton and laid down in layers separated by strata  of cotton. They should be kept in rather small boxes of wood, or if  pasteboard be used, these should always be transmitted in wooden  boxes, as the eggs are thereby less likely to be broken by a sudden jar  or shock. If the nest is sent along, it may contain the eggs belong-  ing to it, each one wrapped in cotton, and the vacancy of the nest filled  with the same or other light elastic material. It will be well to pin  or tie up each nest in paper to keep it secure, and to prevent entangling  of the materials when several are laid together. A temporary box  may often be readily constructed of pasteboard, to contain the more  delicate or valuable ones.  Whenever practicable, the embryos or young found in the egg  should be carefully preserved in alcohol, great care being of course  taken to mark the specimens properly. The better plan will be to  keep each set in a small bottle or vial, and a slip of stiff paper or  parchment placed inside with the number or name. Whenever the  abundance of the eggs will warrant it, a large number with the  young in different degrees of development, even as many as fifty of a  kind, should be secured. The embryos in this case need not be re-  moved from the egg, which should, however, be cracked at the blunt  end to facilitate the entrance of the spirit. Researches at present in  progress relating to the embryology of birds promise results of the  highest interest in reference to ornithological classification.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.   INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.   The Smithsonian Institution has undertaken the preparation of a  series of reports en the insects of North America, with the view of  attracting attention to and facilitating the study of a department of  natural history^ which, though so much neglected, is yet of great  practical importance to the agriculturist and rural economist. These  works will consist â€” first, of catalogues of all the known genera and  species of each order, with reference to the places of publication ; and  secondly, of monographs and detailed descriptions of both old and new  species, so as to enable any one interested in the subject to identify the  insects met with, and to prosecute investigations respecting them.  Towards the accomplishment of this object the Institution has  already published a catalogue of the North American Coleoptera, by  Dr.F.E. Melsheimer, andalso oneof theDiptera, by Baron Ostensacken,  while similar catalogues of Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera,  and Diurnal Lepidoptera are in an advanced state of preparation. It  is now proposed to take up a very interesting and extensive group,  that of the Moths or Night Butterflies, and contributions of materials  towards a work on this subject are, therefore, respectfully solicited.  There is no locality in the country where new species may not be  readily obtained, and from which complete collections are not desira-  ble^ although novelties are most to be looked for from the regions of  the west. From every region the most common and familiar species are  equally desirable, with the rarest and most striking ; the object being  not merely to collect all the species, but also to determine accurately  their geographical distribution.  In the following pages will be found special instructions for collect-  ing insects, furnished for this article by different entomologists, with  some general remarks on the subject taken from Samouelle's Entomo\"  legist's Companion.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 159   GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.   \" Insects are so various in their habits that they may be found in  every part of the world^ at all seasons of the jear, and in every situa-  tion.  As some localities are more congenial to their nature than others, I  shall mention such as will be likely to furnish the best result to the  Entomologist :  Woods, Hedges, and Lanes. â€” These situations furnish by far the  greatest number of insects. In woods the Entomologist must beat the  branches of trees into his umbrella, or folding net, and must select  for this purpose open paths, the edges, &c. The trunks of trees,  gates, and felled timber, should be carefully examined, as many of  the Lepidoptera and Coleoptera are found in no other situations.  Many rare and very beautiful insects are found in the hedges, in  lanes, as also in the nettles, &c,, which grow under them ; these should  be well beaten, especially when the white thorn is in blossom, in the  months of May and June. Hedges in dusty roads are seldom pro-  ductive.  Heaths and Commons. â€” Many insects are coniined to these situa-  tions, not only on account of plants, which grow in such situations,  but by the cattle and their dung, in the latter of which many thou-  sands of insects may be found â€” mostly in the months of May, June,  and July ; these are principally Coleoptera.  Sand-Fits. â€” In such places will be found many minute Coleop-  terous insects, as well as wasps, &c.; the roots of grass, at which the  former are found, should be closely examined.  Meadoivs, Marshes, a7id Ponds. â€” In meadows when the Butter-  cups (Ranunculi) are in blossom, many Dipterous and Hymenopterous  insects are found. The drills in marshes should be examined, as many  species of insects are found on the long grass, as also the larva? of  many Lepidoptera. Neuroptera are abundant in such situations, espe-  cially if any hedges or trees are near the spot.  The mud which is brought up from the bottom of ponds should  be thoroughly examined, and such small insects as are found may be  put in a small bottle filled with water, which will not only clean them  iDut keep them alive. To the Entomologist this mode of collecting  will be very advantageous, as he will thereby obtain many species of  Dysticidie, Notonectidti?, &c.  31oss, Decayed Trees, Hoots of Grass, &c. â€” Many insects will be  found in moss and under it ; the roots of decayed trees afford nourish-  ment and a habitation to a number of insects ; many of the larva3 of  Lepidoptera penetrate the trunks of trees ; most of the Cerambycida)  feed on wood, as well as some species of Elaters, &c. In seeking for  these a sharp digging instrument is generally used, as it is sometimes  necessary to dig six or seven inches into the wood before they are found.   160 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  Banks of Ilivers and Sandy Sea-shores. â€” These situations are pro-  ductive of a great variety of Coleoptera, and other insects.  The dead animals that are thrown upon the shores should be care-  fully examined, as they are the food of Silphidte, HisteridfB, Staphy-  linidre, &c. May and June are the best times for collecting in these  localities.  Dead animals and dry bones should be constantly examined, as  these are the natural habitations of many insects.  Fungi, boleti, and flowers, should be carefully, when met with,  examined, as many exceedingly rare insects inhabit them.\"  [The preceding general remarks have been taken from Samouelle's  Entomologists' Guide.]   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING COLEOPTERA.   BY JOHN L. LE CONTE, M. D.   General Remarks.  The insects of this order are mandibulate, or furnished with jaws,  and may be distinguished by the upper wings being converted into  hard corneous shields, which protect wholly or part of the upper sur-  face of the abdomen. They are very numerous, more than 8,000  species having already been collected in the United States, while  several thousand species probably remain to be discovered, especially  in our Territories west of the Mississippi.  On account of the ease with which the specimens are obtained and  preserved, this is the favorite order of insects with collectors, and  although not equalling in beauty the Lepidoptera, the gem-like lustre  of many is not without merit, and above all the very distinct generic  and specific differences leading to more accurate classification have  induced many scientific men of high ability to devote tlieir time assidu-  ously to this order, and with the happiest results in philosophic  generalizations.  The species are to be found in almost every variety of situation,  among which may be here specified, under stones, especially where  the soil is not very dry ; under bark of dead trees in ants' nests ; in  fungi, on leaves of plants, especially on the low trees and shrubbery  on the edges of forests and streams ; in dead carcases of animals ; in  excrement. Many are seen flying and alighting again in roads  during the hotter part of the day ; some live in water, and can only  be procured by small nets, while a great number of minute species  may be taken on the wing just before sunset. Many are found only  on the shores of the ocean, under material cast up by the waves ; a  large number will be attracted by a light near an open window at  night. For the purpose of more easily securing these, the table on  which the light is placed should be covered with a white cloth. Fi-   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 161  nally, many minute species will appear on throwins^ witli tlie hand  water on the damp mud of the banks of streams and lakes.  The most suitable times for collecting Coleoptera are the spring and  autumn ; during the great heats of July and August they diminish  greatly in numbers ; the search for them should begin as soon as the  frost is out of the ground ; at such times water beetles and those  found in ants' nests, under bark, and under stones, are numerous.  COLLECTING INSTRUxMENTS.  The collector of Coleoptera will require three nets : a large one,  fourteen inches in dia-meter, made of thick white muslin, of strong  construction, suitable for beating the bushes or for taking specimens  on the wing, provided with a handle not more than fourteen or  eighteen inches long; a smaller one, ten or twelve inches in diameter,  also of strong construction, with a bag of millinet, suitable for raking  up material from the bottom of ponds, streams, &c. ; and a third, with  a long handle, provided with a bag of gauze for catching cicindelre,  (the actively flying species seen in roads.) These nets are suitable  for the collection of all inserts, and their form and construction have  been described under the directions given regarding other orders.  A very convenient bag may be made for beating bushes, &c., out  of a bar hinged at two places, so as to form an isosceles triangle ;  the long legs serve as handles, and the bag of muslin may be fastened  to the short leg and the bases of the long ones. An umbrella frame  covered with v/hite muslin also answers an excellent purpose.  Much may be done in the collection of minute Coleoptera by passing  the material washed up by the waves of a lake or stream, or the earth  of an ant's nest, through a sieve having not very fine meshes ; the  material passing through is received on a sheet of paper or a hand-  kerchief, gently pressed, and then watched carefully for a few moments;  the insects may be detected by the moving of particles, and can then  be easily secured.  METHOD OF PRESERVING SPECIMENS.  A. For Transportation.  Coleoptera obtained on journeys, where economy of time and space  is of importance, should be always placed in strong alcohol. The  bottles to receive them should be small, not more than eight ounce  bottles for large species, and one ounce or smaller for the minute  ones. Wlien the bottles are filled with specimens, the liquid should  be poured off and re])laced by strong alcohol; thus the specimens will  be rendered firm and can be preserved indefinitely. Tlie colors do not  change.  If bottles are in danger of being broken, the specimens, after re-  maining for a day or two in alcohol, may be taken out, partially  dried by exposure to the air, but not so as to be brittle, and then  paci^-sd in layers in small boxes between soft paper ; the boxes should  then be carfully closed with gum paper or paste, so as to exclude all  enemies.  11   162 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.   B. For Collections.  Where the specimens are intended to be placed immediately in a  cabinet, the smaller species should not be put in spirits, but rather  in homoeopathic vials, in each of which is a small piece of bibulous  paper moistened with ether. Thus the specimens do not become wet,  and can be gummed on cards without delay.  Pinning. â€” Coleopterous insects, more than one-tenth of an inch  long, unless of very narrow form, should be pinned through the right  elytron, in such manner that the pin passes out beneath, between the  middle and posterior coxa of the right side ; the pin must be graduated  to the size of the specimen. German pins alone should be used ; they  are not so long and of harder and more elastic metal than the French,  and much better j)ointed. Short English pins should always be  avoided ; they bring the specimen too close to the bottom of the box.  Insects less than a tenth of an inch long, or very narrow species of  larger size, must be gummed on cards, which are placed on pins of  No. 1 or No. 2. For economy in travelling, several cards may be  placed on one pin, in which case the cards should be larger and put  on No. 3 pins ; they can afterwards be cut down to the proper size.  I have found the most convenient method of preparing cabinet  specimens to be the following : Cut thin Bristol board into strips  about one-fifth of an inch wide ; from these, with sharp-pointed  dissecting scissors, cut small isosceles triangles, in number equal to  the specimens to be prepared ; place each one on a pin about three-  fourths of its height ; then selecting the specimen to be prepared,  arrange the feet and antennae v*'ith two camel's hair pencils, or with  one pencil and a pin ; clip the end of the triangle so as to give a base  about one-third or one-fourth of the length of the insect, holding the  pin with the card in the left hand ; touch the tip of the card with a  pin dipped in the cement, then lifting the insect with a moistened  pencil, place it at right angles to the altitude of the triangle and on  the left hand of the pin ; this position^ if neatly given, and without  any superfluity of cement, enables the under surface of the specimen  to be very thoroughly examined.  The best cement is a mixture of inspissated ox gall, gum arable,  and water, and should be so thick that the specimen will remain in  the position in which it is placed. Gum arabic alone is too brittle ; the  specimens prepared with it are apt to come off. Gum mixed with a  little brown sugar answers very well ; so does the common mucilage  of the shops.  Setting. â€” The antennae and feet of small specimens should be drawn  out so as to enable them to be examined when necessary; of large  specimens, they should be moved with brushes or fine forceps, with  the same object in view. Any system of regular setting such as is  adopted by English collectors of bringing the feet and antenna3_ as  nearly as possible on a plane with the body is reprehensible ; nothing  can be more awkward than the appearance of a box of specimens trais  prepared, and the specimens themselves are much more liable to injury.  The posture should be as nearly as practicable that assumed by the   INSTEUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 1G3  animal when moving, and the legs should therefore be in a somewhat  depending position.  Cabinets. -The specimens should be preserved, either in drawers with  tight covers in which are fitted panes of glas^, or in boxes with very  carefully fitting covers which lift off; boxes in the form of books are  also used, but the cover being affixed to the box is in the way of the  student. I have found that the best size for boxes required for con-  stant study is 12 inches by 8|- or 9 inches, (inside measurement ;) the  depth is to be proportioned to pins used, but one inch and a half clear  of the cork, with which the bottom is lined, will be fouKd ample. The  boxes should be made of thin, well seasoned board, so that they will  not become warped, lined with sheets of cork, such as used for boot  soles, then neatly papered, and kept horizontally in a piece of furni-  ture made for the purpose, the doors of which fit very closely by means  of a tongue and groove running all around. Camphor should be kept  always in abundance in the boxes or in the cabinet alongside of the  boxes, and during the warm season every box should be looked at at  least once in each month. The presence of infection is seen by the  dust at tlie bottom of the pin bearing the infected specimen ; this  should at once be removed and dipped in alcohol or boiling water.  Where it can be procured, henzine is the best material to use ; it is to  bo applied with a pencil over the whole surface, and then the speci-  men is to be brushed with a clean pencil. Such preparation is con-  sidered in Paris to protect the specimen ever afterwards from infection.  I have tried various poisonous solutions, such as tinctures of strych-  nine, picrotoxine, piperine, &c., without avail. Arseniate of potassa.  will protect the specimens but injure the appearance very much.  When a specimen is badly gummed or pinned, it is to be thrown in  boiling water for a short time, varying from half a minute to five  minutes, depending on the size of the specimen, and the pin or card  can then be removed, and the specimen repinned or reset on a clean  card.  For the purpose of distinguishing specimens from different regions,,  little disks of variously colored paper may be used ; they are easily  made by a small punch, and should be kept in wooden pill boxes ready  for use ; at the same time a key to the colors, showing the regions  embraced by each, should be made on the fly leaf of the catalogue of  the collection, or in the Melsheimer catalogue, so as to be ever at hand  for persons consulting the collection.  The specimens should all be pinned at the same height; the ease  of recognizing species allied in characters is greatly increased by hav-  ing them on the same level, and a general appearance of neatness is  given which cannot otherwise be obtained.  It is better, even where numbers with reference to a catalogue are  employed, that the name of each species should be written on a label  attached to the first specimen. Thus the eye is familiarized with the  association of the species and its name, memory is aided, and a greater  power given of identifying species when the cabinet is not at hand.  No manual applicable to the Coleojjtera of the United States has  yet been prepared ; such a work is much needed, as the student is now  obliged either to seek in a large number of works the information he   164 IKSTEUCTIONS FOE COLLECTING INSECIS.  desires, or to rely on his specimens being named by some person wbo  has already mastered the difficulties of this bibliographical maze.  HYMENOPTERA.*  The Hymenoptera are insects furnished with /owr memhranous ivings,  and â– which, in general, are capable of wounding by means of a siing,  such as the wasps, hornets, bees, ichneumons, &c. They should be  taken in a net or in pill boxes, but never more than a single insect  should be put in one box.  They are found on flowers, bushes, and on walls, exposed to the sun  or warmed declivities, in sandy places and in the earth. Their  j)resence is often at once recognized by the existence of numerous  holes in sandy places or in walls forming their habitations or the  places where their young are deposited ; all the ants belong to this  order of insects. When an ant's nest has been found it is necessary  to open it in order to secure a large number of individuals ; in the  interior, individuals with wings are found ; these are the males and  females, which it is very important to obtain.  The collector should secure the nests of Hymenoptera ; they will be  found fixed to the roofs of houses, in the holes of trees, pendent from  branches, &c. The nests are often closed and have but one orifice ; this  may be frequently stopped up and the branch containing it cut off and  secured with all its contents. When they are more fragile they should  .be carried in boxes, with which the collector should provide himself  for this purpose, and protected by means of cotton or soft moss. It  is very important to know what are the species which construct these  nests, and it is therefore indispensable either to pin the insect and in-  clude the nest on the same pin, or fix the tv/o on pins designated by  the same number.  The collector should make a record of his observations, designating  the individuals by numbers in case he is unacquainted with their  names, and note the peculiarities of their habitations, their prey, their  utility or their injurious qualities or habits, &c.  Hymenoptera should be set in the same manner as the Diptera, and  should be killed by means of the fumes of sulphur or with chloroform.  The legs should be placed in a natural position, and the tongue  pushed forward so that this important organ, when present, as in bees,  vmay be easily examined.  ORTHOPTERA.t (Linn.)  Earwigs, cockroaches, spectres or walking-sticks, praying-mantes,  grasshoppers, katydids, crickets, &c., belong to this order; their  habits are generally to feed upon vegetable matter of all kinds, and  some of them, as the cockroaches, prey upon various materials of food  in houses, &c. ... , , .

Cockroaches of various kinds may be found beneath sticks, stones,  rubbish, &c., and under the bark of decayed trees, mostly in damp  situations.  Spectres or walking-sticks are to be found upon trees and shrubbery,  and require very close searching to discover them, their color being  generally so much like that of the bark or twigs of the trees they  inhabit.  Praying-mantes are usually most abundant in gardens upon all  sorts of vegetable matter, and, being large and conspicuous objects,  may be readily seen and captured with the hands or net. Their time  of appearing is from the middle of July to the end of summer.  Grasshoppers are abundant everywhere ; some of the species fly very  swiftly, and can only be obtained by following them with the net. The  species are usually most numerous upon heaths, commons, and fields  of grass. There are also a few kinds found jumping about near the  margins of streams upon bare sandy places not covered by the water  at high tide. These insects may be found during the whole year, but  their numbers greatly increase as the warm weather comes on.  Katydids live upon trees and high shrubbery, and may be best  collected by beating into an umbrella ; this must be done quickly,  however, as they very soon recover from the effects of their fall, and  their long legs enable them to jump to great distances ; their time of  appearing is late in the summer or early part of autumn.  Crickets are found the whole year round under logs, slicks, and  stones ; their numbers are considerably increased by the early part of  autumn, when they may be collected by sweeping from the grass, &c.  All the kinds of insects before enumerated may be placed in alcohol  and sufiered to remain in it for a considerable time without much  change in their colors ; it is very necessary, however, to have the  bottles filled quite full in order to transport them ; shaking about  separates the parts, &c.  This order of insects may be collected during the entire year, but  the best times are in the warm parts of spring and autumn ; at these  seasons their eggs are generally laid and the creatures arrive at their  full state of perfection.  SEMIPTERA.  This order includes what are ])roperly so called bugs, harvest flies,  or cicadas, (improperly called locusts,) tree-hoppers, vine-hoppers,  plant-lice, &c. The bugs are divided into terrestrial and aquatic.  The terrestrial kinds are all found during the warm weather upon  vegetable matter, and may be collected in all the ordinary ways, sha-  king into an umbrella, sweeping from the grass and low plants with  a net, picking up with the hands, &c. The aquatic species can be  obtained by fishing with a net amongst the mud at the bottom of  ponds and streams and amongst water plants, and some are found   166 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  Bkimming over the surface of the water. There are also a few kinds  to be obtained from the banks of streams in the sand and among the  stones, under the bark of decayed trees^ &c.  All the remaining insects of this order may be found on trees and  plants, some living upon the leaves and others upon the trunk and  stems ; they may be captured by beating into an umbrella or sweep-  ing with a net. Grape-vines will be found specially productive.  Their time of appearance is during the warm weather, from the begin-  ning of summer to the end of autumn.  NEUROPTERA.  Dragon Flies, Ephemerce or May Flies, Lace-ivinged Flies, Ant  Lions, White Ants, Caddis-worm Flies , {Pliryganidce,) Scorpion Flies,  &c. â€” Dragon Flies inhabit the water in their first stages, and the  perfect insect will be found most numerous in the vicinity of pools,  marshes, and watery places. They are found only during the warm  weather of spring and summer. The best method of collecting them  is to station yourself close to the bushes, sticks, &c., upon which  they settle, and wait till they alight, when the net may be thrown over  them. A little practice, however, will enable you to capture them  upon the wing, and by this means you will secure many rare species  which could not be otherwise obtained. These insects had better not  be placed in alcohol, as it will soon destroy their colors, and render  them valueless ; the best method yet discovered is to have little paper  bags adapted to the size of the insects, into which they may be slipped  after closing their wings against each other, and having wetted their  bodies all over with alcohol by means of a camel's hair pencil, which,  together with a small vial containing the alcohol, may be carried in  the pocket.  The Agrionidce, sometimes called Darning-needles, must be treated  differently ; it will not do to place tliem in papers ; they must be  pierced through with a pin and then stuck into the hat, a box, or  something the collector must carry for the purpose. They are usually  very abundant in meadows, near small brooks, ditches, &c., settling  upon bushes and projecting objects.  EphemercB are generally best collected during the evening. The  young of these and the Caddis-worm flies inhabit the water, and near  it the imago will be found, sometimes in immense flocks, each one  making a gyratory motion and flying with prodigious swiftness,  usually around some adjacent tree. They must be collected with the  net and pinned at once.  Lace-winged Flies are to be found upon trees, plants, &c., and, with  the Scorpion Flies, may be beaten into the umbrella or swept into the  net. Ail the remaining insects of this order, together with these two  kinds of flies, must be pinned at once, and not placed in bags or  alcohol.  Ant Lions will be found flying about near the margins of woods and  in sandy places, near fences, &c. They are distinguished from the  Dragon flies by the greater length of their antenna?, which always   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 167  have a knob at the end. They must be killed, like the Dragon flies,  by applying alcohol with a brush.  Whife Ants will be found swarming in decayed logs, beneath stones,  â– &C. They are very tender, and must be pinned at once. The insects  of this order live during the warm weather only, and can be collected  in the greatest numbers when the sun shines warmest and the days  are fine. Many of them may be obtained by spreading a sheet in the  woods or near some stream, among the bushes, during the night, and  placing over it a bulls-eye lantern ; the insects will be attracted by  the light, and by means of the white sheet they can be more readily  seen and taken with the net. This is also a most excellent method of  mothhvj during the hot summer evenings.   INSTEUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING DIPTERA.   BY H. LOEW, WITH ADDITIONS BY R. OSTENSACKEN.   The first instrument I use in a locality, the fauna of which I am not  well acquainted with, is a linen bag, fourteen inches in diameter and  two and a half feet long, a little rounded at the top or apex, and  attached to a strong iron ring, with a hollow metallic handle, in which,  if necessary, a cane or other piece of wood may be inserted. With  this bag I begin to sweep, and in a short time ascertain what insects  abound in the grass, on the flowers, or in moist or dry places, &c.  After the last sweep, by a dexterous twist of the handle I throw the  apex of the sack over the ring, so as to prevent the escape of the  insects, and give them time to compose themselves at the bottom. It  is then opened, and I insert my head into it to see what I have cap-  tured. They immediately begin to move upwards. The common  specimens I allow to pass ; but if there is one which I desire to take,  I let it advance to the middle of the bag, and then gently grasp it,  from the outside of the bag, with the right hand. The other captives  I drive down to the bottom by blowing moderately on them, and con-  fine them there by letting the ring fall over the right hand, which  holds the insect, which is now easily seized with the left hand. This  operation is repeated until everything desirable is taken out, when the  bag is emptied of its contents by inversion, and the sweeping recom-  menced.  This is the most important of all the implements used by the Dip-  terologist. Its employment prevents him from wasting his time iu  barren localities, promptly indicates the presence of rare species, and,  by furnishing this information, enables him afterwards to have an  abundance of specimens.  When I have, by the use of the bag, discovered the locality of rari-  ties, I use another instrument, which is nothing more than an ordi-  nary insect- forceps, of the form shown in fig. 1. Here, h is the placo  for the thumb, c is the joint placed near the handle in order that the   168   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.    forceps may be closed rapidly ; the remaining portion of the arma  should be made so stout that they will not spring when closing the  blades ; c? is a pin to prevent lateral motion when the blades are closed;  a the oval ring  must be covered  with a double cot-  ton tape tightly  sewed. If the for-  ceps are not more  j^ (, -^ than nine or ten in-  ] ches long the ring  need scarcely be  bound with tape. Its  angle and straight  side are useful in  capturing insects in particular situations. Then the space between the  rings, on their internal side, must be covered with the best bobbinet,  tightly drawn and securely sewed, so that a perfectly level surface be  formed, in order to prevent the captured insect from struggling. The  insect is pinned through the openings of the bobbinet, and is then  easily transferred to the collecting box, or stuck into the sides or top of  your hat, at pleasure. Two views of the instrument are given to  illustrate its form more fully.  This instrument is not adapted for very small insects. For such, a  forceps with finer bobbinet is used, but even this is superfluous, if you  have become expert in employing the bag in sweeping, as well as in  holding it under plants, bushes, and flowers, and, by gently striking  or shaking them, allowing the insects to fall into it. Neither does it  answer for the capture of very active species. It is, for the most part,  useless to pursue such, and only betrays the intemperate zeal of the  beginner. It is better to ascertain where such species pass the night,  and thus you can easily capture that with your fingers which at other  times would cost much labor. An excursion early in the morning,  before the dew is off, is often very productive.  To carry more instruments with you than those just mentioned is  an unnecessary burden.  Besides the capture, the breeding of Diptera, is of the greatest im-  portance, and, for the most part, easy. The principal rule I follow,  in order to secure the perfect insect, is, to be in no hurry about  taking the imperfect one. If there is reason to presume that the  larvfe will change into the pupa state at the place where it is fonnd,  I wait until then and gather the pupas. On a contrary presump-  tion, I take the larvae only when I observe that they are preparing for  the pupa state. Decaying wood, mould in hollow trees, manure, and  ground-earth under manure, stems of plants, grass, stalks of hollow  weeds, dried flowers and their seed vessels, particularly of the Co7n-  posifce, furnish me the richest booty.  A bag full of the dried flowers of the Compositce, or a bundle of dry  burdocks and thistles, which I have had gathered for a few pennies, has  always furnished me with something good. The pupfe of Diptera do   INSTRUCTIONS FOE COLLECTING INSECTS. 1G9  not require raucli care ; only do not let the place in which, they are  kept be too warm. Those I wish to separate are put in large glass  jars, the tops of which are covered with paper. The others I place in  a wooden box, which I keep in an unheated room, on the window-sill.  AVhen they are developed from the pupa towards spring, they natu-  rally fly to the window, from which I take them with a glass vial, or,  what is better, with a small chip-box furnished with a glass bottom.  The third point of great importance is the preparation and pinning  of the specimens for the cabinet. Sulphuric ether and chloroform are  but inferior means of killing them. Specimens too long exposed to  these agents are apt to spoil, and, if too little exposed to them, they  revive. They answer only for certain tender minute species, of which  I shall speak below. The best means of killing them are kreosote and  the smoke of a strong cigar. The general rule is, to pin the flies  whilst living, and thus to put them into the collecting box, which,  should have the bottom well moistened with kreosote, and be made  tight. The captives will soon die, and thus, time after time, fresh  subjects may be put in as they are caught. I have had boxes in which  the largest Diptera were almost immediately killed, although the kreo-  sote had not been renewed for six days, and which were still fatal to  smaller species for six months afterwards. If you have no boxes thus  prepared with kreosote, or, if you wish to avoid the odor of it, then  prepare a box, so that, when it is full of pinned specimens, you may  blow a few strong puffs of cigar-smoke into it, and all life will soon  cease.  In the pinning of specimens, the long pins are greatly to be ^'s- -â€¢  preferred to the short ones. Five-sixths of all the entomolo- Â®'  gists now use the long pins, m n, fig. 2, is the normal length 1 d  of pins v/hich are used for Diptera ; the finer kinds may be of \\7)  the length m d. The insects must be pushed high enough up  the pin to enable the surface of its back to be examined with an  ordinary lens witliout being incommoded by the pin's head.  The back of the insect must, of course, be a little nearer the  pin's head than the length of the focus of the glass. As smaller  insects must be examined by glasses of higher power, they must  be brought nearer the pin's head than larger ones.  Large flies may be pushed up so that their backs come to h, <^ '  which smaller ones should reach a. Since the beautiful magni-  fiers of Oberhauser, which allow the application of a lower power,  have come into use, insects may be pinned at a greater distance from  the head, but not much greater.  The minute and tender species, such as the smallest Cecldomyke,  Campy lomjza', and others, must be treated difierently. They cannot  be pinned in the ordinary way with safety. Van Heyden has pro-  posed the most rational and elegant method. The smaller species are  caught by the linen bag, and are then put into very porous chip pill  boxes, and are killed with cigar smoke, if boxes moistened with  kreosote are not preferred. When twenty or thirty are captured the  box is turned up so that specimens fall into the cover. They are then  transfixed from below on fine silver wire, but not so as to allow the  wire to project beyond the thorax. The silver wire must previously   170 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  \"be cut with ordinary scissors into pieces of proper length and taken  with you. The wire must be inserted into the insect by means of a  very delicate pincers, and with the same instrument the other end of  the wire must he stuck into a hox, the bottom of which is covered  smoothly with the pith of plants. Over the pith thin paper may be  fastened in order to render the surface still more smooth. The top or  cover of the pill box, in which the insects are placed while transfix-  ing them, must not be too shallow, so that they may not be blown  away by the wind, if the operation is performed in the field. The use  of a glass vial for the capture of small insects is not to be recommend,  as the moisture separates their parts and thus spoils them. The vial  may be used on excursions, when you desire to take home a single  living insect for the purpose of examining the organs of its mouth or  its internal structure.  Those specimens which have been transfixed on the silver wire, as  above indicated, are prepared for the collection in the following way :  In the fall, stalks of weeds with pith not too porous, and before it is quite  dry, must be collected. The best adapted for this purpose is the pith of  Artemisia, and, still better, of Verhascum, (mullein.) It is cut into small  Fig. 3. .1 n pieces, which, seen from above, have the form and size of  Fi 4 ] ^ fig. 3, and seen from the side the thickness of fig. 4. Then  \" ^ insect pins of moderate size are inserted through these  Fig. 5. small pieces at the place indicated by the dot, (fig. 5,) and the  pieces are pushed up nearly to the ])in's head. As the pith  is still moist it will adhere to the pin in drying, and by the  slight coat of verdigris which will soon be developed, the  insects, which have been previously attached to the silver wire  are now inserted on the free end of the pith with the delicate  pincers, where they will stick fast enough if the proper kind  of pith has been used. Pith of Samhucus, or elder, Edianthns,  or sunflower, and similar plants, do not answer the purpose,  because it is too porous. The insect should stand a little  higher than the head of the pin, so that it may be conve-  niently examined from all sides. The silver wire used for this purpose  should be of the very best quality so as to prevent the development  of verdigris.  In regard to the Tipularia, and some others, whose legs easily break  oft', my method is the following : I capture them with the forceps and  pin them as other large specimens. Before pinning, I press the thorax,  so as to prevent all struggling ; I then stick the pin through a piece  of paper of this form, (fig. 6.) and push it up far  enough to receive the legs of the insect neatly spread  out or turned under it. When the insect is dead I  remove the paper, which, however, might as well  be suffered to remain.  The boxes in which Diptera are kept should be  about a foot square, the top should be glass, and  made to fit tight to the other part by a double rab-    INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING IN.SECTS. 171  \"bet. Rome persons, in addition, fasten the cover down by means of  brass hooks, to prevent warping, (fig. 7.) Fig. 7.  The boxes may be made of any well seasoned  wood. The bottom of the boxes should be  made of wood cut liorizontally from the trunk  in plates one-fourth to one-third of an inch  thick, and in this case we may use the harder  kinds of wood from deciduous leaved trees,  except when the rings making the last growth  of the year are very hard, or else a very soft wood may be used, such  as the partially decayed wood of dead linden or poplar trees ; but the  pieces are cut out lengthwise in the ordinary way. In both cases the  finest pins can be easily inserted into the wood without risk of injuring  their j'oints and hold very well. But in the latter mentioned kind of  bottom a fine pin readily takes a wrong direction, and after having  been taken out it is difficult to insert it again in a perpendicular posi-  tion. The use of soft material for lining the bottom of the boxes has  been generally abandoned in the best collections. It is only when  perfectly tight boxes cannot be procured that the lining is used, and  then not so much with reference to the insertion of the pin as to facili-  tate the poisoning of the box and to exclude the acari, psoci, and other  insects. The best material for this purpose is blotting paper spread  over with mercurial ointment, and over this is laid a fine oiled silk of  light color. The oiled silk may be faintly ruled with cross lines to  facilitate the symmetrical arrangements of the S2)ecimens. If the oiled  silk is fine enough it offers no perceptible resistance to the finest pin.  But a more serious inconvenience is, that it prevents us from seeing  the texture of the wood at the place where the pin is to be inserted,  and hence the points of the very fine pins are liable to injury. On  this account it is much better to use wooden boxes without any lining,  and these when neatly made look well enough. But if it is deemed  desirable to still further improve the appearance of the boxes, a sheet  of thin paper may be spread over the bottom, provided the texture of  the wood is very uniform or very fine pins are not to be used. This  paper may be renewed from time to time, and should be fastened by  glue and not by paste, which only furnishes a bait for destructive  insects.  If it is deemed advisable to poison the boxes, it is most conveniently  done by means ot bits of felt smeared with mercurial ointment, which  are fastened in the covers. During the examination of the insects the  covers may be set aside, if any injury to the health is apprehended ;  but of this there is not the slightest danger.  In securing the insects in the collection there is one indispensable  rule : nothing should touch the bottom. The labels of genera and  species, as well as those on the pin, with each specimen, should be as  high as possible ; the first being nearly on a level in the specimen.  The labels are best made of stout paper, as they are then better  kept in position on pins of moderate thickness.   172   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.    the aid of pincers.   Fig. 9.

The handle should hs  large enough to allow a firm grasp of the hand,  and the h ranches should he kept constantly a  little separated by means of a spring, as repre-  sented. The jaws of the pincers should be  roughened like a file on the inside at the ends,  and they may be either straight, or, still better,  slightly curved, (fig. 9,) as in the figure, to  admit of being passed more readily beneath the  insect.  The cases used on excursions, or entomologi-  cal trips, are difl'erently constructed from  those of the cabinet. The Ijottom must be lined  with a material soft enough to allow every pin,  even the finest, to be inserted easily without  The best material for this end is pasteboard,  which is cut in narrow strips glued against each other, so as to be in  a position perpendicular to the bottom of the box.  ^'s-'i-(>- The bottom of the box is lined with  these strips, so that the pins move between  the layers of the pasteboard. To prevent  the pins so loosely inserted from dropping  out, the lining should be sufficiently thick,  and, at the same time, the box low enough  to allow the head of the loosening pin to  lean against the cover before dropping.  (See fig. 10.)  Note by B. OstensacJcen. â€” Collectors of  Diptera should always endeavor to obtain  both sexes of every species. The sexes in  the families of the Tipulidae and of the  Asilidae (for the greater part) are easily  distinguished by the form of the abdomen,  which is generally club-shaped or obtuse  in the male, and more or less pointed in the female. In other fami-  lies {Tabani, Syrphi, StraHomijdae, Bomhjlii, and in most of the true  Muscidae) the eyes are close together in the male, and separated by  the \"front\" in the female. Sometimes they are separated in both  sexes, but then the front of the male is generally narrower than that  of the female. If these characters fail to help in distinguishing the  sexes, the size, and especially the shape, of the abdomen will be suffi-  cient. The males are, for the most part, smaller than the females,  and have the abdomen more slender.  It often happens that one of the sexes appears in great abundance,  while not a single specimen of the other can be sean. In such cases    INSTEUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 173  the following observations of Dr. Schiener (Wiener Entomol. Monat-  schrift, 1858, p. 175) may prove useful :  \"From manifold and repeated experience I have arrived at the con-  clusion that whenever one sex of a Dipterous insect appears in great  numbers, the other is always to be found somewhere in the immediate  neighborhood.  \"If the males soar in the air we can generally predict with certainty  that the females are not far off quietly reposing on trunks of trees, as  is the case with the AniJwmyzidce, or on the under side of leaves, as  witli the SyrpMdie.  \"If every indication of the resting place fails, I then commence  catching everything living and flying in the immediate vicinity,  sweeping in the air and shaking or beating the leaves and grass, and  in this way I have generally succeeded in obtaining, among one hun-  dred specimens of the one sex, at least one of the other.  \"The males soaring on the tops of mountains are generally isolated,  but on descending several hundred feet w^e will seldom look in vain for  the other sex resting on leaves or the heads of umbelliferous plants.  \"I have even succeeded, by patient perseverance, in discovering  single males among the numerous female horse-flies (Tahani) which  attack cattle.\"  Those who wish more detailed information about the localities where  rare species of Diptera have to be looked for will find them in Bremi's  excellent paper on this subject, (Isis^ 1846, p. IGo,) as well as in an  article of Mr. Hoffmeister, in the \"Entomologische Zeitung\" of  Stettin, 1844, p. 360.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING LEPIDOPTERA.   BY BRACKINRIDGE CLEMENS, M. D.   This order of insects includes the butterflies, sphinges, and moths,  and is divided by systematists into two very distinct and easily recog-  nised sections.  The members of the first are known as diurnal Lepidoptera, or  Bhopaloccra, and are characterized by possessing a7itennce that are  always club-shaped at the extremity, by their diurnal Jiight, and the  wings being held elevated during repose. They are commonly desig-  nated butterflies, and their diurnal habits and beauty render them  familiar objects to the most casual observer. Their natural history,  also, is much better known than that of the members of the second  great group under this order, the great majority of those belonging to  the United States having been described in Boisduval and Leconte's  Iconographie dcs Lepidoptercs de I'Amerique Septentrionale, and in  the works of the older entomologists, Cramer, Drury, &g. There  are, however, doubtless, many species still undescribed, but the writer  wishes to direct special attention to the individuals of the following  group, which, being far more unfrequently the objects of attention,   174 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  are but little known, and it is particularly to tliem tliat the following  instructions must be understood to apply, while at the same time they  are applicable to the diurnal species.  The second section, to which the attention of students and observers  is specially called, is composed of the sphinges, or haiak-moths, and  millers or moths, and known as Heterocera. Their antennce are of vari-  ous forms, and never dub-shaped at the extremity; their flight is usually  nocturnal, and their icings, in repose, ivith a feio exceptions, are flat.  The merest novice in entomology, by keeping in mind these marks of  distinction, can have no difficulty in recognizing the members! of these  two great groups. The nocturnal lepidoptera or heterocera differ  greatly in size, some being very large and beautiful; others, again,  are small, even minute, and their colors frequently sombre and dull ;  but it is hoped that none will be neglected on account of this diminutive  size or unattractive appearance. When, however, the specimens are  minute a certain degree of manipulative delicacy, acquired by prac-  tice, is requisite either to pin them successfully or to set the wings  subsequently. For this purpose small pins, manufactured especially  for this use, may be procured. Those made in London are preferable  either to the German or French.  now TO COLLECT LEPIDOPTERA.  The body and wings of lepidoptera are covered by minute scales,  which are attached by a slender stalk to the external surface. They  are easily detached from their connections, and it is very important  that the collector should avoid, as much as possible, denuding the  surface whilst taking specimens, or manipulating them alter their  capture. Badly denuded specimens are quite worthless, because,  when the peculiar markings or ornamentation of the wings are effaced  or injured, they are not attractive objects for the cabinet, and if new,  a good specific description cannot be made from them. This caution  should attract, therefore, the particular attention of every one who  undertakes to collect. Moths shoidd never he taken by the wings ivith  the fingers. If no other means of securing them is at hand, it is far  better to permit them to enjoy their life and liberty than to endeavor  to make specimens of Avhat would be only an incumbrance to any col-  lection. When it is necessary to seize them, either for the purpose of  pinning or to cripple them after capture, it must be done according to  a prescribed mode, in the application of which the specimen is sub-  jected to the least possible injury. In order to accomplish this the  insect is seized firmly with the thumb and forefinger by the sides of  the thorax, beneath the ivings, or, rather, in such a manner as to elevate  them and hold them immovable. The pressure is applied at the base  of the wings, and must be firm and steady, for the insect is able to  make strong resistance with the muscles of the thorax, and is liable  to escape.  It would, perhaps, he proper to mention here that two divisions of  lepidoptera are frequently mentioned by name in entomological works,  the one as macro-lepidoptera, including the rhopalocera, s])hinges,  bombyces, geometrides, and noctuides ; the other as micro-lepidoptera   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 175  Trhicli is composed of the pyrolides, tortrices, tineides, oteropliorides,  and alucitides. Some of the macro-lepidoptera, however, are of small  size, whilst, on the other hand, many ot the '^micros\" are comparatively  large ; but there is a certain convenience in the use of the terms, as  standards of comparative size, which renders their occurrence quite  frequent.  The implement most used in capturing lepidoptera is the ring-net,  made as will be herealter described. By means of this they are taken  on the wing, and as they hover over or after having alighted on flow-  ers, leaves, &c. The requisite dexterity in using it efficiently is soon  acquired by practice, and a little experience respecting the habits and  mode of the flight of the objects sought. \"When the insect is once with-  in the net it can be kept quiet and at the bottom, by keeping it in  motion from side to side, so as to permit the air to rush through its open  end. But how can the specimen be secured with the least amount of  injury? There are several ways by which this can be accomplished.  When the specimen is of large size the net should be seized with the  left hand in such a manner as to jn'event fluttering as much as pos-  sible, and to guard against its pushing itself into the folds ; and it is  then seized by the thorax with the thumb and forefinger of the right  hand in the manner heretofore described, and smartly squeezed so as  to crush it and thus deprive it of life ; or it may be touched on the  head through the net with tlie glass stopper of a bottle containing  chloroform ; the bottle having been shaken previously to removing the  stopper it will carry enough to benumb completely the largest moth  after two or three successive applications. I much prefer this to com-  pression of the thorax, although the insect usually revives, but this  can be prevented after pinning by using some one of the poisons to be  hereafter mentioned. The eflect of chloroform applied thus is almost  instantaneously to quiet the most violent flatterer, nor is it necessary  that any other portion of the insect than the head should be wetted by it.  When the captive is a ''' micro,\" it may be prevented from escap-  ing by blowing a vigorous stream of breath on it through the open end  of the net; but if it proves to be too strong to be kept down thus, the  net must be immediately put in motion again to prevent its escape,  turning the open end alternately Irom one side to the other. After  throwing the specimen well in the apex by this means, my own mode  of operation is to grasp it with the left hand, taking care to have the  thumb and first finger upward, just above the specimen, and thus close  the net. Then by elevating the hand through the ring or on a level  with it, a common cupping glass of about two inches diameter, or a icine  glass, carried in the pocket, is })laccd on the top of the left hand over  the constricted portion, the grasp relaxed, and the insect permitted to  escape through the opening into its interior. The glass is then closed  below by the left hand on the outside of the net_, and may be trans-  ferred to the top of the collecting box, where it can be quieted with  chloroform and pinned. All lepidoptera, except those of large size,  can be easily secured thus, and without in the least stripping any por-  tion of the body of its scales. The smaller tortrices and tineae, which  can be kept within the net by blowing, may be likewise secured by the  glass, which is placed over them as they sit on or ascend the sides of   176 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  the net, and I much prefer it to the ordinary mode of securing them in  'pill boxes. The English entomologists all use the pill box, I believe,  to secure a micro after it is witliin the net, but it involves the neces-  sity of carrying a great many of them in the pockets, and the trouble  of killing one's captures after returning from the field wearied with  exercise. Therefore I much prefer to kill and pin on the field, although  to accomplish the latter satisfactorily often re(][uires, in consequence of  the minuteness of the objects, a steady hand.  When walking over grassy meadows or amongst low herbage I am  in the habit of using the net by siueeping, and to very great advantage.  This operation is performed by giving the net an alternate right and  left motion as the collector walks forward, keeping the open end in-  clined at about an angle of 45Â° to the plane of the surface, touching  with the lovv^er part of the ring the tops of the grass and herbage, and  as the net distends itself with air, being careful that the apex does not  drag or strike when it is turned at the extreme right and left points  of the sweep. The motion should be gentle and continuous, and the  mouth of the net merely reversed in the alternation, so that the apex  is kept constantly flying in the air and free from contact with any sur-  rounding bodies. By this means he secures everything that rises as  he advances, and after every half dozen sweeps the net is brought to  the face, and a stream of breath blown into it whilst the collector in-  spects the interior. Should it contain anything he desires, it may be  selected, or even a half a dozen \" micros\" secured one after the other  Tby means of his glass, and all brought at the same time to the top  of his collecting box in the most perfect condition. In this manner I  have often collected 150 specimens during a few hours' walk in the  afternoon and evening. The operation may riot be made very com-  prehensible by description, but a few endeavors to practice it, will  soon put tbe collector in possession of the art. Of course, sweeping is  inapplicable when the grass and herbage are wet with dew.  In addition to these means of collecting, the \" micros\" may be taken  in pill boxes wherever they may be seen, should the net not be at hand,  and the collector will find it advantageous always to carry a few in his  pocket during the entire collecting season.  The loide-mouthed bottle, presently to be referred to, forms an excel-  lent collecting agent in the field, or to capture those which are attracted  to ourroomsby light during the nights of summer. Ov iha cupping-  glass or ivine-glass will enable one to secure many exquisite specimens  in the field during the hot, sultry days of June and July, when they  will be found on the leaves of the herbage of the cool, shady wood,  gamboling over their surfaces like veritable elves, or so immovable  that they seem to be enjoying an afternoon siesta, or feasting on odor-  ous wild flowers. In using the glass for this purpose, the object must  be gently approached so as not to alarm it, and the glass cautiously  advanced until it is just over the spot occupied by the specimen, whilst  the left hand is advanced beneath ; the glass is then brought down  rapidly over the object upon the left hand which closes it, and if you  have struck skilfully, secures you perhaps a rare species in all its  original beauty.  The collector will soon ascertain what are the most productive   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 177  localities in his neighborliood, and where particular species are to be  had in greatest abundance. When these are once ascertained, let him  learn to hunt quietly, and endeavor to bring into exercise his powers  of observation ; never moving until he has scanned every leaf and  object around him, noting the habits of the little people of the great  unknown world by which he is surrounded, their peculiar mode of  flight and concealing themselves, and the situations which appear  most agreeable to them. His net should always be in readiness to se-  cure everything which his motions and footsteps may startle, but should  he fail, let him not, to the infinite alarm of the minute inhabitants of  the forest, rush headlong after it through brambles, herbage, and  grass, and over the decayed trunks of trees, striking frantically this way  and that, until he glows with a heat above the summer point, and is  bathed in perspiration and fairly disgusted with Entomology, which  involves so many discomforts. Let him rather be self-possessed and  cool, mark where the coveted object alights, and he can easily secure  it without affecting the steadiness of his nerves, and perhaps rendering  the specimen worthless subsequently, during the operation of pinning.  This, of course, is advice to the incipient collector.  The nocturnal Lepidoptera maybe taken by stratagem as well as by  coup de main. Prominent among the expedients used for this purpose  are what is called sugaring, and the use of light.  To obtain moths by means of the former, a mixture of coarse oroiun  sugar and ale, with the addition of a little rum, should be made. The  mixture should have the consistence of treacle. The collector, with an  assistant, should take his mixture to the wood about sunset, or a little  before or after, and daub it on the trunks of the trees by means of a  brush, or saturate strios of cotton cloth with it and tack them to the  trunks. As soon as it gets dusk the sugared places should be revisited,  and the light from a bull's-eye lantern thrown on the sugared spots.  For several hours the moths will continue to arrive, sometimes in con-  siderable numbers, and may be taken with the net, which should, be  held beneath the sugared spot previously to turning on the light, as  many have the trick of falling; or captured, as they sit feeding on the  dainty bait, by means of a wide-mouthed bottle having ammonia or  chloroform od cotton or a sponge on the bottom. The noctuae are  principally obtained by this means, and one or two expeditions should  be made every week during the collecting season, viz: from early  spring until the latter part of autumn, avoiding localities where odor-  ous flowers are plentiful. The collector should not be discouraged if  troops of moths do not come at his first invitation, or even if he should  be compelled to return home rich in patience but very poor in specimens.  The fascination of the \" foolish moth\" by light has a time-honored  use, having served to adorn many a tale and point many a moral ; and  yet there is beneath the iact a hidden meaning or moral, perhaps,  unsuspected by either poet or moralist. It is sufficient for the collector  to know they are fire-worshippers, and to avail himself of this tendency  to secure their fleeting forms in their season. This may be done by  taking a lantern into the open country near a wood, and suspending  it over a white sheet spread on the ground, thus showing their forms  12   178 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  more distinctly, when tTiey may be captured with the net. But this  expedient is very far inferior to sugaring.  Many specimens can be taken with but little trouble by placing a  light within a room on the ground floor before a closed window, par-  ticularly one facing a garden or the open country. The moths will  flutter on the outside before the light, or alight on the panes of glass,  when they can be easily secured in pill boxes, killed and pinned as  they are caught. Moonlight nights are unfavorable to the use of light.  Those who live in towns lighted by gas will be able to secure many  specimens around the lamps; or by making friends with the lamplighter  and supplying him with pill boxes, he may furnish you every morning  with many S2)ecimens and sometimes rarities. In using the light for  making captures, care should be taken to guard against the moth  singeing its antennae or wings in the flame.  The males of the Bombyces chiefly may be taken by exposing the  virgin females with crumpled wings on trees, or enclosed in cages,  exposed in the open country.  I would earnestly recommend every collector to note the date of  capture of all his Lepidoptera on a little square of paper, and pass the  pin transfixing the insect through it. It is simply necessary to indi-  cate the month by its initial letter and to give the day in figures. By  following this plan, which will indicate approximately the earliest and  latest periods of their appearance, and the numbers of broods during the  season, he will be able to tell at any time when to look for the species  he may desire, and to form a calendar showing the periods of appear-  ance of species, and will enable one to make accurate comparisons in  this respect between widely separated geographical areas. Many  species of our lepidopterous insects are spread over immense areas,  and some of them appear to be common to the entire continent, and a  calendar of this kind, when once formed, would show the successive pul-  sations of lepidopterous life, (as it advances along the broad sun-track  from the genial regions of the Gulf to our northern boundaries, and  throbs over the great western plains to the Eocky mountains.)  HOW TO KILL LEPIDOPTERA.  Insects should be killed with at least some manifestation of humanity,  so as not to engender a spirit of cruelty in the minds of the young who  may witness the operation, and it should be accomplished, at the same  time, with poisons or agents that can be trusted in the hands of the  young and those inexperienced in their effects. A great variety of  agents have been recommended for this purpose, and it would be quite  unnecessary to allude to all of them.  Chlorofobm is exceedingly useful to the collector, in consequence of  the rapidity of its efl'ects. It is objectionable, however, inasmuch  if its influence is carried too far it causes rigid contraction of the  thoracic muscles, which throws the wings into positions that renders  setting them subsequently almost impossible. Moths should there-  fore merely be benumbed by it. A few seconds is sufiicient generally  to produce this effect, and the influence of the agent intermitted for  the purpose of pinning the insect. When this has been done, if it is   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTINQ INSECTS. * 179  of large size, its revival raay be prevented by using oxalic acid, as  will be presently explained ; or if a \" micro,\" the pin containing the  specimen should be fixed in a piece of cork and introduced into the  ammonia bottle. When using chloroform for benumbing the very  small moths, care must be taken that they do not fall or introduce  themselves into the drop used for this purpose ; for it ruins them  irretrievably ; therefore it should be spread by passing the glass which  contains the specimen over it; or, what is perhaps better, the top of the  collecting-box, (since it is in the field that this accident most frequently  occurs^ (should be covered with dark colored cloth glued to the surlace,  and this will absorb the liquid sufficiently to prevent its occurrence.  The collector should not, then, kill the smaller moths in the field with  this agent, but permit them to revive, and kill and set them after  returning home. It should never be applied to a varnished surface,  for it is a solvent of all varnishes.  I would recommend this agent, then, to be used as the means of  abolishing the power of voluntary motion in moths, thus giving the  collector plenty of time during which he may pin them without  struggles or efforts to escape on their part.  Oxalic acid is employed to kill large moths after they have been  pinned, and should be in the form of a strong ivater or alcoholic solu-  tion. In using it a steel pen, or a quill pointed like a pen, but without  the slit, should be dipped in the solution and passed into the side of  the thorax under the wings. The pen should be held there for a short  time and moved from side to side so that the whole of the solution  may enter the body. In killing large females it is best to make more  than one application. The objection to the acid is, that it leaves  a white spot, which is apt to spread and disfigure the specimen, but  this can generally with care be obviated. It is possibly scarcely  necessary to state that it is a violent poison when taken internally,  and that the bottle containing it should be the object of some care.  Ammonia is an excellent agent for killing Lepidoptera ; the strong  spirits of ammonia should be used. In order to make use of it a wide-  mouthed, moderately deep glass jar should be obtained, and the edges  of the mouth ground down accurately on a piece of sheet lead with  emery and water, so as to allow a piece of heavy plate glass to close  it air-tight. If the jar rises in the centre, the bottom may be filled  with cotton so as to obtain a level surface. When the jar is to be  used, a piece of sponge is wet with a few drops of the ammonia, (the  operator should have some care for his fingers and nose at the same  time.) and the insect introduced, either pinned to a piece of cork or  free as the operator pleases. They soon become motionless, whatever  be their size, but will revive if taken out at once ; a half an hour is  sufficient to prevent the revival of the largest moths, but they may  remain without injury 24 or even 48 hours, perfectly relaxed and fit  for setting any time during that period, in consequence of the moisture  within the jar. The small Lepidoptera, tortrices and tineae, taken  in pill boxes, may be killed by placing the lid aslant previously to  introducing the box into the jar. The smallest kinds, the leaf miners,  nepticula and lithocalletis, should be pinned and set out immediately  they are dead. Green moths have their color affected by ammonia.   180 â–  INSTRUCTIONS FOE COLLECTING INSECTS.  The carho7iate of ammonia is recommended as a substitute for the  spirits, in consequence of no vapor collecting in the bottles, and being  cheaper and safer in the hands of the young. The best way to use it  is first to reduce it to small pieces, (not powder,) and to enclose it in  a small bag made of any porous material, and place it with its con-  tents at the bottom of the bottle, covering it with a perforated card.  HOW TO PIN LEPIDOPTERA.  In the first place, the pin should be adapted as far as possible to the  size of the specimen. The pins in use amongst the German and French  entomologists are too long and slender, and are liable to bend in  thrusting them into the cork unless carefully used. In these respects  the English pin is much to be preferred ; that used for the \" micros\"  being only three quarters of an inch long. The common pin, about  I5 inch long, answers very well for the large moths, and the size  somewhat short of an inch will do for those of moderate size ; but for  the micros it is indispensable to have a supply of Nos. 10, 19, and 20  of the English make. They are manufactured by Messrs. Edleston &  Williams, Crown Court, Cheapside, London.  The pin should be thrust vertically through the body in the centre  of the thorax, or the part to which the wings are attached. After it  has fairly entered the thorax a piece of soft cork is used, by pushing  the point of the pin into it, to raise the specimen the requisite distance  up the pin. At least one half oi the pin should be exposed below, and  uniformity in this respect can be obtained by always using the same  thickness of cork for this purpose. When about to pin a specimen  it should be placed on a cloth-covered surface to prevent it slipping  about, and if, under the effect of chloroform, it has turned on its back,  be reversed with a pin ; or those of moderate or large size may be  taken by the thorax and feet with the thumb and finger of the left  hand and pinned whilst being thus held, and the position of the  specimen atterwards regulated by the cork. Specimens can be easily  transfixed on the top of the collecting box, if it is covered with cloth,  without the necessity of touching them with the fingers. Many of the  micro Lepidoptera_, however, turn upon their backs and project their  posterior legs ; if they cannot be easily reversed again with a pin,  they must be taken between the thumb and forefinger of the left  hand, by their projecting legs, and permitted to fall in the space formed  by the contact of these members, with the head to the left or front  according to the position of the hand. Then, by taking a small pia  between the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, and resting the  unoccupied fingers on those of the left, in order to insure steadiness,  the pin is easily pushed through the thorax of even the smallest  species. The success attending this operation depends on taking up  the specimen so that it will rest closely in the sulcus of the thumb  and forefinger, with the head well forward. Of course, previously to  taking it up, the head should be turned to the right. A few failures  in the first instance should not discourage the beginner.   INSTRUCTIONS FOE COLLECTING INSECTS. 181   nO\"W TO SET LEPIDOPTERA.  The wings of lepidoptera are usually set, that is, expanded as  though in the act of flying ; but it is well to have one or two speci-  mens showing the wings in their natm^al position during repose. The  collector should prepare, in the first place, a number of braces of  stiff card, varying in length from half an inch to two inches, cut so  as to taper towards one end, square at the other, and about the fourth  of an inch broad. Through the broad end of each, a large strong  pin should be introduced. A piece of board should then be covered  with sheet cork glued to the surface ; this forms what is called the  setting board. When a specimen is to be set, two of the braces are  fixed on the board at a sufficient distance. apart to receive the body  between them, and to sujiport the wings well after expansion. Then,  with a setting needle, a common needle thrust into a piece of wood so  that it can be used more conveniently, the wings are expanded on  the lower braces and fixed there by placing over them additional ones.  Another form of setting board is made by having grooves in it to  receive the body and then by applying braces to the expanded wings  they are easily retained i)erfectly flat. Some use pieces of plate glass  of difierent widths to press down the expanded wings, but it is not  the best plan, strips of paper pinned over the wings being preferable.  The wings should be expanded by introducing the setting needle  on their inner margin, or where they meet over the top of the body.  Insects should be left on the board from a day or two to four or five,  according to size and the condition of the weather. Care must be  taken to exclude mites from the board ; this can be done by using a  mixture of equal parts o{ oil of thyme, oil of anise, and spirits of loine.  It should be spread over the setting board, and especially laid on the  grooves, and for this purpose spirits of turpentine is also very effectual  and much cheaper than the mixture of essential oils.  REARING THE CATERPILLAR. â€” THE VIVARIUM.  The study of Lepidoptera does not consist in the collection of  perfect insects and the investigation of their peculiarities of structure.  They have all lived an active, voracious, and interesting life pre-  viously to transformation from the embryonic state to that of maturity,  and it is the aim of the naturalist, as well as of natural history, to  look kmdly into their individual existences, and seizing the particu-  lars of each little life by observation, to write their biographies.  The student must free his mind from the worship of the idols of size  and physical beauty, which incline him to regard with respect him  who devotes his powers to the study of mammals, whilst he smiles  pityingly on one who falls into ecstacies over a new found beetle.  Wherein is the superiority of the former pursuit ? Tlie same evidences  of thought are discernible here as there, adaptations more wonder-  ful, habits more interesting and more injurious to our interests, an  anatomy more complicated, physiological questions more difficult of  solution, and even life itself seems to laugh at regularity or harmony   182 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  among tlie insect world in its manifestations of strange, wonderful,  ridiculous forms, and their mode of ornamentation and clothing. But  here, as elsewhere in the animated world, we have expressed in vital  characters the thoughts and conceptions of a living God.  It is imperatively necessary to entomological science that the habits  and transformations of larvae should be studied and known, and their  forms and ornamentation well described. The study possesses these  advantages over most other departments of natural history, that it  can be pursued during leisure and unoccupied time, its inexpensive-  ness, and the abundance of the objects to be observed. In the trust that  many into whose hands these instructions will fall may become ob-  servers and students of Lepidoptera, and being conscious that to the  novice everything in this connexion is of value, the attempt will be  made to anticipate much that may embarrass him.  Those who delight to ramble in ibrests and green fields during  the genial days of spring and the cool mornings of summer for \" air  and exercise,\" little know how much pleasure and profit result from  such rambles when undertaken with some definite object in view.  Things which were before unmeaning or unquestioned become the  subjects of inquiry and information when that object is connected  with natural history, and every field and hill side, every shrub and  plant becomes the theatre of startling scenes of life and death, of  artifices and devices more incredible and wonderful than the most  fanciful creations of fairy lore. With observation thus kept con-  stantly on the alert, the student will have but little difficulty in finding  the objects he seeks ; but we will help him by pointing out such indi-  cations of the presence of larvae as may at first escape his attention.  The early morning is the most favorable time to seek for the cater-  pillar, which seems to prefer its food moistened with dew, although  they may be found during any other portion of the day. When they  cannot be at once seen, their presence is indicated by finding their  ' 'frass' ' or ejectamenta beneath the plants on whicli they feed ; by partly  eaten leaves, or leaves contorted and rolled into cylinders and cornets  and secured by bands of silk, or superimposed and bound together in  the same manner; by the existence of a hole surrounded with \"frass\"  in the pithy stalks of various plants, or in subcortical mines near the  roots of various trees and shrubs ; in the stems and leaves of various  grasses, or living in portable cases on the leaves of plants, or within  houses, feeding on various articles of food and apparel ; or by the  existence of discolored patches on the surface of the leaves of various  plants and forest trees, the oaks, the linden, the beech, the iron wood,  the elms, the hickories, the sycamore, &c , caused by minute leaf  mining caterpillars freeing the epidermis in the process of feeding on  the parenchyma, or feeding on grains and the seed heads of composite  plants, on lichens and fungi. Besides the lepidopterous leal miners  there are coleopterous and dipterous miners, whicli are rather difficult  to distinguish from the former; in general, however, the dipterous  larvae are more maggot-like in appearance, and the coleopterous leaf  miners, in many instances, stain the whole surface of their mines  with their \"frass,\" which appears to have been dissolved, whilst  that of the lepidopterous larvae is in little pellets. There is, how-   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 183  ever, no certain mode of distinguishing but by experience, for the  oldest collectors are sometimes deceived. Many caterpillars hyber-  nate during winter, and may be found concealed under stones, &c.  â– when the cold weather of autumn approaches, or are dug up at the  roots of trees during search for pupa3. They should never be kept in  a warmed room, but exposed as soon as taken to the temperature of  the external atmosphere. And lastly, we must not forget to mention  that a number of species inhabit the water plants, growing in quiet  X)ools and on the margins of little lakes.  With regard to the means of collecting specimens, the student  should supply himself with a number of pill-boxes of various sizes, in  which to carry his captures when found, remembering that some of  them are carnivorous, and will make a meal of their companions  when forced into intimate association. He must note particularly the  plant on which the larva has been found, and put a portion of it in  the box, and remember that in general tliey will eat of nothing but  the species of 'plant on which they loere found. Hence it is almost im-  possible to rear a larva which has been met with under conditions  that give us no information respecting its natural food plant, unless  by trying it with a variety we at last accidentally find one it will eat.  He should carry an umbrella, and by beating bushes and the  branches of trees into it with a cane or rod, it will receive the dis-  lodged larvae, and save him the trouble of search. Or several yards  of white cotton sheeting may be spread beneath a tree, and the upper  branches above it beaten with a pole, when we have reason to suspect  the presence of larvae. An ardent collector, living in a little village  in this vicinity, carries with him during his excursions a stout rope  and hatchet. If, in examining the ground beneath forest trees, he  finds fresh \" frass\" from the larger caterpillars, he scans the branches  until lie detects the eaten leaves, and then, casting his rope over a  stout limb by means of a stone^ he ascends the tree rapidly, severs  with his hatchet the branch on which he supposes the larvae to be,  and, descending, secures his well-earned prize. In this manner he  has irequently collected on the hickory during one day twenty larvae  of the rare and heaMiUxAlDnjocampa imperialis.  When leaves are unrolled to ascertain if a larva is present, it should  always be done over a spread handkerchief^ as otherwise the disturbed  inhabitant may make its escape by falling to the ground. All falling  larvae, however, attach their thread previously to deserting their food  plant, and can usually be found, if they have reached the ground, by  passing the hand beneath the place where it was, when it will come  in contact with the thread, and this will serve as a guide to find it  again. The mines of leaf miners should not be opened to ascertain  whether they contain an inhabitant ; this information can be obtained  by holding the leaf between the light and the eye.  The collector will sometimes find the egg of some species of ichneu-  mon attached to the skin of the larvae. We do not mean the cocoon  of the larva of a small ichneumon, so frequently mistaken for eggs by  the uninitiated, but veritable eggs, which, if permitted to remain, pro-  duce larvae that will destroy the pupa. This is very easily prevented  by crushing the eggs with a pair of fine-pointed pincers, being careful   184 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  not to include the epidermis of the larva. He must learn early to  distinguish the larvae of saio-jiies from the true caterpiUar. These  false caterpillars have globular heads and cylindrical, naked bodies,  sometimes covered with a white flaky substance that easily rubs off,  or have a dark-colored, slimy skin, and are either entirely deprived of  abdominal legs, or have from eighteen to tiventy-tivo, and are unarmed  with hooks. The true caterpillar never has more than ten ahdominal  legs, which are always armed with minute hooks.  Every caterpillar undergoes periodical moultings, and they must on  no account be disturbed whilst undergoing this change. When one  of these periods arrive they cease to eat, and appear to be sick and  languishing, remaining steadfastly fixed on some portion of their  food plant, with the hooks of their false legs fastened in a little web  of silk, and, even though irritated, are unwilling to change their po-  sition. It is always a critical time in the life of the larva, during  which it not only changes its skin, but appears in one or two new  dresses before reaching that characteristic of its maturity. The stu-  dent should, therefore, learn early to recognize it, and to respect the  necessities of the little creature of which he has made a captive. When  larvae are dissatisfied with their food plant or about to change to pupae,  they never indicate it in this manner, but traverse their place of con-  finement incessantly and restlessly, travelling over the same track  until they wear it into a pathway.  The chief indications to be observed in rearing larvae is to place  them in as nearly a natural condition as possible, and to keep their  food plant fresh for the longest practicable period. In order to fulfil  these conditions in all cases, something must be left to individual in-  genuity and intelligence, but for the great majority of larvae I would  heartily recommend the following elegant and easily constructed  vivarium :  It consists of a circular wooden box, from six to twelve inches in  diameter or more, at the option of the observer, and from four to six  inches deep, lined with sheet zinc or lead, so as to be water-tight. A  stratum about an inch or two inches thick of washed, fine gravel-  stones is placed on the bottom, and the remaining space is filled with  moisiened but not wet loam, and the surface covered with moss. Into  this various small, humble plants may be set for the purpose of gen-  erating oxygen, and consuming the carbonic acid gas exhaled by the  larvae, and the whole is covered with a bell glass, that rests upon the  rim, proportioned in height to the diameter of the box. When it is  to be used, a portion of the food plant of the larva should be stuck  into the moistened loam, where it will remain fresh quite a long  time, in consequence of the atmosphere within the bell glass being  saturated with watery vapor, which condenses on the sides, and  trickles down to the soil again.  The arrangement of the earthy materials closely resembles that of  natural soil, and if the transformation of the larva is subterranean,  there is no necessity to remove it in order that it may undergo the  change to a jjupa. If the larva is a large one, or if it contains more  than one, the bell glass should be elevated every few days, and their  ejcctamenta removed from the surface.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 185  The glass merely stands on the rim of the box, and should not be  perfectly air tight; and the vivarium should be exposed to the change  of temperature between night and day, so that the included atmo-  sphere, by its expansions and contractions, may be also renewed from  the external air. It should never, however, be exposed to the direct  rays of the sun, but always kept in the shade.  To those who may regard this apparatus too expensive, another  form is recommended, but it is neither as convenient nor successful,  except in the case of leaf miners and micro-lepidoptera. The top of  a glass jar, at least five or six inches in diameter, is ground down on  a piece of sheet lead with emery and water, so as to be perfectly level,  and to receive accurately a piece of plate glass as a covering, in order  to prevent the escape of moisture. The bottom of this is covered with  moistened sand, a little loam, and the surface with moss. Into this  the food, plant, and caterpillar may be introduced, with the expecta-  tion that the insect will do very well. It is, however^ apt to become  foul from the accumulated \"frass,\" and is inconvenient to clean.  In order to rear leaf-mining larvae that never leave the leaf in  which they are found, or at least not until about to transform, a com-  mon large drinking glass, the top of which has been ground level  and covered with a piece of plate glass, answers a very good purpose.  The bottom should be covered with ichite sand, moistened, but no  water should be permitted to rest on the surface. It is not necessary,  of course, to place in this apparatus anything more than the leaf,  with a portion of its stem containing the leaf miner. The collector  should provide himself with a tin canister in which to carry the leaves  containing leaf miners during his entomological excursions.  A still cheaper and very effectual breeding cage consists of a frame  of any convenient size, say twelve inches square, covered with bob-  binet, and with a door in front. The bottom must be of wood, and  the plant may be kept fresh for several days by inserting it in a vial  half filled with water.  We have now to touch on what devolves upon the observer, in  making use of these contrivances, to enable him to record the habits  of larvae, and to make good and useful descriptions. In the history  of the life of any being one of the most valuable traits of the observer  is truthfulness, not that we mean to say any one would wilfully mis-  represent what he sees, but that he should be truthful in recording  what he sees and knows to be facts, not what he may imagine or con-  jecture; and however strange it may appear to those not familiar with  these studies, the temptation or inducement to depart from what is  evidently so proper is often strong and of frequent occurrence. Some-  times it is the consequence of hastiness or of inattention, or it is an  apparently plain and obvious deduction; but the ways of nature some-  times surpass in strangeness the ways of our reasoning. All this  involves the idea of accuracy in the description of natural objects, and  it is far from easy to give a clear and graphic conception of larvae by  attempting lo represent its physical characteristics in words. The  observer should not be content merely to describe the ornamentation  of larvae, but should endeavor to give, in a clear and concise loord  â€¢picture, a definite conception of its form, clothing, and external pecu-   186 INSTEUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  Uarities ; and if he can sketcli and color natural objects with facility  and accuracy, a collection of drawings representing the larvae, food-  plant, and pupa would be very valuable and interesting.  There are certain terms employed by entomologists which will be of  use to the observer, and which we will endeavor to explain.  Any particular family will always be found to show a variety of  larval forms, which, whilst they conform to a certain type, indicate  by their modifications the relationships existing in every direction  between it and other families. Hence, whilst there is no standard or  invariable larval form for any family, it may be well, by the employ-  ment of general terms, to give the novice some conception of the  affinities^, at least, of those which will most probably first attract his  attention.  1. Sphingi/orm would, therefore, characterize larvae having naked  bodies and a horn or shining lenticular tubercle on the eleventh ring,  and broad, strong anal prolegs.  2. Notodontiform larvae generally have the body furnished with  fleshy elevations, and usually hold the hind segments elevated.  3. Ghelonidiform larvae have the body covered by long ttiick hair,  arranged in verticillate bunches or whorls, arising from verrucose  points or warty excrescences.  4. Geometriform larvae are characterized by the absence of some of  the abdominal prolegs, or the want of development in some of them.  5. Catocaliform larvae have the head rather small, flattened, and  carry it horizontally ; the body is semi-cylindrical, tapering anteriorly  and posteriorly from the middle ; a small transverse, fleshy ridge or  prominence on the eleventh segment ; the anal prolegs rather long  and thrown backwards, generally the first two pairs of abdominal  prolegs not well developed, and the rings of ventral surface marked  with round spots ; they arch the body in motion, particularly when  young.  6. Phaleniform larvae consist of the geometers, properly so called,  or measuring loorms ; they are characterized by the absence of the first  three pairs of abdominal prolegs quite constantly, leaving but one  pair of abdominal and one pair of anal prolegs, in all ten feet ; the  true or thoracic feet are placed on mammillons, which increase in size  to the third pair ; the body is generally cylindrical, and the middle  segments longer than either those of the anterior or posterior portions ;  the eleventh segment is marked on the dorsum by a transverse ridge  or small excrescences^ and frequently the fourth, fifth, and eighth  have fleshy excrescences or appendages.  7. Uranidiform larvae will be found possibly in southern Texas or  in Florida ; their forms are not well known: They are described as  being either semi-geometrical â€” that is, having some of the prolegs  absent or atrophied, arching their bodies when in motion, swollen in  the middle, having two retractile tentacles on the head,(?) and living  on the terebinthaceae ; or they have sixteen feet complete, are thick,  with deep incisions between the rings, a large head joined to the body  without any intermediate constriction, the flrst segment liaving a  corneous and shining shield, and the body furnished with quite lopg  isolated hairs ; they hide during day under a transparent web of silk   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS 187  spun amongst the leaves. Botli forms are of large size, and are  tropical insects.  8. Liparidiform larvae are simply hairy, and generally with brushes  and long tufts of hair in addition.  9. Saturnidiform larvae have thick, heavy bodies, deeply incised,  and furnished usually with rows of blunt or slender acute rigid spines,  and large, strong anal prolegs.  10. Ceratocampiform larvae are also furnished with rows of rough-  ened acute tubercles, but have long rigid horns on the anterior rings.  11. CocJdiopodiform or onisci/orm larvae are very sliort and small,  either semi-cylindrical or oval, having no visible head, being retrac-  tile, nor visible feet or prolegs. The whole surface of the abdomen is  applied to the object to which they adhere. We have many most re-  markable forms of this family.  12. GastroiKichiform larvae are nearly naked, semi-cylindrical,  very much flattened beneath, loith Jiesliy protuberances or tiiffs of hair  above the legs. They are generally found flatly applied to trees, the  bark of which they resemble.  13. Psychidiform larvae, or basket-carriers, inhabit silken cases,  and attach pieces of leaves, sticks, &c., to the outside.  14. Tortriciform larvae and tineiform larvae, except among the leaf  miners, differ but little in form. They are generally of small size,  smooth, semi-cylindrical, tapering anteriorly and posteriorly, with a  semi-elliptical horizontal head. The former usually roll and bind  leaves together, and the latter live in cases made of portions of leaves,  &c., or in seeds, fungi, on rotten wood and decaying vegetable sub-  stances_, or in the interior of leaves between their cuticles.  There are a few very convenient terms which should be used in  describing the ornamentation of larvae.  The dorsal line is a colored longitudinal line on the middle of the  back of the larvae, and follows the course of the dorsal vessel.  The sub-dorsal line is also longitudinal, and placed nearly or quite  at an equal distance from the dorsal and the following :  The stigmatal, which is placed on the sides a little above the feet,  and about the height of the stigmatal or breathing holes.  The papiliform p)oints are dots on the body of larvae, nearly plain,  and scarcely elevated above the surface, each giving rise to a hair.  When they are rougher and more salient, and give rise to one or more  visible hairs, they are called â€”  The verrucose points, and, as well as the above, are usually disposed  on the dorsum in a more or less restricted trapezoid, or in squares.  The dorsal region is that portion included between the sub- dorsal  lines. ,  The lateral region is that between the sub- dorsal and stigmatal lines.  The ventral region, all the portion below the stigmatal lines.  The cervical shield is a corneous plate on the dorsum of the first ring.  Shagreened or granulated, when the skin of larvae is roughened by  minute raised grains, but at the same time naked.  Naked or smooth, when the cuticle is without appendages or covering  of hairs.  Scabrous, when any portion is roughly and acutely shagreened.   188 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  Tubercles are hardened elevations,, spined, scabrous, plain, cylin-  drical, or lenticular.  Spines are rigid, slender, and acute, and resemble small thorns.  Com'pound spines, a stalk furnished with numerous simple spines.  Haii^s are fine dermal appendages like the ordinary hair ; they are  arranged in tufts, pencils, or are verticillate.  Horns are projections from the surface either corneous or fleshy, and  are simple, spined, rigid, roughened, flexible, fiesliy , or penniform.  Velvety, when the surface is clothed with soft short hair.  Hairy, when covered with hair either in tufts or verticillate bunches.  llammillated, when short fleshy projections exist ; they are simple,  spined, or hairy; also called pjapillae.  Attenuated, when the body diminishes in breadth anteriorly or pos-  teriorly.  Moyiiliform, when the rings are separated by deep incisions and re-  semble a succession of globular bodies like beads.  Cylindrical and sub-cylindrical, when the body has these geometrical  forms.  Elongated, when the body is slender and appears to have been drawn  out.  Bristles resemble hairs, but are stiff\" and rather rigid.  The direction in which the longitudinal diameter of the head stands  to the axis of the body is â€”  Horizontal, when they form one plane.  Nutant, when its long diameter forms an obtuse angle with the  body.  Perpendicular, when a right angle is formed with the axis of the  body.  Kespecting its connexion with the body, it is â€”  Free, when distinctly visible and not covered by the first ring.  Inserted or retracted, when the occiput, or top, is partly concealed.  Concealed, when entirely withdrawn within the first ring, or is  covered by it.  Betractile, when a concealed head can be thrust out.  Elevated, when the top of the vertex is above the level of the dor-  sum or back.  Bifid, when the vertex is divided into two distinct lobes.  The object in following larvae through their embryonic develop-  ment is to obtain a full and comj)lete history of the species. A good  description, therefore, should correspond to the particulars detailed  below, arranged, in the first place, at the option of the observer, but,  when completed for each species, should begin with a description of  the egg, and follow the Jiistory to the development of the perfect  insect,  1Â°. The date lohen the larvae was found, and under luhat conditions.  2Â°. The name of its food plant, botanical and common.  3Â°. A description of its physical pecidiarities ; commencing with the  head, its size as compared to the body, form, position, and relations  to the body ; then the general form of the body, whether it varies  from the cylindrical, and how, whether attenuated anteriorly or pos-  teriorly, or swollen or prominent in any portion or deeply incised, and   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 189  the relation of the segments to each other ; all protuheranccs should  be designated, and the nature of the dermal appendages, if any,  noticed ; the number of feet, abdominal and anal prolegs, and the  position of the latter with reference to the plane of the body, on what  rings they are absent or are weakly developed, or are modified.  To indicate the number and situation of the legs and prolegs, I use  the following formula, which is not intended to supplant description:  Every larvae having thirteen segments, including the head, the dots  indicate segments without feet thus : ( â€¢ f â€¢ â€¢ i â€¢ â€¢ i)- The formula rep-  resents the most common form, that having sixteen legs.  4Â°. Its peculiarities of coloring ; giving first the general color of  both head and body, and then the ornamentation on each.  5Â°. Tlie date at ichich it began to prepare for pupation, and the nature  of its preparations.  6Â°. A descrijition of the p)upa itself. It is not advisable, usually, to  make a description of this from the first or a single specimen.  7Â°. The date at lohich it became a perfect insect, and method of its  escap)efrom the cocoon, if it has one.  8Â°. The number of broods of the perfect insect during one season, and  whether the period of larval developmen\\fc is annual or bi-annual.  The observer should also endeavor to ascertain and describe â€”  9Â°. The egg of the 'perfect insect, its form, color, and peculiar mark-  ings under a lens. When the perfect insect of a larvae is once  known, this and the following can be ascertained by preserving the  egg layer.  10Â°. The appearance of the young larva on first emerging from the  egg ; the successive changes in appearance it undergoes during its  moultings until it reaches the condition indicative of maturity.  11Â°. The habits of the larva, including everything pertaining to  larval life, from the time of leaving the egg to maturity, whether  characteristic or not.  12Â°. The habits of the perfect insect, as far as they can be ascertained.  The student should begin, in the first instance, with the endeavor  to refer his caterpillar to one of the larval forms characterized here-  tofore, in order to gather his descriptions under general heads. Prob-  ably he will not be successful in referring it to any there indicated,  for several groups have been omitted in consequence of the difficulty  of representing them by any graphic characters. These he may  arrange under any general heading that appears most appropriate to  himself. Each vessel containing a larva should be marked with a  special numeral, beginning with one for the first, and so on, and the  description should be indicated by the same number ; if the pupa is  removed from the vivarium in order to receive another larva, (for two  dissimihir larvae should never be placed in the same vessel at one  time^) that containing the pupa should be designated by the number  referring to the description of tlie larva, and the numeral should be  marked on a little square of paper and fixed on the pin containing  the perfect insect when it appears and has been killed and pinned.  A specimen of the mature larva described, whenever it can be ob-  tained, should be drowned in alcohol and enclosed in a piece of foil,  such as is now commonly used for wrapping fine-cut tobacco, with   190 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  the number referring to its description, in j^encil, on a slip of paper.  Thus prepared, it should be dropped into a bottle of alcohol, together  with the cocoon and pupa, or pupa alone, if it has no cocoon, treated  in a similar manner, and marked with same number. When the  student desires to forward his collection to the Smithsonian Institu-  tion, the bottles containing the larvae and pupae should have the tops  filled with cotton, then completely filled with liquid to prevent the  agitation of its contents, and tiglitly corked. TJie name and locality  of the collector should be written on the top, as also on the box con-  taining perfect insects, and on the copy of his notes. When it is  possible to obtain them, at least from three to six specimens of the  same species of perfect insects are desirable.  I would recommend those who are desirous of becoming better  acquainted with the subject of entomology, and of acquiring some  insight into the classification of Lepidoptera_, to obtain The Introduc-  tion to Entomology, by Kirby and Spence, republished by Lea & Blan-  chard, Philadelphia, in addition to \"A Treatise on some of the  Insects of New England which are Injurious to Vegetation. By  Thaddeus William Harris, M. D. Boston : Printed by White &  Potter.\" There is also another work published by the State of New  York in its natural history series, the chief merit of which, at least  with respect to Lepidoptera, consists in its rather indifferent plates.  It is much more expensive than Dr. Harris' treatise, and by no means  as reliable^, but may enable the student to ascertain the names of some  species by comparing the perfect insects with the plates. Besides  these works there is also a Catalogue of the North American Sphinges,  by Dr. Harris, in the 3Gth volume of Silliman's Journal of Science  and Art, 1839; and the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia  will soon publish a synopsis of the same family, representing the  present state of its classification, and describing all the new species  which have been discovered up to the present time. This can be  obtained by students and observers, upon application, for the cost of  paper and press-work, which will be comparatively nominal. This  paper will be followed by synopses of other families as rapidly as they  can be worked up, one of the most serious difficulties being that of  obtaining specimens of all the perfect insects described by foreign  naturalists. If, therefore, those who intend to collect for the Institu-  tion would commence during the present season, and forward to  Washington a box of perfect insects from their respective localities,  it will facilitate the labors of those engaged at present in the study  and hasten the development of this portion of entomological science  in the United States. Any observations the student may desire to  make public should be transmitted to the Academy of Natural  Sciences in Philadelphia for publication in their \"â–  Proceedings.\"  THE PUPAE.  The larvae that issue from the egg of the perfect insect in early  spring reach their full development about its latter portion, and en-  tering the pupa state, appear as perfect insects usually in about two or  three iveeJcs. The representatives of these, generally speaking, do not  become pupae until the beginning of the fall and re.uain in this con-   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 191  dition throngliout the winter, emerging as imago during the succeeding  spring. The observer should therefore begin his search for young  larvae and eggs with the first appearance of vegetation, and either  make them captives or mark the places where they may be found ; but  in general the former is preferable. Feeding and rearing larvae in  spring time has also this advantage : that the food-plant is kept fresh  longer and with less difficulty than in the latter part of summer and  the autumn, and specimens of the perfect insects are obtained the same  season.  After the insect has changed to the pupa it should not be unneces-  sarily disturbed, and never handled with the fingers, except when it  cannot be avoided, and then the utmost gentleness of pressure should  be used. This applies more particular]}'- to pupa which have been  developed in the atmosphere of the vivarium, where its humidity pre-  vents the hardening of the pupa case as completely and rapidly as it  takes place in the external air. When it is removed from the viva-  rium it should be placed as nearly as possible in the same condition  that the larva chose for it, and the new vessel containing it should be  designated by the number of its caterpillar, so that the perfect insect  may be referred properly to its larva. The observer need not be soli-  citous about the apparent impossibility of the perfect insect making its  escape from very dense cocoons, and attempt to aid them by opening  them ; nature has provided a very efficient and powerful means to  effect what is at first view, and what naturalists themselves have re-  garded, a most curious puzzle. Without entering into particulars, I  may say here that the effective and only agent by which this is ac-  complished is the action of the powerful thoracic m'dscles. The larvae  of the fall months should not be disturbed after entering the ground,  for many of them hyhernoie until spring in their cells or cocoons made  on the surface when they change to pupae.  The pupae of cochliopodiform or onisciform larvae are always enclosed  in a small ovoid, brittle, silky cocoon, and are difficult to bring to  maturity. The larvae hybernate in them until the following spring,  when they change into pupae covered by a very thin and delicate pupae  case. Their cocoons should be permitted to remain amongst the moss  where they are usually woven, and the moss should be kept moist and  exposed to the external air beneath some convenient and protecting  shelter, and covered with a layer of fine, dried grass during winter.  I have found a great number of very remarkable forms belonging to  this family, but as it was during the period of my own inexperience  in rearing larvae, and being unable to obtain hints from others or from  books, for there are none 1 believe in which the subject is treated, I  lost the greater portion of them and have since looked vainly for other  specimens.  The vessel containing pupae should always be provided with ob-  jects, such as portions of the branch of a tree, fixed in the ground, in  order that the imago when it appears may ascend one of them and  expand its wings. For when they first appear their wings are unde-  veloped, flaccid and moist; they immediately ascend tlie first encoun-  tered object that is perpendicular or nearly so, and seek to place them-  selves in such a position that their wings may be depenclent or hang  downivards from the bach. Then they begin to grow and develop   192 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  themselves in every direction, and spots which were previously very  small in consequence of the overlapping of the scales, when the pro-  cess is completed, have twice or thrice the original dimensions. The  process of wing expansion should not be permitted to take place in  the moist atmosphere of the vivarium, except in the '' micros,\" nor  should the insect be disturbed or killed until after it begins to use its  wings voluntarily ; otherwise it will be difficult to make good prepa-  rations of the wings. These bred insects on first being handled or  when they first feel the efi'ect of chloroform, void a quantity of excre-  mentitious matter, which the student must be careful does not soil the  wings.  The practice of the old trans- Atlantic collectors of obtaining pupae by  digging for them at the roots of trees has been recently revived in Eng-  land with the most successful results by the Rev. Joseph Greene. He  says that \" meadows and parks, with scattered timber trees, are gene-  rally the best localities ; next to meadows and parks come woods ; but  searching in woods is a tedious and fatiguing affair, and requires some  experience ; it is in vain to examine the dense portions, it is equally  vain to dig at the roots of trees in such localities, and you will rarely  find anything unless upon trees of considerable growth ; the thick  moss which collects about the trunks and roots is the part to be  examined. Bombyces are generally found under the moss which  covers spreading roots and not on the trunks, which seem to be pre-  ferred by the Geometrae. The best localities in woods are the borders  or open places; such places when elevated or facing the north are  generally the most productive. The only instrument I use is a com-  mon garden trowel ; the form is immaterial, perhaps a rounded blade  is best, as passing with greater ease between the roots. The trees  which I have found the most productive are the following : elm,  oak, ash, poplar, beech, willow, and alder. [I would likewise add,  for the American collector, the walnut;^ the wild cherry^ the apple  tree, the linden, and the hickory.] In digging, it must be borne in  mind that all pupae are close to the trunk ot the tree, seldom more  than two inches distant ; frequently the trunk of the tree forms one  side of the cocoon, especially the cocoon of such insects as spin ; the  chrysalis also lies almost invariably close to the surface of the earth.  Insert the trowel about three inches from the trunk, to the depth of  two inches or so ; then push it to the tree and turn up ; if the soil be  dry and friable, without grass, knock it gently with the trowel, which  will be suflicient. If, however, there be grass, you must proceed more  cautiously ; take up the sod on the left hand, knock it very gently  with the trowel, and those pupte which merely enter the ground will  drop out ; to find those which spin, you must carefully examine the  sod, tearing the roots of the grass asunder ; these are, of course, much  the most difficult to find, the cocoons being generally of the color of the  earth. It is useless to try sticky or clayey grounds, the caterpillars being  unable to penetrate it ; in searching under moss the best plan is to  loosen the edge, then to tear it gently ofi\", observing whether any  pupae fall. Look at the trunk of the tree to see if anything adheres  to it, and then carefully examine the moss itself; experience alone  will enable you to detect a spun cocoon.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 193  In another place Mr. Green remarks : \" With rc^SLvd to localities,  the hest are unqiiestionably parks and meadows with scattered timber  trees. Those trees from which the surrounding grass has been worn  away by the feet of cattle, and those situated on the borders or banks  of streams, dykes, &c., when the soil is dry and friable, will be found  the most remunerative. When the roots of trees, particularly large  ones standing alone, form angles, pup;e will nearly always be found  in the spaces ; the trowel should then be inserted at least eight inches  from the trunk and to the depth of about four. In digging round a  tree, whose roots form no angles, it is not necessary to go deeper than  three inches, nor farther from the trunk than four. Always replace  the sod when you have done with it, or at least the debris. When  first taken up, the sod may be so hard as to render it impossible for  the caterpillar to penetrate it ; but if, after beiag loosened by the  pupa3-digger's manipulation, it be restored to its place, the larva,  which, in the original instance, would have wandered away to some  more convenient spot, will now find one ready made, and will almost  certainly make use of it.\"  \" He should have a small box, filled with damp moss, for the purpose  of carrying the pup?o, which should be handled as seldom as possible,  and with the utmost tenderness. I may here remark, that some of  the pupa3 may dry up. This is caused by some unlucky, probably  unseen, injury, inflicted at the time of capture, and, however great his  caution, will not unfrequently occur.\" The best months for digging  are July and August for the summer and autumn specimens, and  September, October, and November, for the following spring and sum-  mer insects. Mr. Green has found the months of September and  October the most remunerative to the pupa3 hunter.  In order to rear the pupas thus collected, \" when brought home they  should be placed in a large box, with the inside surface rough, and  covered with gauze or wire frame ; at the bottom of the box should be  some fine earth on which the pupfe are to be placed and covered with  a thick layer of moss, which may or may not be occasionally damped.  JBe sure to keep them from the sun.\" It is best also to keep them  exposed to the external air during winter. The one obvious principle  to be observed, as far as possible, is always to place them under the  natural conditions in which they were first found. The student may  also derive from pupa3 hunting valuable hints, at least respecting the  food plants of many larvre, and the periods of the season during which  they may be found near maturity.  now TO PACE LEPIDOPTERA FOR EXCHANGE, ETC.  In order to send insects to a distance safely, a box well made, of  light, thin material, should be obtained. It should be double, the  two portions attached together by hinges, and the bottoms lined with  cork, glued down, and covered with unsized paper; it should be about  twelve inches square, and each portion an inch and one-half deep,  before the cork lining is added ; but if the collector uses pins longer  than an inch and a fourth it should be deeper. The pins containing  specimens should be introduced firmly in the cork, and enough of the  13   194 INSTEUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  pin sliould always be exposed to permit it to take a good hold; and if  the abdomen be large and heavy it should be supported by cross pins :  that is, two or more fixed crosswise over this portion of the body, with  a pellet of cotton fixed on the pin beneath and drawn under the abdo-  men, so that it will rest on it. If the specimens are placed very high  on the pins, and raised considerably above the surface, the pin should  be first passed through a little cotton, and the specimen permitted to  rest on it, or the whole surface may be covered first with a layer of  cotton. A large number of specimens may be secured in the box by  pinning one over half the other, like shingles on a roof.  When the box is filled with specimens, the front should be secured  by a little hook and socket ; and it should be then wrapped in several  thicknesses of cotton wool, and the whole enclosed in a piece of cotton  sheeting made secure with a needle and thread. The object of wrapping  the box well in cotton is to prevent the specimens being broken or  injured by any jar or concussion the box may receive during transmis-  sion from one place to another. Bottles containing specimens of larvae,  &c., in alcohol^ should be enveloped in cotton and enclosed in a  paper box.  It may happen, sometimes, that those who desire to collect may be  in such a position that none of the expedients heretofore mentioned  may be available. Expeditions to the new countries of the west, or  persons stationed at military outposts and forts in the Indian territo-  ries, may be unable to obtain pins, or the agents heretofore mentioned  as being used for destroying the life of Lepidoptera, and will be, of  course, unable to make preparations in the ordinary manner. As  specimens from the Territories would be exceedingly interesting, in  order to anticipate the condition of those at military outposts and sta-  tions who would be willing to advance the cause of natural history by  collecting, I will suggest how it can be accomplished without any of  the conveniences heretofore mentioned.  If the spirits of ammonia cannot be obtained, insects may be killed  by the fumes of one or two sulphur matches, afier having been con-  fined under a glass, or by means of tobacco smoke, or by pinching the  thorax, as heretofore described. The wings should be then turned  upward, so as to be perpendicular to the back or erect, together with  the antennae or feelers situated on the head, and placed in this posi-  tion between a few folds of porous paper, and submitted to light pressure  until they have become partially dried, and the wings will retain their  position. They should then be placed on a square piece of paper,  which should be folded in a triangular form, and the open ends of the  sides turned over, so as to admit of as little motion to the included  specimen as possible. These papers, properly marked as to localities,  may afterwards be packed between layers of cotton in paper boxes, or  in any manner most convenient to the collector, provided they are not  submitted to pressure.  We can imagine no more pleasant and healthful employment during  lei'sure and unoccupied hours for the men who are stationed at the  military outposts of the Indian territories than collecting these objects  of natural history; and we would respectfully call the attention of  their ofiicers, many of whom have shown so much intelligence and   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 195  manifested so raucli interest in the collection of specimens belonging  to other classes, to the advantages which may result from it both to  those under their care and to entomology itself. If we remember  aright, the British government authorized such collections to be made  some years since in the neighborhood of the military stations in  Canada, with the most gratifying results, both to those engaged in  collecting and to this branch of natural history.  CABINETS, IMrLEMENTS, ETC.  The ring net is made of bobbinet of fine mesh, or, what is much  better, book muslin, and should be cut in three pieces, the sides of  which are rounded from the base to the apex, so that when sewed  together the net will have the form of a sugar loaf. It should be  rounded at the apex, and the circumference of the base, previous to  being fixed on the ring, should be somewhat more than the ring itself.  This may be moderately thick iron or brass wire, and should be from  eight to twelve inches in diameter. The depth of the net should be  at least once and a half that of the diameter of the ring, so that the  bottom may be thrown over the top of the ring by a twist of the rod.  This is frequently necessary, when a large and active moth has been  taken. An iron socket, with a male screw on the end, may be made  to receive the bent ends of the ring; or these may be fixed in a piece of  tubing by means of melted lead, one end being left open to receive the  rod ; or the bent ends of the wire may be fixed directly to the end of  the rod itself. The rod should not be more than three or four feet  long.  Any substitutes for cork will answer only for cabinet use ; there is  nothing that will supply its place in the exchange box. The follow-  ing substitutes have been recommended on account of their cheapness:  ''Inodorous felt\" is cut to fit the bottom of the boxes and glued to  the surface, and then covered with paper, or thick ironing blanket is  used for the same purpose. \"Cut the blanket the size of the drawer  or box and glue it down with good fresh glue; when perfectly dry^  soak it well with fresh paste, and paste one side of the paper also,  place the paper on the blanket, and smooth it well down with a warm  linen cloth. In four days it will, in a favorable situation, be fit to  hold insects.\" The sheet cork may be cut into strips, if one wishes to  economize, and glued in drawers or boxes, at a sufi^icient distance from  each other to admit of the specimens being arranged in rows.  The preservation of specimens after a collection has been once made  is by no means simple or easy; they should not be exposed to the light  of day, because many species in the course of time are deprived by  the light of their brilliancy of color, and become faded ; and hence  being kept in darkness, and the objects generally of merely occasional  inspection, they are apt to be destroyed by various insects that live on  dried animal substances, such as mites, the larvae of a species of coleop-  terous insect, an Anthrcenus, and the larva of a species of Tinea, which  makes its case of the scales and portions of the moths. When the  two latter have been permitted through neglect to accumulate in a col-  lection, the only certain mode of putting an end to their ravages, and   196 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  at the same time to destroy the iinhatched eggs, is to submit them to  a degree of heat sufficient to coagulate albumen. This is accomplished  by placing the box in an oven, turning the open portion downward,  and elevating it a little above the surface by means of supports so  that they may not be burned, and the insects themselves must be  watched lest they are scorched by the heat. The heat will soon dis-  lodge the larvae, which falling on the heated surface are killed, and  the albumen of the eggs is coagulated; thus preventing the develop-  ment of those in ova. I am acquainted with no means of preventing  the invasions of the anthreni, except perfect seclusion of the objects  themselves ; it is usual to recommend the introduction of lumps of  camphor into drawers and boxes, but it has very little effect on them;  tlie English entomologists use a few drops of Borneate of PetroUne,  (probably a mixture of oil of camphor and petroleum,) but as I have  never seen it nor used it, I can say nothing respecting its efficiency.  According to my experience, too, it is useless to paint the bodies with a  strong solution of corrosive sublimate ; it spoils the specimens and  does not protect them. I have also tried disembowelling the large  moths and stuffing them with cotton, subsequently saturating it with  corrosive sublimate; but this does not protect the thorax against their  ravages. The boxes and drawers of a collection should therefore be  inspected frequently, for the purpose of ascertaining if any destruc-  tive insects are present, this being immediately revealed to the eye by  a little heap of dust or excrement beneath the specimens attacked.  The collection may be kept either in drawers covered with glass, or  in wooden boxes; the latter should be three inches deep and twelve by  eighteen or twenty inches clear measurements, opening in the centre  of the depth on hinges, and defended from dust by a short 7'abhet  around the inside of the lower portion. The boxes should have one  of their measurements about twelve inches, because the cork is usually  cut in pieces about this length. A cabinet of drawers, each lined  with cork and covered with a glass, enables one to view the insects  without danger of accident by touch, but it would be more expensive  than simple boxes. Mr. Titian Peale, of Washington City, has an  extensive cabinet, which for beauty^ security, and convenience, excels  anything I have ever seen. The cases consist of a light square frame  about twelve inches by nine inches, which are bound in an ordinary  cover like a folio volume, and arranged on the shelves of a case like  books; the frame is supplied with a glass on each side and made per-  fectly tight in grooves by means of thin foil. The space the insect  occupies having been previously ascertained, a section of a cork for  vials is fixed to the glass, together with the number of the specimen,  by means of black varnish. This arrangement enables one to examine  both sides of the expanded insect without any difficulty, and excludes  insects and dust completely. It will be a source of pleasure to Mr.  Peale, I am sure, to give those who are desirous of forming a cabinet  in imitation of his plan more specific directions than I can respecting  the construction of these entomological volumes. He assured me they  are not expensive, and that any one can soon learn to make and bind  them as they are wanted, as he himself has been in the practice of  doing for many years. His collection has been in his possession more   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS, 197  than twenty years, and he has never lost a specimen during that  period from the ravages of other insects ; those, therefore, who wish  to accumulate a cabinet would do well to commence from the begin-  ning on a plan which will release them from all future care respecting  it; besides forming a most appropriate ornament either for study or  parlor.  We have now reached the conclusion of a pleasing task, undertaken  in the hope that it might subserve the purpoire of leading many active,  intelligent, and inquiring minds to observe the little people of the  insect world, to share the delights, pleasures, and knowledge that  communication with Nature never fails to bestow, or to contend for  the honorable distinctions which always follow an earnest and per-  severing devotion to the study of natural history. As this paper is  intended chiefly for the use of the novice, we have sought simply to  show how that which is manipulative can be best performed, and to  record such experience as might benefit them on their entrance into  this new world. It is, I know, looked upon as insignificant, the  domain of plagues, pests, and human annoyances, by many, a great  many in our own country who should be better informed, but are,  perhaps, unobserving and unreflecting, and the attention and study  given to these beings considered a waste of the fleeting hours of life  which should be devoted to lofty and noble purposes. They forget,  or do not know, that the works of Nature are all alike intricately  planned, the result of thought and premeditation which binds the  most dissimilar departments into intimate and dependent relation-  ships, that no one can be studied without involving a knowledge of  the others, which meet us boldly and constantly face to face on every  pathway of knowledge. They forget that all branches of natural  science are but little rays of light emanating from the great source  of it all, lighting up and beautifying the human soul, which is en-  dowed with capacities to absorb it and assimilate it to itself; and  thus the occupation of the students of God's works, unlike that of the  patient alchemists of olden time, who sought to seize the occult mys-  teries, transmutation and immortality, becomes an effort to accumu-  late and illustrate those truths, which transmute disbelief into golden  thought and life-invigorating faith. Do not the lives of many votaries  of natural science verify the pretension ? The tearful life of the great  Swammerdam, the patient and accurate historian, the acute and tender  investigator of the lives and structure of the insect, who, had he  enriched the world with that emanation of his genius the microscope  alone, and left unwritten his great and immortal work, would have  been entitled to the gratitude of every lover of knowledge â€” to an  immortality of praise. Poor, and almost friendless, he became, per-  haps, the originator of the science of entomology ; and I can see him,  even now, choosing rather to follow heaven's own light than to  abandon it for the ease of an exacting parent's hearthstone, wander-  ing houseless and needy through the ancient streets of Amsterdam,  spurned from the doors that should have been opened to receive him,  and disinherited of a patrimony that to him would have been princely,  contemplating painfully the necessity of separating himself for gold  from the cherished objects of careful accumulation and study, his frame   198 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.  shattered and emaciated by an insidious fever, excessive application  and the wolf-like gnawings of gaunt want, but patient and gentle,  self devoted and undiscouraged, and in the midst of all the gloom and  disappointments of a laborious and short career, in the very last hours  of life finding a tender consolation in the friendship and religious  mysticism of Antonia Bourignon, until death gently and slowly led  the great, good soul down to his secluded valley, and bade him rest  and sleep. But still he does not sleep ; his memory lives to animate  many desponding minds, to invigorate many faint hearts.  The pages of entomological history are adorned, too, by the names  of many of the gentler sex, and their accomplishments and graces have  served to beautify the study. The sympathy of woman with all that  is tender and beautiful in nature, the delicacy and facility with which  they manipulate minute objects, would seem to indicate this study as  one which should be with them a favorite and congenial pursuit ; and  I could instance at least one example of its successful cultivation in  our own country, if I deemed it proper, without appealing to the mag-  nificent works of the heroic Maria Sibilla de Merian, or the minute  and pains-taking investigations of Mademoiselle Jurine. ^' I have  seen the young London beauty,\" says the eloquent Kingsley, in  Glaucus, \"amid all the excitement and temptation of luxury and  flattery, with her heart pure and her mind occupied in a boudoir full  of shells and fossils, flowers and sea-weeds, and keeping herself  unspotted from the world by considering the lilies of the field, how  they grow.\" The feelings of repulsiveness with which insects are so  frequently regarded, arising from antipathies produced by false educa-  tion and false ideas, soon vanish when once we become acquainted  with their lives. We recognize in each species a distinct and indi-  vidual biography. We perceive they are influenced by many of the  same passions and instincts that animate the higher animals ; that  Iheir existence presents a marked and striking contrast even to our  own. Ours is ushered by the beautiful, bright days of fresh youth_,  during which we seem to flutter idly from pleasure to pleasure, only  to descend surely and slowly to the dark and languid days of decrepit  age ; while theirs is entered upon in sombreness and toil, and weighed  down in unwieldy and unattractive forms, to rise at last from its long  obscurity to the sweet sunlight and the blue heavens, to a youthful-  ness in which they die glorified. Everything, indeed, in the little  lives we would endeavor to interpret and understand, appeals harmo-  niously to our sympathies, even the coincidences of nature established  for their well being, or which glide into their histories. Let us mark  a coincidence. The soft voice of springtime, and its warmest breath,  arouses vegetation from its long night of winter sleep, and we admire  the early flowers rising from the earth, and opening glad eyes in the  sunlight, till on the green hill-sides and the meadows is spread an invi-  ting banquet. And even whilst we ask ourselves for whom, or what,  all this decoration and renovation of prairie and hill-side is intended â€”  for whom the magnificent festive board is spread? the answer is brought  to our ears, when at the same time the influence which has awakened  vegetation calls forth from the waters, the earth, and places of cunning  concealment, the insects, whose structure and forms declare they were   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 199  designed to be the presiding revellers in a scene so full of poetry and  beauty.  The most active and ardent, as v/ell as delicately constituted natures  and minds, will always find enough to interest and stimulate them in  this study ; leading them gradually onward in the simple path of ob-  servation to obscure questions and more intricate problems, which  become clear and light under the touch of rightly directed investi-  gation. It is quite impossible, however, that every one should be a  naturalist ; but there are few who may not with care and the cultiva-  tion of habits of accuracy become most excellent observers, improve  thereby their general health, and extend the range of their daily  pleasures and the congenial and invigorating friendships, which result  from the mutual predilections for the same branch of knowledge.  The beginner to whom the subject is novel will doubtless meet with  many sources of discouragement, but it should only serve to stimulate  him to increased application, and inculcate lessons of patience and  heedfulness. He will be compelled to acquire the simple technical  knowledge in ordinary use, and which can be met with in almost any  entomological work ; and this done, he can then confine himself to de-  tailing the histories of larva3 development^ or subsequently engage in  the more complicated study of classification, which the information  he has obtained by observation will the more readily enable him to un-  derstand, in the special expositions of the relations of these beings to  each other. The object of these remarks is to encourage observation  and the practice of recording its results, especially amongst those who  are conscious they can do so clearly and well, quite as much as the accu-  mulation of collections of perfect insects. The necessity which de-  mands the former may be conceived from the fact that the history of  scarcely any of our described Lepidoptera is known in all its essential  particulars, and therefore attention can scarcely be given to this sub-  ject and be unrewarded by some good results. The note booh should  be the inseparable companion of the observer, and every fact detailed,  every observation recorded ; no matter how trivial it may appear at  the time, no one will be inclined to laugh at it, except those whose  wit lies on the surface of life \" as idle as a painted ship upon a painted  ocean.\" And then, how worse than useless it is to devote time to an  object at once praiseworthy and beneficial, yet leave no marks of your  progress and labor, by which others may be spared the necessity of  traversing the same round of observation which you had long since  performed but neglected to render available to whomsoever might be  attracted to the same course of study. There never comes to my  knowledge an instance of this kind without vividly recalling theun-  ^yorthy servant and his single talent, and I am tempted to exclaim,  he is justly deprived of the honors and distinctions he might have  shared, inasmuch as he has selfishly buried his \"talent\" in the re-  cesses of his own mind.  \" Some, perhaps, of those who read the preceding remarks will ask,  What is the use of entomology? These I would ask to consider  what they mean by use; they will find, I think, though they may not  like to confess it, that their idea of a useful thing is, a thing which  can be turned into money. But money itself is only valuable in as   200 GRASSHOPPERS AND LOCUSTS  far as it contributes to happiness, whether bodily or mental ; and even  if the tendency to health, which is given by the regular habits, tem-  perance and industry, without which no one can be an entomologist,  are to be considered of no value, still the constant interest without  anxiety or disappointment, the gentle exertion without overstraining  the mind, and the contemplation of the universal beneficence of the  Creator even towards the smallest of his creatures, can hardly fail to  bring to the mind a peaceful happiness which none but a philosopher  can appreciate, and even he cannot describe. If, indeed, he could, in-  stead of the few who devote themselves to the study and observation  of animated nature, there would be scarcely any who would not be-  come naturalists.\"  Let it not, however, be supposed that the way to philosophic heights  is smooth and easy, and that the book of Nature can be read without  first acquiring the alphabet in which it is written. But whilst its  pages invite all to investigation, even those who run the course of a  busy life, its records can be fully deciphered only, perhaps, by those  few chosen spirits whom she has selected as her interpreters, who pass  through a long and laborious pupilage, who are content to labor with-  out other hope of reward than that which knowledge brings, and to  sit childlike at her feet, learning to lisp the accents of the language  in which she expresses her startling and profound conceptions. And  without aspiring to deep acquirements, without seeking to merit the  designation of naturalists, we can prepare the way for the advent of  this chosen spirit in the field of entomology in America, and feel our-  selves elevated in mind and benefitted in body by the devotion of  leisure time to intelligent and systematic observation of even those  beings which may have been heretofore considered unworthy of notice,  but which at least teach us that \" there's never a leaf or a blade too  mean to be some happy creatures palace.\" It will be a most accept-  able labor to the intelligent everywhere, and in the end must convince  the most practical minded that \" Whatever it has been worth God's  while to create, it must be worth man's while to study.\"   AN ACCOUNT OF THE GRASSHOPPERS AND LOCUSTS OF AMERICA, CON-  DENSED FROM AN ARTICLE WRIITEN AND FURNISHED BY ALEXANDER  S. TAYLOR, ESQ , OF MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA.   From the periodical press we learn that, up to the 11th of Octo-  ber, 1855, and commencing about the middle of May, these insects  extended themselves over a space of the earth's surface much greater  than has ever before been noted. They covered the entire Territories  of Washington and Oregon, and every valley of the State of Cali-  fornia, ranging from the Pacific ocean to the eastern base of the Sierra  Nevada ; the entire Territories of Utah and New Mexico ; the immense  grassy prairies lying on the eastern slopes of the Kocky Mountains ;  the dry mountain valleys of the republic of Mexico, and the countries   OF AMERICA. 201  of Lower California and Central America, and also those portions of  the State of Texas which resemble, in physical characteristics, Utah  and California. The records prove that the locusts extended them-  selves, in one year, over a surface comprised within thirty-eight degrees  of latitude, and, in the broadest part, eighteen degrees of longitude.  On several days in June, July, and August, of 1855, the grass-  hoppers (or langostas of the Spaniards) were seen in such incredible  numbers in the valley of Sacramento, in California ; in the valley  of Colima, in Southwest Mexico ; in the valley of the Great Salt Lake ;  in Western Texas, and certain valleys of Central America, that they  filled the air, like flakes of snow on a winter's day, and attacked  everything green or succulent with a voracity and despatch destructive  to the hopes of agriculturists.  To stimulate inquiries founded on original observation of the  locust. Col. Warren, editor of the California Farmer, forwarded a  short circular note to several periodicals, dated July 2, 1855, in which  he states that, \"for the last three days, the very air has been so full  of them over this city (Sacramento) as to resemble a dense snow  storm. Large fields of oats and wheat have suffered in lone and other  upper (Sierra Nevada) valleys.\"  The Sacramento Union, of the same date, states that the ''most  remarkable circumstance we have ever been called on to notice in this  locality was the flight of the grasshoppers on Saturday and yester-  day. For about three hours in the middle of the day the air, at an  elevation of about two hundred feet, was literally thick with them,  flying in the direction of Yolo. They could be the more readily per-  ceived by looking in the direction of the sun. Great numbers fell  upon the streets on Saturday â€” absolutely taking the city by storm â€”  and yesterday they commenced the wholesale destruction of every-  thing green in the gardens of the neighborhood. Their flight, en masse,  resembled a thick snow-storm, and their depredations the sweep of a  scythe. The prevalence of the scourge is explained by Dr. T. M.  Logan as being attributable to the great warmth and dryness of the  present season â€” circumstances favorable to an early development of  the eggs of the insect, which is deemed one of the most fruitful in the  animal kingdom.\"  The Shasta Courier, printed in the northern Sacramento moun-  tains, remarks that \"on Wednesday last (September 19, 1855,) an  immense flight of grasshoppers passed over this place, flying west-  ward. The greater portion of them flew very high, and could only  be seen by shading the eyes from the sun. They were as thick in the  heavens as flakes of snow in a winter storm.\"  The Sacramento Valley papers mention that whole orchards,  gardens, and vineyards have been consumed by them. Entire fields  of young grain, of crops, and vegetables, have been eaten up within  the space of a single day, leaving the ground like a wilted, bhxckened  desert. In some parts of the valley they annoyed the passengers and  horses of the public stages to such an extent as to cause the greatest  inconvenience, and appear, in some cases, to have positively endangered  human life.  A gentleman who resided in Colusi coun'y, ia the Sacramento   202 GRASSHOPPERS AND LOCUSTS  valley, in the summer of 1855, informs us tliat these insects appeared  to rise out of the eastern boundaries of the valley, where it is hot, dry,  and sandy, and that, on some days, they filled the air so as to obscure  the sun. They consumed all garden vegetables, the leaves and bark  of the elder tree, and the young leaves and bark of the small branches  of the cotton-wood and willow, and even the soft, green parts of the  tules or bullrushes. In Stony Creek, in the same county, their dead  bodies were seen, at one time, completely covering the surface of the  â€¢water for miles in extent. In some parts of this valley they ate  through gauze and textile coverings of all kinds^ which had been used  to shield animals and plants from their attacks.  The grasshoppers appeared in 1855 in much larger numbers in  the valley of the Sacramento and the mountains which bound it on the  eastern or Sierra Nevada side than in any other part of California,  and here and in Utah they committed the greatest ravages. In the  southern coast counties they were comparatively few in number and  did very little injury. They were more troublesome around Los  Angelos than anywhere else in the south.  The Oregon Times of September 29 says: \"In the southern part  of Oregon, the present season, grasshoppers have been ravaging the  country, utterly destroying every green vegetable substance. In cer-  tain localities whole nurseries of fruit trees have been killed and  entire fields of grain have been destroyed. The grasshoppers infested  northern California last year, and seem to be making a pilgrimage  through Oregon. This year they have done but little damage on this  side of the Calapooia mountains, but are getting quite numerous in  Linn, Lane, and Benton counties. They have infested portions of  California the past season_, sweeping all before them ; and in Utah  they have destroyed at least one-half of the crops. Fences, ditches,  or streams seem to present no barriers to their ravages.\"  The Great Salt Lake News of 19th September states that ''on  Thursday, 29th August, several millions of grasshoppers descended  on the settlements north of Utah county, destroying everything green  in their way. The county of Tooele was visited by a similar plague.\"  The following extract from a Texas paper (Dallas Gazette, No-  vember 20, 1855) will show their appearance in that State. \" Grass-  hoppers are beginning to be troublesome in this vicinity. We hear  some of our farmers complaining a great deal of their depredations.  Some of the wheat that has been lately sown is completely destroyed,  and the fields will have to be replanted. A heavy norther would rid  lis of these insects.\"  From the various notices of the visits of the Locusta in 1855,  made by the periodicals of California, Utah, Washington, and Oregon,  it would appear that they are most abundant from the fifteenth of  July to the twentieth of September, or a period of sixty-seven days.  They would seem also to be at the maturity of their destructive power  from the first to the thirty-first of August, which is the hottest and  driest month of the year in all these regions.  It may be remarked, in this connexion, that the summer of 1855,  and up to the 3lÂ£t of October, was the driest which has been known  for ten years.   OF AMERICA. 203  The grasshoppers made their appearance again in I806 in Oregon,  Utah, and California, and in Texas, near Austin, and westward,  but in such diminished numbers as not to do extensive harm, ex-  cept in particular localities. But it seems, from the periodical press,  that in the upper Mississippi (Minnesota, &c.) they committed great  injury in the fall of that year, as the following extract will show :  \"At Little Falls (says the St. Anthony Express) they destroyed corn,  oats, wheat, and every kind of grain which came in their way. At  Elk river they appeared in a perfect cloud, and lighting upon a corn-  field of twenty acres destroyed the whole crop in a short space of  time. At Crow Wing, on the farm of Isaac Moulton, they destroyed  five hundred bushels of oats.\"  Their ravages extended along the first central mesas or steppes,  bordering eastward the Eocky mountains, covering the dry soils of  Texas, and down into the south of Mexico. In the vicinity of Cordova,  in the State of Vera Cruz, the people made \"a regular campaign  against them, and succeeded in destroying one hundred and ninety-  two arrobas, computed as numbering four hundred millions of grass-  hoppers,\" In the State of Guerrero they also did great injury, par-  ticularly witliin the districts around Acapulco.  It would seem that the Locusta makes its destructive appearance  within the boundaries of the United States Territories, west of the  Mississippi, in some portion or other nearly every year. The follow-  ing extract from a correspondent of the New York Tribune, dated  Fort Kearny, August 31, 1857, and who was in the expedition of  Colonel Sumner against the Cheyenne Indians of the upper branches  of the Missouri, shows the efi'ect of the reappearance of this plague in  a strong light :  \"The grass along our route has been short and scanty, although  refreshed by the recent rains. It is injured by myriads of grass-  hoppers, some of which are monstrous in size. I have noticed several  between three and four inches, and many nearly three inches long.  Last Friday a swarm passed over the fort which darkened the sun so  as to render it possible to gaze at it with the naked eye. AVe saw  this swarm at a distance of ten or twelve miles, at which it resembled  a cloud of smoke.\"  Every western man remembers the visitation of grasshoppers  in 1855 and 1856 in Kansas, Nebraska, and Minnesota Territories,  â€¢which caused such injury to the crops of the Indians. In the travels  of Jonathan Carver, in the northwest parts of the Mississippi and  Lake countries, published in 1779, page 494, the following mention  is made of the locust or grasshopper: \"I must not omit to mention  that the locust is a septennial insect, as they are only seen, a small  number of stragglers excepted, every seven years, when they infest  these parts and the interior colonies in large swarms and do a great  deal of mischief. The years when they thus arrive are denominated  the locust years.\"  Since 1823 the grasshoppers have several times ravaged the  fields and gardens of the Franciscan missions of Upper California.  About the year 1827 or 1828 they ate up nearly all the growing  crops, and occasioned a great scarcity of wholesome food. At the   204 GRASSHOPPEES AND LOCUSTS  mission of Santa Clara, Padre Jose Viadere fired the pastures, and  getting all his neophytes together made such an awful noise that those  which were not killed by the smoke and fires were frightened ofi\" so  thoroughly as to save the grain crops and the mission fruit gardens.  About 1834-'35 occurred another visitation of the grasshopper, when  they destroyed a second time the crops of the rancheros and missions,  with the exception of the wheat.  An American settler, who resided for ten years near the bay  of San Francisco, informs us that in the summer of 1838 the crops  and gardens of the missions and ranches thereabouts were nearly  destroyed by the ravages of the grasshopper. Another settler informs  us that they committed great ravages near San Rafael, and on the  north side of the bay. He saw them eat up, in a single afternoon, a  field of thirty acres of beans and peas, consuming it to the surface of  the ground. In these districts they stopped for three successive years.  A California sea captain informs me that he has sailed through the  Santa Barbara channel and neighboring waters when the surface of  the ocean was covered for miles with the dead bodies of grasshoppers,  the air being filled with them at the same time, and shoals of fish  feeding on them.  In July, 1846, a friend of ours living in Monterey was per-  sonally cognizant of afield of eight or nine acres on the Salinas plains  of corn, frijoles, &c., being completely consumed to the ground  in a single day. The appearance of the field afterwards was as if it  had been blackened and killed by a heavy frost. The late Mr. J. B.  Wall, collector of Monterey, informed me that in a journey from  Oregon to Missouri, in 1846, his party encountered in July, on the  plains near the north fork of the river Platte, myriads of the grass-  hoppers, which all appeared to be travelling northward, and proved  extremely annoying to the train for many days. Bryant, in his  \" What I saw in California/' relates that on his passage to California,  under dates of July, 1846, their company of emigrants also encountered  immense swarms of grasshoppers on the prairies near the Platte.  In the \"Utah and the Mormons,\" by B. G. Ferris, on page 149,  mention is thus made of the visitation of the Locusta in the Salt Lake  country : \" The year 1848 was one of privation and suffering, prior  to the maturing of the growing crops. Among other discouraging  incidents a curious kind of ' cricket' made its appearance in myriads,  manifesting all the destructive properties of eastern countries. All  vegetation was swept clean before its frightful progress as effectually  as the grass before the scorching fury of a prairie conflagration, and  the crops, put in with so much toil and on which so much depended,  were fast disappearing. Suddenly,' however, flocks of white gulls  floated over the mountain tops with healing in their wings, and stayed  this withering destruction by feasting on the destroyer. The crickets  and the gulls have been annual visitors siuce, as they were before ;  the bane and the antidote come together.\" They are said to appear  invariably in great numbers in very dry and hot summers, succeeding  to very inclement winters.  Throughout California, with its ante-1849 boundaries, through-  out Lower California, New Mexico, and all the dry and the elevated   OF AMERICA. 205  mesas or plateaus of the republic of Mexico, their ravages have been  noted by the old Spanish chroniclers from the iirst conquest and set-  tlement of the countries; also by American trappers, hunters, and  travellers throughout the same regions for the last fifty-five years,  and by English, Russian, and French writers and navigators. Dr.  Dwight mentions that they have several times been extremely inju-  rious to the growing crops of New England prior to 1800.  It would seem that the most feasible means of destroying the  grasshopper, or diminishing its propagation and increase, is that which  nature and circumstances suggest. The extensive conflagration of the  grassy plains and hills of California has been noticed ever since the  years 1542-'43, in the account of the voyage of Juan Rodrigues  Cabillo, and particularly near San Pedro, (the present embarcadero  for Los Angeles,) which he named the Bay of Smoke. The entire  range of California, Utah, and Eastern Oregon, and neighboring  countries being deserts, prairies, or lands of hills and mountains  sparsely covered with trees, and everywhere thickly or thinly with  grasses, we know they become excessively dry for three months of the  year, when they either take fire from accident or design, or, as is most  likely in some cases, from the attrition of the leaves and glazed stalks  in a dry and windy day. As soon as the parched vegetation is fired,  with a good breeze of wind it will burn an immense district of country  before it is stopped by a wide road, a dry river bed, running water, or  damp ground. In its progress it consumes all animated nature not  capable of speedy flight or escape, and destroys the undeveloped larvae  and millions of eggs of the grasshopper, as well as thousands of the  full grown insects, whose wings and legs get singed and burnt in  trying to make their escape from the devouring element. The wind  at times conspires to bring immense numbers of them within the in-  fluence of the fire, and so to stifle them as to bring them to the ground.  In a strong gale, when swarms of grasshoppers are on the wing high  in the air, they are swept along until, as the breeze slackens, they fall  into the waters of large bays, seas, and cover large extents of the  surface of the ocean, where they become a prey to greedy fishes.  The annual conflagration of our plains occurred this year (1855)  very early, which circumstance had considerable effect in destroying  the swarms of grasshoppers, as, to escape the heat, they endeavored  to keep out of the influence of the fires, and being driven before  the winds, were swept into Siuson bay in incredible numbers. The  passengers in the steamer from Sacramento to San Francisco, on  Saturday, the 14th of July, state that they fell in such numbers into  the waters of the bay as to completely cover in places the surface.  \"When driven ashore afterwards with the tides they filled the air with  an intolerable stench.  The Indians take the grasshoppers in great numbers by sweep-  ing them into holes or piles, or by surrounding tliem with fire and  driving them into the centre, and afterwards roasting and pounding  them for food. But this is always found to sicken the Indians â€”  a fact which has been noted by the pioneer settlers and natives  of old, as also by many travellers and voyagers who have visited   206 GRASSHOPPERS AND LOCUSTS  California and the Eocky mountain country, and also by the Jesuits  of Lower California.  The species found near Monterey, and examined in October, were  of a burnt sienna color, one inch and three-eighths long by one-eighth  of an inch thick, with three black blotches on each outer wing ; the  legs are also barred black ; the lower body parts of ochreous yellow ;  the inside wings, which are very thin, are yellowish, with a broad  black, fringe. The head is of a lighter color than the body, and is as  hard as the shell of a peanut. The mouth is armed with two hard,  black forceps, nearly one-eighth of an inch long, the inside edges of  which are bevelled inwards, finely serrated, and very keen. Four of  these October grasshoppers (males and full-grown) weighed thirty  grains.  We may note here that the grasshoppers in July around Mon-  terey, where but few came this year, are not more than half the size  that they are in October. The species of grasshopper described  in Captain Stansbury's journey to the Salt Lake country, in 1850, and  figured and described by Professor S. Haldeman, is a species of the  Locusta different in size, colors, and particular features from that  found near Monterey. Haldeman calls this Salt Lake grasshopper  the Oedipoda corallipes, and says that it is congeric with the Oedipoda  migratoria of the English naturalists, and which is found so destructive  in Asia Minor and the Crimea, The corallipes is nearly as large as  the migratoria, being two and a half inches long. The California  grasshopper, or rather the species found near Monterey, I have seldom  seen over one and a half inches long, and it is not in any manner  colored \"bright vermilion\" in any part of its body, as is mentioned  by Haldeman of the Salt Lake species. There is only one species of  the Locusta described in the above work. It has either no antenna?,  or it is faintly delineated. The date of preservation or capture of this  Oedipoda of Utah is not stated by Haldeman.  The following account from Cage's West Indies, page 368, will  show the effects of a visitation of the Locusta in the parishes of  Mixco and Pinola, and other parts of the uplands of Guatemala in  the year 1632:  \" The first year of my abiding there it pleased God to send one of  the plagues of Egypt to that country, which was of locusts, which I  had never seen till then. They were after the manner of our grass-  hoppers, but somewhat bigger, which did fly about in number so  thick and infinite that they did truly cover the face of the sun, and  hinder the shining forth of the beams of that bright planet. Where  they lighted, either upon trees or standing corn, there nothing was  expected but ruin, destruction, and barrenness; for the corn they de-  voured, the fruits of trees they ate and consumed, and hung so thick  upon the branches that with their weight they tore them from the  body. The highways were so covered with them that they startled  the travelling mules with their fluttering about their heads and feet.  My eyes were often struck with their wings as I rode along; and much  ado 1 had to see my way, what with a montero, wherewith I was fain  to cover my face, what with the flight of them which were still before  my eyes. The i'armers towards the South sea coast cried out, for that   OF AMERICA. 207  their indigo, whic\"h was then in grass, was like to be eaten up; from  the Ingenios of sugar the like moan was made, that the young and  tender sugar-canes would be destroyed; but, above all, grievous was  the cry of the husbandmen of the valley where I lived, who feared  that their corn would in one night be swallowed up by that devouring  legion. The care of the magistrate was that the towns of Indians  should all go out into the fields with trumpets, and what other  instruments they had, to make a noise and to affright them from  those places which are most considerable and profitable to the com-  monwealth; and strange it was to see how the loud noise of the  Indians and sounding of the trumpets defended some fields from the  fear and danger of them. Where they lighted in the mountains and  highways, there they left behind them their young ones, which were  found creeping upon the ground, ready to threaten such a second  year's plague if not prevented; wherefore all the towns were called,  with spades, mattocks, and shovels to dig long trenches^, and therein  to bury all the young ones. Thus, with much trouble to the poor  Indians and their great pains, (yet after much hurt and loss in many  places,) was that flying pestilence chased away out of the country to  the South sea, where it was thought to be consumed by the ocean,  and to have found a grave in the waters, whilst the young ones found  it in the land. Yet they were not all so buried; but that shortly some  appeared, which, being not so many in number as before, were, with  the former diligence, soon overcome.\"  Clavigero, in his history of Mexico, says of the Locusta of  Mexico, that no animal or insect in that country \"can compare in  numbers or ravages with the locusts which, sometimes darkening the  air like thick clouds, lay waste all the vegetation of the country, as I  have myself witnessed in the year 1738 or 1739 upon the coasts of  Xicayan, in Oaxuaca. From this cause a great famine was lately  occasioned in the province of Yucatan; but no country in America has  been visited by this dreadful scourge so often as the wretched Cali-  fornia, as related by Father Michael del Barco, who lived thirty years  in that country as one of the missionaries of our society.\"  The same author gives the following interesting account in his  History of California:  \" For the reason that this plague does not afiect the countries  where naturalists may carefully observe them with minuteness and  exactness, we herein relate the account of one of our missionaries,,  kept for thirty years, during his residence in the missions of old Cali-  fornia.  \"There are three species of California grasshoppers, which are  similar in form, but distinct in size, color, and mode of living. The  first species, which is well known and the best observed, is small; it  flies short, but is constantly jumping. The second species is larger,  and of a gray color. These two kinds are not found in such numbers  as to make them of such note or anxiety as the third, which is the  largest, and causes the most destruction in its flights over the lands  of the peninsula.  \"The grasshoppers of this third species, famous for tlieir ravages  among the lands of the missions, is of the size of a little finger ; the   208 GRASSHOPPERS AND LOCUSTS  wings double like the others, bat larger and colored variably, according  to their age and sex, which we shall hereafter note.  \" These largest grasshoppers are those we shall particularly account  for in what we relate. They assimilate in their habits and modes of  generation to those of the silk worm. The two sexes come together in  the hottest days of the summer season ; the female, at the latter part of  July or early in August, lays a number of fine, small eggs of a yellowish  color, in a string, united with a glutinous matter, which, on being  perceived, appears like a cord of fine silk. These are deposited together  and dropped into a small hole which they make in the ground with a  small apparatus attached to their tails. Each female lays from seventy  to eighty eggs, and sometimes more. Shortly after fulfilling the great  law of nature, the grasshoppers quickly degenerate and die without  taking care of their lives or of each other_, but leaving in their eggs  the seeds of a numerous posterity.  \" The birth of these new grasshoppers has no particular time, but  is dependent on the early or late appearance of the rains, but generally  hatch during the latter part of September or early in October, when,  from the scarce rains of California, the germs and buds of plants are  left in the fields. Shortly after birth, while they are without wings,  their lower legs are very large but shaped like those of a mosquito; the  color of the insect is then a dark gray. Their first exercise is to jump  on to the nearest green thing. If there is none near by they keep  jumping and moving to the nearest green plant, and generally in com-  pany with those of the same nest and mother. As soon as they have  consumed the leaves of one plant they pass to another, by little assuming  a brighter color, and then the difierent families begin to unite. When  they arrive at half size their color is a perfect green. At this time their  legs have become strong and they jump higher and farther, and exer-  cise and contrive the best method for seeking their food while passing  along the fields. A few days after assuming their green coat, they  cast their skin or outer covering, and then display their four wings  which are close shut to their bodies. The color then becomes green,  mixed with dark gray. When they are three months old they are com-  plete in size, form, and features, and become of a reddish gray with  blackish spots. Its appearance as thus seen is the only beauty of this  pestilent plague of California. They maintain these features until the  hot, dry weather, when they become yellowish until their death.  Their life, from birth to death, lasts ten months, during which they  cast their coats twice and change their colors five times.  \" When their wings have become of sufficient strength and the body  at its maturity, they then begin to ascend into the air and fly like  birds, and commence their ravages in every direction, desolating the  fields of every green thing. Their numbers become so extraordinary  that they soon form clouds in the atmosphere which the rays of the  sun cast a shadow as they fly. They unite in masses often and twelve  thousand, always following their conductors and flying in a direct line  without falling behind, for they consume every growing thing before  them. To whatever height their guides conduct them to obtain a sight  of their food they follow, and as soon as growing crops or any ver-  dure is sighted, instantly the swarm will alight and speedily devour   OF AMERICA. 209  and devastate the fields around to that extent and with that prompti-  tude that when they are seen by a new swarm of their fellows, there  is not anythinÂ«5 more left to injure or consume. In the night they  neither eat nor sleep, but are all the time mounting and jumping on  each other in thick masses, and bending and cracking with their weight  the branches of the shrubs and trees they may cover or rest on.*  \"â–  This lamentable insect-plague is bad enough in old and cultivated  countries, but in the miserable peninsula of California, where they  eat up the crops, green trees, fruits, and pastures, they cause great  mortality in the domestic animals of the missions, and with the effects  of their ravages on the cereal and other garden productions, cause  great famines and sickness among the inhabitants and neophytes of  the establishments. Atone time immense multitudes of these vora-  cious insects died, infecting the air dreadfully with the stench of their  corruption and decay.  \"The grasshoppers do not generally attack such plants as water-  melons and melons, for the reason that such plants have leaves covered  with fine pricking hairs. The pitahayos are naturally defended with  their spires and prickles, and with the other cactus family are not dis-  turbed, except in their flowers and ripe fruit. In the mescal plant  they only attack the extremities of the j;e??cas without touching the  shoot or sprout, which is a species of aliment used by the Indians.  \"From the year 1G97, when the Jesuits commenced the labor of  christianizing the heathens of California, the grasshoppers had not  made their appearance in the lands formed by the missions until the  year 1722, when they made their appearance, and then ceased until  1746, and for three years immediately following without intermission.  After this they did not return until 1753 and 1754, and, finally again,  before the expulsion of the fathers in 1705, 1766, and 1767. For many  reasons has this unhappy peninsula, for several consecutive years,  escaped the affliction of the plague of locusts. Probably in certain  seasons their eggs could not be hatched for the exceptions of the fall  of ordinary rains, as sometimes here occurs, and also for the abundance  or their eggs consumed by the birds. Also, it is stated, that in the  spring of the year incredible numbers of the grasshoppers are killed  by a certain worm which is engendered in the stomach of the locusts,  and which commits great havoc amongst them ; for this reason,  probably, and others mentioned, and some as yet unknown causes,  they have not made their appearance in large numbers in the seasons  elapsed between the years mentioned.  \"Anciently the Indians of the California missions used the grass-  hoppers as food, by first toasting them, and, after extracting the  entrails, pulverizing them before eating. But the good counsels of  the missionaries, after their appearance in 1722, when this species of  food occasioned among them a great sickness, caused them to leave off  using them, though some of the neophytes still would eat them in the  years when food became scarce from their ravages in the sowings.\"  The following account is taken from the New Notes on Central  America, by E. Gr. Squier, from which it will be seen that the  * Itis last fact was noted by the nurserymen of Sacramento in 1855. â€” A. S. T.  14   210 GRASSHOPPEKS AND LOCUSTS  Locusta of Central America is nearly if not quite identical witli that  of California :  \"The insect, however, which is most dreaded in Honduras, as,  indeed, in all Central America, is the Langosta, or Chapulin, a spe-  cies of grasshopper or loou&t, which at intervals afflicts the entire  country, passing from one end to the other in vast columns of many  millions, literally darkening the air and destroying everything green  in their course. I once (in 1853) rode through one of these columns  which was fully ten miles in width. Not only did the insects cover  the ground, rising in clouds on each side of the mule path as I ad-  vanced, hut the open pine forest was brown with their myriad bodies,  as if the trees had been seared with fire, while the air was filled with  them as it is with falling flakes in a snow storm. Their course is  always from south to north. They make their first appearance as  Sallones, of diminutive size, red bodies and wingless, when they swarm  over the ground like ants. At this time vast numbers of them are  killed by the natives, who dig long trenches, two or three feet deep, and  drive the Salfones into them. Unable to leap out, tbe trench soon be-  comes half filled with the young insects, when the earth is shoveled  back, and they are thus buried and destroyed. They are often driven  in this way into the rivers and drowned. Various expedients are  resorted to by the owners of plantations to prevent the passing columns  from alighting. Sulphur is burned in the fields, guns are fired, drums  beaten, and every mode of making a noise put in requisition for the pur-  pose. In this mode detached plantations are often saved. But when the  columns once alight, no device can avail to rescue them from speedy  desolation. In a single hour the largest maize fields are stripped of  â€¢their leaves, and only the stems are left to indicate that they once  existed.  \"It is said that the CJiapuUn makes its appearance at the end of  periods of about fifty years, and that it then prevails for from five t3  seven years, when it entirely disappears. But its habits have never  been studied with care, and I am unprepared to affirm anything in  these respects. Its ordinary size is from two and a half to four inches  in length, but it sometimes grows to the length of five inches.  \" The crops of maize are often destroyed by the locusts in the course  of a few hours. As the visitation is usually general, it sometimes  results in a great scarcity, bordering on famine, in which case maize  advances to as high as four and five and even ten dollars per bushel.  Fortunately the insect seldom attacks the fields which are planted  high up on the slopes of the mountains, where the people make their  milpalis during the periodical visitations of the Chapulin.\"  This statement is consonant with the accounts received from Hon-  duras and Guatemala of the famine and pestilence of fever in those  countries in 1855 and 1856, caused by clouds of locusts devastating  the country, and confirms Gage's history of the same lands in 1632.  At the time of the visit of Darwin to Chile and the adjacent  countries of South America, he relates of the grasshoppers as follows,  at the date of March 25, 1835, where he is crossing the dry country  which lies between the city of Mendoza, in Buenos Ayres, and the  opposite side of Chile. This country assimilates in every essential   OF AMERICA. 211  physical characteristic to that of the territories within the boundaries  of Upper and Lower California prior to the American occupation :  \" Shortly before arriving at the village and river of Luxan, we  observed, to the south, a ragged cloud of a dark reddish brown color.  At first we thought it was caused by some great fire on the neighbor-  ing plains, but we soon found that it was a swarm of locusts. They  were flying northward, and with the aid of a light breeze they over-  took us at the rate of ten or fifteen miles an hour. The main body  filled the air from a height of twenty feet to that, as it appeared, of  two or three thousand feet above the ground. The sound of their  wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle;  or rather, as I should say, like a strong breeze passing through a  ship's rigging. The sky, seen through the advanced guard, appeared  like a mezzotinto engraving; but the main body was impervious to  sight. They were not, however, so thick together but that they could  escape a stick waved backward and forward. When they alighted,  they were more numerous than the leaves in the field, and the surface  became reddish instead of green. The swarm having once alighted,  the individuals flew from side to side in all directions. Locusts are  not an uncommon pest in this country. Already, during this season,  several smaller swarms had come up from the south^ where, apparently,  as in all other parts of the world, they are bred in the deserts. The  poor cottagers in vain attempted, by lighting fires, by shouts, and by  waving branches, to arrest the attack. This species of locust closely  resembles, antl perhaps is identical, witli the Gryllus inigratorius of  Syria and Palestine.\"  It is a little singular that though the ravages of the grasshop-  pers have been noticed by all the presses of California, Utah, Oregon,  and Washington, and particularly by those of the Sacramento and  Utah valleys, not one of them has given any detailed description of the  difierent species of locusta infesting those districts of country ; nor  have any of our naturalists or observing writers made more than a  passing notice of the animal whose history hereafter will leave the  most melancholy marks of its devastation on the means of subsistence  of the people who may fill up these territories. If they have been  recorded in the annals of Africa, Asia, and Europe, for four thousand  years, and have been chronicled in the histories of the Californias for  one hundred years, we may be sure that there is nothing to prevent  their periodical devastating visits within the boundaries of the North  Pacific slope for four thousand years more.  The habits of this insect ought to be diligently observed by the  cultivators of the soil in our State. It requires from the State  authorities the employment of the best naturalists to study and com-  pile for public use the most searching investigation into the birth,  multiplication, and best methods of checking the increase of this ter-  ribly devouring and consuming pestilence.  The \"California Farmer\" of July 5, 1855, says: \"The following  facts can be relied upon, having been received from such sources as  leave no question of their correctness: Wherever the floods covered  the soil, and remained a little time, no grasshoppers appear; they  rarely or never are found in shaded grounds or damp and wet locali-   212 GRASSHOPPERS AND LOCUSTS  ties ; tliey are destroyed by winter ploughing â€” deep, subsoil plough-  ing.\"  The same paper adds: \" We have made many inquiries, and from  those who have seen and examined their habits we gather the follow-  ing: The grasshopper's shell, or his decayed body, is found about ten  or twelve inches below the surface, in the sandy soil in gardens and  orchards. Those who plough early and deep find them turned up in  large quantities, and also note that where the soil is ploughed deep  and early they do not make such ravages.  \"We learn that irrigation at night and showering the trees and vines  have, in many instances, driven them away. Heavy shade and awnings  serve as means of protection. Grounds that are low and damp, and  such as by constant cultivation give forth a dew at night, tliis insect  avoids. Shade and moisture they shun; a hot and dry location  they select, and the hotter the day, the more terrible their ravages.  The hottest days they move with more rapidity.\"  There is a bird in India termed the grakle, which is a great consu-  mer of the locusta and its eggs. This grakle, we judge, is similar to  our California chenate, or blackbird, which all know is found in the  valleys of the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and the coast, as also the  Eocky mountain countries, in such immense flocks as often to obscure  the sun ; they are incredibly abundant at some seasons in the lower  part of the Sacramento valley. The inhabitants of India have often  killed the grakle to almost extermination, from their injury to young  crops ; but when this has been effected a great multiplication occurs  of destructive insects, and particularly of the locusta, as the following,  from BufPon, will show : \" Some of the eggs of the locusta being acci-  dentally introduced from Madagascar into the French island of Bour-  bon, they multiplied so prodigiously as to threaten devastation to the  country. But the governor, a man of superior intelligence, learning  the great services of the grakle in India, had a number of pairs intro-  duced and distributed over the islands under his charge, which in-  cluded Mauritius, &c. They bred very fast, and in a few years the  locusts seemed exterminated. The grakles then began to dig and  examine the newly sown fields ; on which the colonists, concluding  that they were devouring the seed, when they were in reality seeking  the locust's eggs, took the alarm and got them exterminated by gov-  ernment. In a few years they j)erceived their error, for the locusts  soon commenced their ravages again. Upon this the government  procured a new supply of grakles, which were given in charge this  time to their ofiicers ; the physicians being instructed to declare their  meat unwholesome food. This extraordinary care, hoAvever, proved  injurious, as after the birds had cleared the islands of the locusts and  their eggs, which infested the coffee plants, the birds began to injure  the grain crops and orchards, and even to kill young pigeons and  other domestic birds ; on which means Avere taken by the government  to keep down their numbers by a measured destruction.\"  It appears that a species of blackbird, similar to the one of Califor-  nia, is found in immense numbers in Southern Russia, in Poland, the  Holy Land, Arabia, Lower Egypt, and the shores of the Mediterranean  sea. It is called the rose colored blackbird, {Pastor roseus,) and feeds   OF AMERICA. 213  on grasshoppers, locusts, and their eggs and larva, of which it can  devour incredible numbers in a da3\\ It Avas also observed in the  colony of the Cape of Good Hope, by that indeftitigable naturalist, Le  Vaillant. In the works of the great Aldrovandi, of Bologne, in Italy,  (1599,) they are called sea starlings. No doubt they are intended in  California to act as a check on the increase of grasshoppers and locusts.  The description which Alexander Wilson has left of the red winged  starling of the southern Atlantic States, (1810,) agrees precisely with  the habits of our blackbird proper, and its companion the dun-colored  thrush , as they combine together in immense flocks in the summer  and autumn months.  Wilson estimates that two millions of the starling will consume, in  three weeks, the enormous amount of sixteen thousand two hundred  millions of the eggs and larva of grasshoppers and other kindred  insects. The combined ravages of such a hideous host of insect vermin,  as Wilson remarks, is enough to spread famine and desolation over a  wide extent of cultivated country.  It will thus be seen that in the order of Providence the enormous  number of these birds found in California and the Rocky mountain  country is intended as a positive blessing, for all time to come, to the  people who may make it their home. When these regions become  filled up, in the course of two centuries, with a numerous population  of herdsmen, miners, and cultivators of grains and fruits, the value of  this bird will be keenly appreciated, and no doubt suitable laws will  be made for its protection. An old settler informs us that this bird  sometimes becomes a great ravagfer of the grain crops. In the valley  of the Pajaro they have appeared in some years in flocks of millions,  and have done great injury to the wheat and barley, when the grain  w\\as ripening. \" This also is an evil,\" but a much smaller one than  the grasshoppers.  It is suggested that collections of locusts, grasshoppers, and their  congeners be made by intelligent observers and amateurs living in dif-  ferent parts of the country. The insects should be gathered from the  eggs to the grub and the perfect animal. A number of specimens,  male and female, should be procured, and this at different seasons of  the year. The specimens may be dropped into vials containing  alcohol, brandy, rum, whiskey, or any other spirit, without further  trouble, and corked up. These should be packed in a small box.  The Smithsonian Institution is making a special study of entomo-  logy, and all contributions of the kind transmitted to it at Washing-  ton from any part of this country will meet with attention and ac-  knowledgment. It is not out of the way to assert that the generosity  of the donors will redound greatly to their credit, to the cause of liberal  science, and to a more perfect knowledge of this most celebrated of all  insects.  Such a collection being concentrated at one point will wonderfully  facilitate exact analysis, and cause to be distributed throughout the  world copies of faithful engravings of the different species of the  locusta, which can nowhere now be found in the annals of science.   214 MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GEASSHOPPEK.   ON TEE MEANS OF DESTEOYINO THE GRASSHOPPER.   BY V. MOTSCHULSKY.   Translated from the Eussian by Professor \\Vm. W. Turner.  The tendency to an equilibrium in all things is a law of nature, and  accordingly this law holds good in regard to the locusts.* Whole gene-  rations of them succumb to the climatic influences of those countries to  which, impelled by hunger, they betake themselves. Winds and storms  not unfrequently cast vast swarms of them into lakes and seas, and other  millions perish in crossing rivers. Frogs, lizards, and various birds,  especially of the starling, blackbird, lark, crow, jackdaw, stork, and  other species, devour them with great avidity. Among these is the  so-called rose-colored starling, {Gracula rosea, L.,) of a shiny black  color, with a whitish red back and breast, resembling at a distance our  black starling with the coat of a magpie. It breeds in great flocks in  southeastern Russia, especially about Orenburg, and throughout Asia  Minor, where it is known by the appellation oi samarmog or semermer.  As soon as it perceives at a distance a flight of locusts, it immediately  pursues them ; and in the evening,, when the latter alight on the  ground, the destroying and devouring begin without loss of time, and  continue as long as any remain. According to the popular tradition  of the Asiatics, these birds are said to abound about St. James's  Well,t on Mount Ararat, and always to follow its water. Accordingly  in Georgia and in Asia Minor, particularly in Damascus, Aleppo, and  Mosul, speculators sell water from the above mentioned well to be  used lor alluring the samarmog when the locusts make their appear-  ance. But the inhabitants of those countries now place no great faith  in this sympathetic means, but rely in preference on other modes of  destruction. In the south ot France, according to the testimony of the  learned Solier, the common European blackbird (Turdus merula, L.)  takes the place of our rose-colored starling, and produces great devas-  tation among the Italian locusts. In Africa, and especially in the Isle  of France, there is found still a third species of starling, {Gracula gryl-  livora, Daud.,) a cinnamon-colored bird with a blackish head and  white belly, which likewise pursues and destroys the locust. In all  the places where the birds show themselves thus useful to the inhabit-  ants, to shoot and catch them is regarded as a crime. In ancient  Egypt, the ibis was counted sacred, because it destroyed quantities of  reptiles and injurious insects, especially locusts. In the south of  France one of the birds that destroys the locust is known by the name  â– â– - The term \" locust \" tised in this article is applied to what is called in this country, the  grasshopper. The '^cicada,\" or locust of America, is an entirely different insect.  â– f- The well and the monastery situated near it were buried in the year 18-10 by an  earthquake.

It appears to be our stork. la the Neapolitan dominions,  the landholders on the appearance of the locust place their chief reli-  ance on the birds. In Asia Minor and other southern regions, the  locusts make their appearance so frequently and in such vast quanti-  ties, that the birds alone cannot meet the requirements of the inhabi-  tants. In North America, the young turkeys are trained to seek out  and feed upon the larvte of grasshoppers and locusts, especially when  they begin to hatch from the eggs, whereby great numbers of them  are destroyed.  Domestic fowls, as geese, ducks, turkeys, and chickens, are exceed-  ingly fond of such food. About Temeshvar, in Hungary, the locusts  were once got rid of by driving into tlie place where they had alighted  15,000 head of swine, which in a single night and morning devoured  them all.  Of insects, the one called the tormenting ichneumon, (Pirnpla insli-  gatoi\\) of the order Hymenoptera, deposits its eggs in the egg-cases or  tubes of the locust ; and when the larva comes forth, it sucks out the  whole fifty eggs there congregated, so that the case remains empty.  This insect, which is also beneficial to forests, by destroying the cater-  pillars that injure the trees, has a body of a black color with reddish  yellow legs. It has four wings, all of which are transparent and  veined. ' Antennre long. The hinder part of the body is broad, but  grows narrower towards the thorax as in the wasp. The female has  at the end of her body a long tube and a fork. With the former she  lays her eggs, and on the latter she leans when it is necessary to pierce  a place in which to lay an egg. The larva of this insect h white, par-  tially transparent, without legs, and resembles in appearance a small  worm ; when full grown it is about four lines long, and in its narrow  head are tlie scarcely observable parts of its mouth.  Another insect of the tribe of Braconidte, called the short-winged  ichneumon, {Froctotrupes brevipennis, Latr.,) has often been found by  me near the Italian locusts, on which were traces of bites upon the  sides of the thorax and abdomen. Hence I suppose that this insect  also stands in some sort of connexion with the locusts, aiding, it may  be, in the diminution of the latter. But I have not succeeded in de-  tecting it operating in this manner.  In America a species of mud-wasp attacks the young brood of the  locust, and carries them to its nest to nourish its larvfe there. At  the same time this strange phenomenon is observed, that the wasp  previously seizes the insect which it requires, stings it, and tlius pro-  duces a paralyzed condition ; so that, without dying, it remains in a  motionless state, and as it does not putrefy in the wasp's nest, it can  serve for food during the whole growth of the larva.  Taking into consideration the means provided by nature for restrain-  ing the multiplication of the locust within the requisite limits, we may  assume that, of the eggs laid by it about one-tenth succeed in passing  through all the transformations of their existence, and with this tenth  part alone it comes in conflict with the husbandman. But even this  is sufficiently great to furnish matter for reflection to every one who  knows by experience wliat an attack of the locust is. The most   216 MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER.  illustrious nations in the world have not disdained to devote their time  and means to the destruction of this pernicious insect.  In the Acropolis at Athens there stood a brazen statue of Apollo  Parnopius, who had driven the locust out of Attica ; but in what way,  the historian Pausanias could not learn. In other parts of Greece  Hercules was adored for the same reason. Pliny asserts that in Rome,  on account of the devastations of the locusts, recourse vras had to the  Sybiliine books. In Syria and Chaldea, the locust was dreaded only  about the end of the montli of June ; because, fearing as was supposed  the constellation of the Pleiades, it did not venture to appear until the  latter had set.  In some parts of Italy the inhabitants hid themselves in their houses  when the locusts appeared, under the notion that they do injury only  when attention is directed to them or when an attempt is made to  drive them away. In Palestine and Mesopotamia, on the contrary,  every one went out to meet a flight of locusts when it came in sight,  and endeavored to drive them away vyith smoke from burning piles of  wood, with beating of sticks and rods upon the ground and in metal  kettles, with a noise of great musical instruments, shouting ^eracZ/  jerdd!* and such like expedients. In Arabia and Egypt, they also  endeavored to frighten the locusts with cries of samarmog ! samarmog!  the name of their terrible enemy the rose-colored starling, at the same  time throwing sand towards the locusts, cursing, spitting, and work-  ing themselves into a fury, believing the insect to be exceedingly  timorous, selfish, cunning, and possessed of Heaven knows what other  qualities.  That the locust is timid, is a fact known long ago. Stoikovitsh  informs us that some locusts once alighted in a tield of ripe grain.  The reapers immediately rushed forth, and began to sharpen their  scythes, in order to reap the millet. The locusts, frightened at the  noise, ascended the stalks, looking about to see what was the matter,  and when the reaping began, they flew away.  In Austrian Galicia, in the year 1828, on the first receipt of the  news that the locusts were moving from the direction of Odessa towards  the frontier, the inhabitants hastened to harvest the grain wherever it  was possible. As soon as the insects appeared, the people met them  with shouting, noises, and the firing of guns and pistols ; and they  actually succeeded in driving them off towards the west. An hour  afterwards, another flight appeared more considerable than the first ;  and, disregarding all the noise of the assembled villagers, they began  to alight. Everything fell into confusion, and each one hied him to his  own tield or kitchen garden, so that the noise was diminished. Never-  theless, this flight also was driven into the woods. But an hour later,  the enemy's main army made its appearance, and unsparingly seized  upon the whole country for forty miles in circumference. The insects  were so ravenous, that in a quarter of an hour each one devoured  from eight to ten ears ; and so numerous, that, in the neighboring  ** The Arabic name of the locust.   MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER. 217  small town of Konincha, about 29,000 bushels of them were buried  in the ground without any perceptible diminution.*  At the time of the flight of the locusts through the passes of the  Bukovina, in the year 1780, an attempt was made to destroy them by  discharges of cannon. The flight was indeed dispersed in places ;  but, dividing into several small portions, the whole flew across the  Dniester, and some of them alighted on fields in Podolia.  The driving away of locusts on the wing with noises and cries not  only does not always answer expectation, f but through the hope of  success it renders the people careless. It is also injurious in this  respect, that if it saves one cultivator it infallibly exposes his neigh-  bor to loss. Hence people living along the coast endeavor to drive the  locusts into a sea or lake ; but even this rarely succeeds. Sometimes  after they have been driven into a wood, it has been set on fire ; whereby  greater loss has been occasioned than by the insects themselves. But  in these instances the people's dread was so great, that they seemed  to imagine that, by extirpating the locust, they would annihilate some  sort of evil spirit, hobgoblin, or destructive monster.  Confounding almost everywhere the means of destroying the footed  locust with those of defence against the attacks of the winged insect,  cultivators commonly complain of the inefficacy of the measures  adopted. For this others have been to blame aa well as themselves.  In Morocco, where people have been acquainted with locusts and  subjected to their ravages at some part of the year time out of mind,  it has long been known as a peculiarity of the footed insect to keep  advancing in a certain direction. Accordingly, they endeavor to stop  its progress by intersecting its line of march Avith wet or dry trenches,  filled with combustible materials, into v/hich the insects are driven.  These ditches often serve as aqueducts for inundating their rice-fields.  This mode is also known in Algiers and throughout Europe. But as  the trenches are in general laid out irregularly, and there is neither  time nor means for making them so deep and wide that the locusts  cannot leap across them, or climb or swim out, the object is rarely  attained. Usually the locusts swim across the water by thousands ;  and where fire is spread about, in consequence of the great quantity of  locusts that are swept down and driven together, it is extinguished,  and the insects crawl away.  Others drive into places occupied by the locusts troops of horses,  flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, that they may trample down their  uninvited guests. But the locust is nimble ; and even were it not so,  horses and other beasts trample upon and crush them with reluctance.  Landowners, not taking into consideration that the locusts are hardly  ever destroyed by such means, and that the men and cattle tread down  scarcely less grain than the insects would consume, constantly have  recourse to this practice. They do not reflect that, by burning up the  * This labor was entirely superfluous ; because if the locusts are killed ami put into a  bag, they cannot ilo any further injury; and by burying them in the ground, like infected  garments, we only lose an excellent material for enriching the soil.  t It is known that neither such noises nor the firing of cannon, nor any other power  whatever, is able either to stop or drive away large bodies of locusts.   218 MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER.  â€¢winged insects, for instance, the evil is by no means done away with,  hut is renewed in a great measure the succeeding year. The locusts,  too, are consumed with a great waste of time, labor, and combusti-  ble material ; whereas they would necessarily die in a few days, and,  by copiously manuring the fields laid waste, would in a measure com-  pensate proprietors for the damage they had sustained.  In the province of New Russia the destruction of locusts, in the  year 1855, was effected, according to the testimony of Col. Tshern-  javski, in the following manner :  In the district of Leoff a commencement was made on the 20th of  May,* by digging around the young locusts small trenches connected  with the river Prutli. Having partitioned off a space of some 5,400  acres, all the grass was mowed off, and the locusts burnt up with it.  Besides this, both morning and evening,, in other places where the  locusts had accumulated in the greatest numbers, they were trampled  down in different circles by troops of horses. f This was done by a  draft on the five jurisdictions or townships, consisting of about 705  laboring men per day, who relieved each other for seven days. The  Bulgarian colonies also furnished 300 Bulgarians, who worked at ex-  cavating the ditches. This activity continued for just thirty days,  till the locusts were all destroyed. In destroying the locusts in the  LeofF district the inhabitants consequently expended 22,950 days' labor.  In the Bulgarian colonies the same means were used, only with this  difference : that, for the more convenient passage of the locusts to the  excavated trenches, cross-paths were cleared in the grass with spades  and pick-axes. On account of the deficiency of combustible materials,  more locusts were crushed here than burnt. This cost the Bulgarian  colonies 23,000 days' labor.  In the Tatarbunar jurisdiction of Akkerman district the footed  locusts were mostly crushed out with brooms, in which were expended  20,000 days' labor.  In the Olonesh jurisdiction of the same district about 6,000 days'  labor was spent in the same way for this purpose.  In the Bender district, in the government of Izmail, and in the  German colonies, the same measures were adopted ; but the number of  laborers is not known. Col. Tsherujavski assumes approximately that,  in all these places, more than 80,000 men were employed, to say nothing  of the droves of horses and the various vehicles. All this, being done  in the height of the working season, had the effect of retarding and  diminishing the sowing of spring grains and the making of hay, be-  sides causing the neglect of other farm labors and the accumulation  of arrearages to government. Furthermore, although by means of  this costly labor a considerable part of the locusts were destroyed, and  the hope of saving the remaining grain was for a while indulged in,  yet the event turned out quite otherwise. The locusts left behind in  various places, having acquired wings, spread themselves over all the  fields in such multitudes, that their former diminution, which seemed  Â« Evidently too late, as the locusts were already sufficiently strong and lively to escape  from the danger.  I An exceedingly inefficacious means.   MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER. 219  60 enormous while tlieir destruction was going on, became quite  imperceptible. Each day they alighted on new places, and everywhere  produced devastation. Consequently all the labors described were only  so much money thrown away, in addition to the losses suffered directly  from the locusts, which had then destroyed not less than half of all the  grain sown.  If we assume the same ratio for the number of laborers who turned  out to destroy the locusts through the whole province of Bessarabia,  in the Kherson, and other governments to which the insect migrated,  we may boldly assert that more than a hundred thousand working  days of the best farming season were spent in destroying them without  success.* An immense amount of money was thus completely wasted.  Meanwhile the dread of the locusts was not put an end to. From  information collected in the places themselves, it appears that they  left their eggs behind them over an extent of 14,4 2G desjatins, or  nearly 39,000 acres. Calculating a single egg-sac for every square  sazhen, (49 square feet,) we obtain 34,622,400 sacs; and at the rate of  50 eggs to a sac, the whole will amount to 1,731,000,000 of eggs.  If a locust during its life time, {. c, in the course of 100 days, will  require, on an average^ for its support twelve drachms of common grass  per day, then the consumption of these insects for the whole of their  existence will not be less than 228,000,000 poods, or 3,075,787 tons.  Estimating the value of a pood of grass at one silver kopek, (three-  fourths of a cent,) the whole loss sustained by the ravages of locusts  in Bessarabia in the year 1835 will amount to at least 2,280,000 silver  rubles, or $1,710,000. It should likewise be observed that in making  these estimates the very smallest measures are taken, and that grain  is reckoned at the same value as grass. After this, it will certainly  not appear strange that the locust should be considered a destructive  insect.  Some have thought to free their fields from locusts by watering them  with lime-water or lye. But is it practicable to carry this out to any  great extent, and will the fluid fall on the locusts' eggs, especially  when they are covered with a coating of earth? In Slavonia, at the  close of the last century, for the purpose of destroying the footed  locust, which was already crawling about, they made use of wooden  harrows loaded with weights, which were dragged about the fields as  in harrowing grain. Some of them went obliquely, one after the other,  beginning with a large circle; each succeeding time they described  smaller circles; and in this manner, advancing in a spiral, they grad-  ually approached the centre. But as the harrow went slowly and  could follow only the prescribed course, the locusts easily leaped aside,  and the entire proceeding was almost fruitless.  It has been proposed to surround the fields with cords and rods  smeared over with tar, to which the locust has a great repugnance.  Yet it is scarcely possible to carry this plan into execution, except for  very small enclosures.  Lastly, for the purpose of driving the insects away, long ropes have  â– ~\" And this, too, because, from want of a knowledge of the habits of the insect, its destruc-  tion was commenced too lute and without a previous examination of the locality.   220 MEANS OF DESTEOYING THE GRASSHOPPER.  been used. These were drawn along the ground, as low as possible,  by two men having hold one of each end, who at the same time made  a noise by bawling and beating, thus endeavoring to drive them into  trenches dug across, or to a linen cloth stretched out upon the ground  and drawn up to a ridge, where they were trampled upon or crushed  with rollers, or burnt up along with the grass.  Instead of these absurd, unreasonable, and inefficacious means of  attacking the locust, we find that, in remote antiquity, the wisest pre-  cautions were adopted.  On the island of Lemnos, in Grreece, it was ordained that, on the  appearance of the locusts, each inhabitant should furnish a certain  measure of them to the rural police; and among the Cyrenians it was  considered obligatory upon every one to take part, three times a year,  in the general destruction of these insects, first, in tramplinp' down  the eggs, next in destroying the young larvas, and lastly in killing the  adult locusts. A neglect to obey this ordinance subjected the indi-  vidual to general contempt, and was punished as disobedience to the  laws.  In China it has been the rule from the earliest times to ]ublish  yearly, in the Pekin Gazette, the edict of Bogdy-Khan, that all  the rural authorities should attend betimes to the destruction of the  locusts in order to prevent their becoming a public scourge. The  governors of provinces are consequently obliged, in all places situated  near the coast,* to assemble the people early in the spring, and dis-  tribute them in parties about the known nests of the larvaa of the  locust, and see that the destruction of these larv?e is efi'ected in good  season, speedily, and in the regular manner. They also distribute to  the laborers the established compensation for their work.  In the time of the Eastern Roman Empire, the whole population  was wont to hasten forth to the destruction of the locusts. Kerchiefs  and sheets were spread out upon the ground under the bushes and  trees, and upon these the insects were driven and shaken down. These  cloths were then rolled up and twisted hard. In other places they  used sacks, into which the locusts were thrown and crashed under foot.  At the close of the hunt the whole gathering was weighed, and the  Greek patriarch distributed for it a fixed payment. Such a regulation  exists to the present day in many parts of Turkey, where, on the ap-  pearance of the locusts, the local authorities, for the purpose of  destroying them, drive forth the peasants armed with brooms and  shovels, especially the so-called rayas, or Christian population, who,  however, find it difficult to obta,in the established reward of four parotsh-  kas the oka.f Some years ago, in a single morning, as many as 8,000,  \"\"^ It is the common belief of the Chhiese, that the locust is engendered in the littoral  provinces, by means of the sun's rays, from putrefying fish-roes remaining along the shore  after a haul. This absurd theory probably originated in the fact that on the sea-  shore, and about brackish waters in general, great quantities of dead locusts are heaped up,  which perisli there by reason that, in leaping about the brackish soil, the insects sink into it  and the salt sticks to their legs, leaving them unable to free themselves and escape ; the  next advancing tide drowns them, and casts them up on the shore. The locust is also  especially fond of laying its eggs in sandy places overgrown with reeds, where consequently  they are hatched.  f An oka is about 2| jxÂ»unds.   MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER. 221  and in the course of the spring as many as 80,000 okas of the young  larv'j\\3 were collected in tliis manner.  In France, when the locusts make their appearance, every one turns  out that can â€” men women, and children, and with whatever is at  hand. From the earliest times, hy a regulation of the government, a  common price has heen paid for the locusts collected and also for their  eggs. The collected eggs are either huried in the ground or thrown into  the rivers,* About Aries, Rte, Marie, St. Jerome, and other ]mrts of  Provence, women and children are mostly employed in collecting the  eggs; and as the locust breeds there perpetually, its destruction is a  task constantly devolving upon the inhabitants.  In Italy likewise a price is paid for collecting locusts, and once,  in the neighborhood of Milan, the rural police received not less than  12,000 sacks of them, which had been gathered in the course of a few  days.  In Hungary, not only all the people turn out to the locust hunt,  but even the domestic animals and fowls join eagerly in the pursuit ;  and for what is collected a reward is paid by the government. The  same is the case in Spain, where, in the year 1780, about Zamora,  in addition to the peasantr}', the troops were employed in destroying  the locusts. They were stationed around the young locusts just  hatched, and with long brooms swept them into common heaps, around  which fires were kindled. Three thousand men were employed by  turns in this work for three weeks, and they succeeded in collecting  about 18,000 bushels of locusts, so that each man in twenty-one days  caught about six bushels, or a little over nine quarts a day.f  With us in Russia, it was decreed by an imperial ukaz of tlie l7th  of July, 1802, that a sum equal to about a cent a pint should be paid  for locusts' eggs collected in Little Russia ; afterwards the price was  raised to ten cents. On the appearance of the locusts in the i)rovince  of New Russia in the year 1823, the chief local government appro-  priated the sum of $75,000 ; but the amount of private expenditure  on this account was not ascertained.  In France, at the present time, a reward of half a franc is paid for  a kilogram of the eggs, and a quarter of a I'ranc for the same weight  of insects.! It is known that in the year 1613 the city of Aries ex-  pended the sum of 25,000 francs for collecting 134,000 kilograms  (about 295,000 pounds) of eggs and insects. The city of Marseilles  spent 20,000 francs in this way in the same year, 5,542 francs in 1824,  and 6,200 francs in 1825. In the year 1832, in Ste, Marie alone, 61  laborers collected 1,979 kilograms of locusts' eggs ; and in 1833 they  gathered 3,908 kilograms ; so that one person collected not over 63  kilograms in the course of three months.

Fig. 1.    In order to increase the amount collected and to facilitate the opera-  tion, various auxiliary devices have been contrived and put into  practice.  It is the custom with us in Southern Kussia to gather both the footed  and the winged locusts at night with the aid of a sieve, and to throw  them into sacks, where they are crushed by trampling upon them or  by pounding them with beetles.  In the south of France they use for this purpose a breadth of cloth.  which is held at the corners so as to  form an inclined plane. By running  the cloth rapidly along the grass or  grain, the locusts are made to jump  or fall upon the cloth, from which  they are shaken off into sacks, and  then crushed. In this manner, ac-  cording to Solier, from four to six  ^^^^K kilograms of locusts may be cap-  ' tured in a day.  In July, 1826, one Arnold Thompson, of New Hampshire, succeeded  in catching, in a single evening, between the hours of eight and  twelve^ five bushels and three pecks of locusts. The. contrivance  used by him was the followinsr : Havino; attached to2;ether two sheets,  he formed of them a sort of bag, which was fastened to a cross-pole,  to permit the locusts to enter into the bag, and so that two men could  take hold of the two ends of the pole and draw it rapidly along the  pjâ€ž_2. grain. From these two ends also  two braces extended to the back  knot of the sack, in order that the  hinder end of the apparatus might  be held as high as possible above  the ground, so as not to break  down the grain with the knot.  With this apparatus the fields  were swept over in the evening,  whejithelocicsts arepet^ched quietly  upon the grain, in such manner  that the striking of the ears  against the edge of the sheet  % ;/ \"^-- ^ shook off the locusts into the bag.  ''^^ ''''''''â–  â–  Bulging out with the pressure of  \" \"^;^::::2sÂ£il=iS^=^ tho air, it would not suffer the  insects to escape, but all passed on towards the knot. After moving  the drag rapidly a dozen rods, the braces were taken out, and the  sheets doubled over ; the knot was then put into a common sack,  and untied, and the locusts poured out. The emptied bag was again  tied up, and the catching proceeded. The locusts in the sack were  destroyed by plunging it into boiling water.  In the year 1824 we employed in the Crimea a still more convenient  apparatus. To the mouth of a sack three feet and a half in length     MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER.   223    Fig. 4.     X^.     was attached a hoop of an elliptical shape. To the two opposite edges  of the hoop, at the place of the  greatest curve, cords were fast-  ened. Grown persons or children,  by taking hold of the cords, drag-  ged the sack along as rapidly  as possible, almost touching the  ground. The locusts that fell  in were trampled on with the  feet. The dead insects were then  thrown out and tbe catching  recommenced.  A still better apparatus, em-  ployed with great success in  the south of France, consists  of a sack growing narrower  towards the bottom and fas-  tened to a pole in the manner i  employed by entomologists, f  According to Solier, an ordi- ;  nary boy with this contri-;  vance will catch not less than ',  50 kilograms, which is at  least ten times as much as by  any of the preceding meth-  ods.* This hunt for the wingless locusts is undertaken in May or June.  The American writer, Harris, recommends that all the grass and  grain should be mowed in those months in which the young locusts  make their appearance, thus destroying them by hunger ; inasmuch  as at that time they are feeble and unable to migrate far in search of food.  Besides, they lose the power of sheltering themselves from the weather,  and soon perish from cold and storms.  All the methods described are of incontestable utility, and have  often proved so in practice. But unfortunately they are not always  carried out with the necessary exactness, at the proper time, and  under the circumstances indicated. By reason of the carelessness  which seems inherent in so many people, they undertake the destruc-  tion of the locusts Avhen they are already, so to speak, at the husband-  man's door. No one observes or wishes to observe the place where  the locusts lay their eggs in the spring, or the time of their hatching,  because then tliey do no injury. They do not know or care to know  how the insects are developed, when they begin their march, or when  their flight takes place. Having thus allowed the locusts quietly to  breed arid develop, they employ too late and without discrimination  the above described means, which accordingly prove inefficacious.  In the Appendix to Vol. XIII of the Collection of the Civil Laws  of Russia, very useful rules and precepts are given for the destruction  of locusts; but few know how to apply them.  * All these methods are efficacious, if skillful arrangements are made for them; but the  places in which this mode of capture is practised are more or less trampled dowu by the  laborers.   224   MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER.   Fig. 5.    For the destruction of the locusts in Bessarabia, in the year 1836,  the following measures were adopted by Col. Tshernjavski, on the  principle that the less the locusts have advanced in their groiuthy the  acsier they can he destroyed:  In the first days when the rye began to shoot into ear, 150 persons,  both grown people and children, were  despatched into the fields belonging  to the villages of Gantshur end Po-  goya, of the Bender district. The  children were furnished with com-  mon zvooden heaters, shaped like those  used by washerwomen^ having a blade  two feet long, five inches wide, and  seven-eighths of an inch thick, with a  curved handle ten inches long, and  so contrived as to strike with the flat side upon the ground or the  locusts. The adults had a sort of shovel with a much longer handle,  three feet in length, so as to be grasped with both hands.  Fig. 6. They found the locusts, as  yet of very small size, in  swarms in the places where  they were hatched. The la-  borers provided with beaters  and shovels were divided,  under the direction of their  superintendent, into parties  of twenty, thirty, or forty in-  dividuals; and having taken  up their positions on the bor-  ders of the space occupied by the locusts, they proceeded from the  various sides to crush them out, approaching gradually towards the  centre, where they thickly accumulated. As the small locusts do not  quit their birth-place, the laborers went three times over the same  locality. Accordingly^ after giving time for those which had escaped  ^''s-'?. to collect into masses, ten  or fifteen laborers destroyed  in the enclosed space the en-  tire brood without leaving  a remnant. In the course of  >two weeks, with the above  mentioned number of 150  laborers, the whole of the  locusts were everywhere de-  stroyed.  In the district of Olanesh,  in the year 1837, forty per-  sons were employed in the  same way; and in the course  of five days, viz : from the  1st to the 5th of June, the whole brood of locusts were extirpated for  the space of nearly three-quartera of a mile, and over seven bushels    \\^^    MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER. 225  of insects were collected. In a single hour six youths crushed more  than a troop of 200 horses could have done ; which could not have  \"been accomplished by three hundred men with brooms after the  locusts had attained their growth. A bushel of these small locusts  contained so large a number of them, that three weeks later they  would have made over a hundred bushels. And for this there was  required neither carts and teams, nor troops of horses, nor bush-  beaters. Accordingly, for the destruction of the locusts in the Olanesh.  district in the year 1837, there were expended 200 days of labor, that  is to say, twenty times less than in the year 1835; and the success ivas  complete, for the inhabitants of these localities affirm that of the  locusts of 1837 not one reached the winged state.  From what precedes we are led to the following general conclusions :  1. It is necessary to observe in the autumn,* esjjecially after a hot  summer, where the locusts have deposited their eggs, and to accustom  persons appointed for the purpose so to do, especially youths and young  children, who else would idly run about the fields and meadows.  2. As soon as the labors of tillage will permit, people should be  sent out in the fall to collect the locusts' eggs, provided with sharp  sticks or hoes for turning up the ground. If the eggs are deposited  in the fields or in sandy places where ploughs and harrows can pass,  these latter should be made use of. The egg-tubes of the locusts  should be poured into sacks, and then measured or weighed, and a  suitable reward paid for the amount collected^ so as to stimulate the  work-people, and especially, the children, to busy themselves in this  useful labor.  3. All the places where locusts' eggs are found should be ploughed  over, if possible, two or three times very late in the autumn, selecting  for this purpose rainy and dull days, because the eggs thus turned up  and exposed are destroyed by the wet or by the birds of passage which  then make their appearance. Special attention should also be given  to bare spots in the fields^, where not unfrequently great quantities of  egg-tubes remain unobserved.  4. If, after a hot summer, the fall and winter are equable, it will  be necessary to repeat in the spring the search for the brood hatched  from the eggs that have survived the winter ; because this sort of  weather is uncommonly favorable to the complete and uninterrupted  development of the insect.  5.

The  crushing shovels may also have a straight handle made movable in a  vertical plane, it being fastened to the blade by means of a piece of  leather, Vv^hich is nailed on to the blade and is bound to the lower end  of the handle by a cord. The blade should be so fastened to the  handle, that when one takes hold of the latter with both hands, the  whole lower surface of the blade can readily be brought flat down  upon the ground.  These shovels may be made in the shape of fly-flaps, such as were  used in former times for killing flies on the walls of apartments, which  consisted of a handle, to the end of which was nailed a small piece of  pretty stout leather. In our shovels the leather of the fly-flaps is  replaced by a board or blade. Such an implement has this advantage,  that the handle, in consequence of its mobility, can be bent vertically,  and the man standing over the blade can crush the young locusts  with his whole weight. It will not be difficult for people sent out in  this way to crush out the whole brood of locusts without leaving any  behind, and that in a short time.  7. A few days afterwards people should be despatched again to the  places where the locusts were, in order to ascertain whether any of the  brood remain uncrushed; and if they have actually escaped destruction  and have begun to crawl about, or have set out on their march, it  will be necessary to drive out to such places the hogs and domestic  fowls, as turkeys, geese, ducks, chickens, &c. Children, also, with  bags attached to a hoop and fixed to the end of a staff, as represented  in fig. 4, can be sent to catch the locusts by sweeping the bags over  the grass and grain as a mower swings his scythe. This, however,  should not always be done in the same direction ; they should be in-  structed, wherever the locusts are found in the greatest numbers, to  sweep alternately to the right and left. Having made about ten  sweeps, let them turn the ring over, so as to close the bag and prevent  the locusts that have fallen into  it from escaping. These are to  he emptied into larger bags or  sacks, and then crushed by  pounding with pestles, as shown  in fig. 8. The children should  be rewarded by a payment in  money for a successful catch.  By repeating this sort of hunt  a,fter the footed locusts one, two,  or more days, according to their  growth, number, and greedi-  ness, the grass trodden down by  the children has time to recover,  and in a short time the insects  are all caught, notwithstanding  their almost infinite numbers. It should also be observed that breed-   Fig. 8.    MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER. 227  ing large quantities of domestic fowls, and especially training them  betimes to feed on .young locusts in the places where the latter are  often found, is exceedingly advantageous to the husbandman. The  training of goslings, chickens^ and young turkeys to feed on young  locusts is to be effected not at once, but gradually, by the poultry-  keeper, who should present at first one or two locusts in the crumbled  food of the young fowl, and increase the quantity by degrees by the  addition of living as well as dead insects. The breeding of largo  numbers of Guinea-fowl, (Numida meleagris,) which multiply rapidly  in the steppe cantons of the Caucasus, would have the effect of di-  minishing the swarms of locusts; since this bird is all its life constantly  running to and fro, and would vigorously pursue the insects.  8. All the locusts which are thus collected and killed or crushed  can be profitably employed in manuring flower or kitchen gardens and  fields; for after they are crushed they cannot breed or do any further  injury, and they constitute an excellent fertilizer.  9. W the locusts have already nearly reached their full growth, and  the inhabitants and proprietors in their vicinity have not taken notice,  of the fact^ it will be necessary to Avatch them witli double vigilance;^  in order to surprise tliem in the act of* assuming the winged form, at  which time they are uncommonly feeble and sluggish. It will then  be found very advantageous to drive out troops of horses, all the  horned cattle, and the swine, into the places where these tender and  pale-colored insects are to be found, for the purpose of trampling them  down.  10. If the insects should fly to a distance, and settle anywhere in sr  thick mass, it would be well Fig. 9.  to send out people to the spot |.,  in the evening with heavy  rollers, made of timber, fixed  on iron or wooden axles and  drawn by horses or oxen.  They should be made suf-  ficiently heavy, of logs nine  or ten inches in diameter, ' _:=g=^^5g^_. j^sf*  and about seven feet long. ^,^-â€ž;^a^s^^gs^k^,:^ ^,^,^^-â€ž,^â€ž,â€ž ^ -  The locusts, wearied with flying about, and having eaten their fill by  the evening, sit at night, and especially towards morning till sunrise,  quietly and closely ; so that the roller when drawn amoDg them  crushes multitudes, and thus one's neighbors' fields, if not one's own,  are preserved. By not permitting the locusts to lay their eggs, the  proprietor can indulge the hope that in the following year liis crops  will escape. I regard the providing of these rollers \"in districts in-  fested by the locusts as a public necessity, as in some cases tliey can  also be usefully employed against the so called earth-worm.  11. Besides the rollers, the use of bags fixed on hoops, as in fig. 4  or 3, will be found advantageous, according to whether the grass and  grains are to be preserved or whether they may be trodden down, which  again will depend upon their degree of ripeness. The hunt should  be commenced at sunrise and continued until the morning dew is dried  up, after which the locusts become too brisk in their movements.   228 MEANS OF DESTROYING THE GRASSHOPPER.  12. It is necessary to exercise caution in driving out these insects  from grass or tilled fields when the grain is already green but not  ripe; because such places, even after being visited by the locusts, are  sometimes able to recover and to furnish some sort of a crop. But  when they pass over fields of corn after the grain is more or less  ripened, there is no means of saving it.  13. No one can be prohibited from driving away the locusts from  his field; but it should no less be the duty of the elders of the villages  to see that the expulsion of the insects is performed by the united  efforts of the community, and not to the injury of any one proprietor.  But to observe this is very difficult, and the scaring away of the insects  is only permissible where there are large uncultivated wastes or forests,  lakes or seas, to which the swarms of locusts can be driven.  14. As we have useful institutions for securing against losses from  fire, from hail, from shipwreck, and the like, it might not be without  advantage to have a means of insurance against locusts, in the shape  of municipal rnoneyed corporations and hanldng institutions, established  in the principal cities of those portions of Russia which are subjected  to their ravages. Each inhabitant of the region indicated might make  a very small annual payment, and in this manner a capital would be  accumulated sufficient to indemnify those who have suffered loss, and  to recompense such as have distinguished themselves in collecting and  destroying this pernicious insect. Supposing, for example, that the  region of southern Russia which is subjected to the visits of the locusts  has twenty millions of inhabitants, and that each paid into the trea-  sury of the insurance office only one cent a year; this, for the first year,  would give |200,000, and in ten years, together with the interest,  -would amount to over three million dollars. The payment to sufferers  by way of indemnification should be in proportion to the frequency  with which the locusts made their appearance in a place, and to the  amount of damage occasioned by them.  15. It may therefore be said, in conclusion, that the most effective  and at the same time the easiest mode of opposing the development of  the locusts is the crushing out of the young broods when collected in  swarms in the place where they were hatched. Consequently the most  important thing is to know the nesting-place of these destructive  pests. In order to discover them and to point out the course to be  pursued by the inhabitants of the villages in their vicinity, it might  be well, in the first place, to send skillful persons to these localities to  imake the necessary researches ; and these, with the assistance of the  local elders, might seek out the places where the insects abound, and  establish the necessary regulations for their destruction.   VEGETABLE COLONIZATION. 229   VEGETABLE COLONIZATION OF THE BRITISH ISLES, OF  SHETLAND, FAROE AND ICELAND.   BY CH. MARTINS.   [Translated for the Smithsonian Report from the ' 'Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelless.' '  Geneva, June, 1848. ]  Whether each plant be a native of the place where it is actually  reproduced, or whether, there have existed centres of creation from  which vegetables have been progressively distributed over the surface  of the earth, are questions which seem likely to divide, for some time  to come, the opinions of naturalists. But while those who suppose  the plant to have originated in the locality where we find it treat the  problem somewhat vaguely, those, on the contrary, who admit the  fact of vast vegetable migrations, similar to those of the races of man-  kind, and who apply to these questions the ideas furnished by geology  respecting the past, and by terrestrial physics and meteorology re-  specting the present condition of the globe, are not content to see in  the geographic distribution of species a fact without premises and  without consequences. They seek to discern therein the trace of the  later revolutions of our planet, and the action of those numerous and  varied forces which still continue to impede or promote the dissemina-  tion of plants. They strive to trace upon the map the march of those  vegetable hosts which have overrun certain countries, leaving others  to retain their primitive flora. Such studies date from yesterday;  but reflective minds will scarcely fail to presage their importance.  In effect, the creation of existing vegetables has followed close upon  the emergence of continents and islands, being in some sort the last  act of the geologic history of our globe. Still later, man makes his  appearance and tradition commences.  Botanists have long remarked that certain islands have a flora  peculiar to themselves,, while others afford no plant which does not  equally appear on the nearest continent. The British islands are of  this class ; but we shall not limit our consideration to England, Scot-  land and Ireland, we shall attempt to follow the vegetable migration  through that archipelago of larger and smaller islands, which, under  the names of Orkneys, Shetland, Faroe, and Iceland, form the only  chain which connects middle Europe with northern America.  Turning our attention first to the botanical geography of the British  isles, we have for our guide the ingenious labors of Mr. Hewett Wat-  son* and Mr. Edward Forbes. f Both have carefully explored their  \"â–  Remarks on the geographical distribution of British plants in connexion with latitude, elevation,  and climale, 1 vol., 8vo. , 1835 ; and Cybele Britannica, vol. 1, 1847.  fOn the connexion between the distribution of the existing fauna and flora of the  British isles and the geological changes which have affected their area, especially during  the epoch of the northern drift. â€” {^Memoirs of the geological survey of Great Britain, vol. 1,  p. 336.   230 VEGETABLE COLONIZATION.  country ; the former as a botanist, the latter as a zoologist and geolo-  gist. One important, indeed capital, fact gives the result at which  they have arrived, namely, that the British isles present not a single  plant exclusively their own, and which, with one sole excej^tion, is  not found likewise in continental Europe. The exception is the  unique species Eriocaulon septangulare, a native of North America,  which has been cast on the shores of the Hebrides. The British isles,  then, cannot be considered a centre of vegetation, since the plants which  inhabit them exist more abundantly on the European continent. But  all have not come from the same regions, and we shall be able to dis-  tinguish with Messrs. Watson and Forbes a series of vegetable migra-  tions which have colonized in succession the islands referred to.  Asturian type. â€” Thanks to the mildness of its winters, Ireland has  preserved for us, so to say, the remains of a peninsular flora. We  find growing wild in the southwest of this island a dozen plants,  natives of the Asturias, which have maintained themselves in Ireland  like the last representatives of a colony whose point of departure is to  be found in the north of Spain. Limited to the western coast, these  plants do not exist in the eastern provinces of the island. Farther  on we shall seek with Mr. Forbes to discriminate the probable causes  of that migration, the most ancient of all, since it supposes a temper-  ature and a distribution of lands and seas very different from those  which exist at present.  Armorican type. â€” The southwest of England and southeast of Ire-  land present a vegetation whose analogy, with that of Brittany and  Normandy, has long attracted the notice of botanists. Many southern  species are to be met with along the western coasts of France, up to  the point where the steadily increasing rigor of the climate arrests  their migration towards the north. A certain number of these plants  find, in the peninsula of which Cherbourg occupies the extremity, so  mild a winter temperature that they maintain their ground in spite  of the heat of the summers. These have afterwards spread themselves  in the southwest of England, along the coasts of Devonshire and  Cornwall^ whence they have gained the opposite shores of Ireland and  have become naturalized in the counties of Cork and Waterford. It  was thus that the Normans formerly passed from the same region,  imder the conduct of William the Conqueror, to invade England.  But the vegetable occupation has never penetrated beyond the south of  the island, and the rigors of the climate which could not arrest the  progress of the men have opposed an insuperable barrier to the inva-  sion of the plants.  Boreal type. â€” The mountains of Scotland, Cumberland, and Wales  offer to the botanist a vegetation entirely special, and different in all  points from that of the plains of England. Analogous to the vegeta-  tion of the Swiss Alps, this flora presents a still more striking resem-  blance to that of the arctic countries, such as Lapland, Iceland, and  Greenland. The greater part of the plants which subsist on the sum-  mits of the high mountains of Scotland vegetate at the level of the  sea in the islands of the Frozen ocean ; but there are many of them  which have never been recognized in the Alps of Switzerland. By  far the greatest number, however, of these vegetables exist at the   VEGETABLE COLONIZATION. 231  same time on the shores of the polar countries and on the snow-  crowned summits of the Alps of central Europe.  Germanic type. â€” It is this which predominates in England, and  constitutes, as we may say, the basis of its vegetation. Natives of  the north of France and of Germany, these plants have occupied the  greater part of England, Scotland, and Ireland, as heretofore the  Saxons invaded the territories of the Angles in order to supplant them.  If it he true that the aboriginal owners of the country disappeared  after the invasion, it is thus, perhaps, that the plants of Germany  have stifled those which formed the primitive vegetation of these  islands. In the course of ages the Germanic type has become so pre-  dominant that most English botanists designate it by the name of the  British type. Nevertheless, a certain number of plants pertaining to  this type have never traversed the strait which separates England  from Ireland, while the rest of the migration transcended this ob-  stacle. Species common on the English coasts of St. George's channel  are unknown on the opposite shores of Ireland. The investigations  of the geologist have confirmed in every respect the inductions de-  rived from botany. Certain animals which occur indiscriminately in  Germany are in the British islands emparked, as it were, and restricted  to the region where the Germanic flora exclusively prevails. Thus  the hare, the squirrel, the dormouse, the marten, the mole, are lim-  ited to England, and do not appear in Ireland. In the latter island  five species alone represent the class of reptiles, while eleven occur  in England, and twenty-two in Belgium, the point of departure for  the Germanic migration. The living molluscs, such as the different  species of Helix and Clausilia, are distributed in like manner.  The maritime fauna and flora obey all the laws which control the  distribution of terrestrial vegetables and animals. Certain kinds of  marine alga) proper to southern climates occur only on the western  coasts of England, where also certain species of fish are caught, which  never pass beyond the straits of Dover and St. George's channel.  These are the neptunian representatives of the Asturian and Armorican  types. In like manner the herring, the cod, the pollack, abound only  in the North sea, along the eastern coast, where the Germanic type is  predominant. Finally, the great Cetacea, such as whales, narwals,  and dolphins of the Arctic seas, seem even in the depths of the ocean  to respect the ideal limit which separates the boreal vegetation of  Scotland and of England from the more southerly floras of Cornwall  and the south of Ireland.  Till the present time naturalists had seen in this distribution of  organized beings, with reference to certain definite regions, but a  natural consequence of the all-powerful influences of climate and of  soil. If some plants of the Asturias maintain themselves in the south  of Ireland, it was thought a sufficient explanation that tlicy find there  the temperate winters of tlie Iberian peninsula, while the moderate  heat of the Irish summer suffices for the ripening of their seed. For  a like reason the plants of Brittany and Normandy have established  themselves in Cornwall and Devonshire, where a climate prevails  analogous to that of their own country. The robust growths of Ger-  many had found in the middle region of England, in the south of   232 VEGETABLE COLONIZATION.  Scotland, and the north of Ireland conditions of existence analogous  to those of the north of Germany and of France, and hence their  multiplication and diffusion through the larger portion of the British  islands. Lastly, the crags, the heathy acclivities, the peat-mosses  and moors of Scotland, afforded to Arctic plants the diversified sta-  tions, the summers without excess of heat, the long vs^inter slumbers,  and the protecting snows of polar regions.  Mr. Edward Forbes could not content himself with these explana-  tions ; he discerned a deeper meaning in the existence of those foreign  types which constitute the fauna and flora of the British islands. To  him they seemed to present vestiges of an order of things which has  passed away ; proofs of the existence of climates warmer or colder  than those now prevailing ; signs of a configuration of land and sea  whose traces lie hidden in the depths of ocean. We may be per-  mitted to follow him in his ingenious and learned researches. Pene-  trating first into this new path, he may, he must have often gone  astray. But with a powerful grasp he re-unites the past and present  of our globe, he summons every realm of nature to the support of his  ideas, and even though he may be mistaken, he will not the less  have contributed to the progress of the natural sciences by com-  mencing the overthrow of that imaginary barrier which scientific  inquirers as well as tradition have reared between the actual state  and the geologic epochs of our planet.  The dozen plants from the Asturias, which inhabit the southwest  of Ireland, are in the eyes of Mr. Forbes the remains of the most  ancient vegetable colony of the British isles. Of all the plants they  now sustain none are more completely strangers to the soil which  bears them. The remoteness of the continental point of departure,  the vast gulf which separates the little colony from its mother coun-  try, the difference of climates, the small number of surviving species,  all announce an ancient origin and an order of things entirely differ-  ent from that now existing. Mr. Forbes, ascending through the  series of geologic formations, transports us to an epoch when the last  tertiary deposits were formed at the bottom of a sea which covered a  great part of the south of Europe and the north of Africa.- The ex-  istence of that sea is proved by the numerous fossil shells of identical  species which are found at a multitude of points from the isles of  Greece to the southern districts of France. Wlien these newly formed  lands lifted themselves above the sea they formed a vast continent,  embracing Spain, Ireland, a part of the north of Africa, the Azores,  and the Canaries.  The upheaving of the bottom of that sea is not a gratuitous hypo-  thesis, since Mr. Forbes has found these same shells in the Taurus, at  the height of 6,000 feet above the level of the Mediterranean. Yet more :  the vast bank of floating algro which extends in a half circle beyond  the Azores from the fifteenth degree to the forty-fifth degree of lati-  tude, Retraces for us, perhaps, the outline of that lost continent. Its  shores have disappeared beneath the sea, but the cincture of marine  plants which girdled it still floats on the surface of the waters.*  Â« This bank is composed of a species of algaj, the Sargassum bacciferum, which appears to  be only a floating variety of the Sargassum vulgare, which is found attached to submarine  rocks bordering the coasts of Europe.   VEGETABLE COLONIZATION. 233  According to Mr. Forbes, the appearance of Armorican plants in  Devonshire, Cornwall, and the southeast of Ireland, connects itself  with the existence of this vanished continent. The southern physi-  ognomy of these vegetables strikes him as indicating a milder climate  than now exists ; yet nothing forbids our considering this migration  as cotemporaneous with the Germanic inroad, if we refer it to the  period when France and England were not yet separated.  The immersion of this great continent was followed by a very dis-  similar era, during which the temperature of the air was lower than  at present. It was during this period, according to Mr. Forbes, that  the migration of Arctic plants, which still cling to the mountains of  Scotland and England, took place. The proofs of a glacial era, imme-  diately preceding our own, abound throughout the north of Europe.  I shall not speak here of the numerous traces of ancient glaciers,  observable in the mountains of England and Ireland, but restrict  myself to arguments drawn from the animal kingdom.*  The larger part of the British Islands is covered with a moveable  deposit formed of transported materials^ which the English geologists  have designated by the name of drift. In two-thirds of England and  Ireland lying towards the north, and throughout Scotland, this drift  contains the remains of animals which are no longer found alive  except in the depths of the Frozen ocean, on the coasts of Iceland and  Greenland. Their enumeration would detain us too long. I shall  content myself with instancing the right whale, the cachelot, (sperm  whale, t) the bala3noptera, the narwal, a fish of the seas of Green-  land, and a large number of shells which are still seen existing in  those latitudes. During this period, then, England was in part  covered by waters whose temperature was similar to that of the frozen  ocean. Not only the plains, but also the lower parts of the moun-  tains, formed the bed or the borders of that ocean ; for in Wales beds  of gravel, sand, and shells, are found at an elevation of 1,476 feet  above the level of the sea. At that epoch England and Scotland,  instead of a continuous territory, presented but a group of large and  small islands. The mountains of Scotland, Cumberland, and Wales,  alone raised themselves above the waves. A climate analogous to that  of Iceland prevailed in this archipelago ; the summits of the mountains  were covered with eternal snows like that of Hecla, and numerous  glaciers descended along the valleys to the borders of the sea. The  plants of Greenland, Iceland, and Norway, borne by the currents or  transported by the floating ice, drifted on these islands, where they  met with a climate but little different from that of their native home.  This transportation of plants by drifting ice is no gratuitous hypo-  thesis. Navigators of the polar seas have often encountered ice fields  loaded with an enormous mass of mingled sand and gravel, on which  plants were vegetating, as on the median moraines of the glaciers of  the Alps, and which being stranded on some distant coast would there  de])osit the plants which afterwards spread themselves in the country.  These Arctic vegetables, Mr. Forbes tells us, have not disappeared  \"' See, on this subject, ' ' Researches on the glacier period and the ancient extension of the  glaciers of Mont Blanc from the Alps to the Jura. â€” {Revue d(s deux Mondes, tome XVII,  p. 919. March, 1847.)  f This species is not conlined to the northern seas. â€” Translalor.   234 VEGETABLE COLONIZATION.  from England. They still exist in the mountains of Cumberland,  Wales, and, above all, of Scotland, where they find a climate analo-  gous to that of their native regions.  At the end of the glacier period the British isles began to rise  slowly from the bosom of the waves. Everywhere we observe on their  acclivities, terraces or lines of ancient coast indicative of intervals of  repose which have interrupted this gradual elevation. To comprehend  properly this phenomenon, it is necessary to figure to one's self, not a  simple upheaval of the shores, the submarine tracts remaining im-  moveable, but a simultaneous movement of both, rising proportionally  above their ancient level. This upheaval it is which has modelled  the existing outline of the British isles and determined the configura-  tion and the depth of the surrounding seas. The depressions have  become less profound and the higher grounds have emerged. Hence  a change in the maritime fauna. The sea being warmer, its shores  have been occupied by the species which now people them. But the  change of temperature being much less sensible at great depths, the  animals of the glacier period have been able to subsist in that situa-  tion. Thus, says Mr. Forbes, in depths where the sounding-line  announces from 525 to 656 feet, the dredge brings up the molluscs of  the Arctic seas, and even a large number of shells which exist in a  fossil state in the drift or deposit of the glacier period which covers  the northern portion of the British isles. From this assemblage of  facts Mr. Forbes concluded that the profounder seas of Britain conceal  populations which have existed there since the glacier era, in like  manner with the plants which crown the summits of the Scottish  Alps.  During the whole of those two geological eras which we have just  been considering England, was united with France. The British  channel and straits of Dover did not exist. It is an admitted fact in  science, concerning which all geologists are agreed, that the separation  of England from the continent is an event comparatively modern and  perhaps cotemporaneous with the human race. Messrs. Constant  Prevost and d'Archiac have perfectly demonstrated it; the former by  pointing out the correspondence of the strata of chalk in both banks  of the channel, the second by demonstrating the identity of the con-  geries of rolled pebbles which overlies the chalk. This latter mass,  similar to that of our present rivers and streams, forms the most  superficial of the deposits, which was consequently formed after all the  rest. And as it is the same on both sides of the channel this layer  must have been deposited by the same current when the two countries  were still united. The separation took place later, occasioned, it  would seem, by the removal of the beds of chalk, which on either side  dip landwards and have an elevation towards the sea.  At the dawn of the present era England, then, formed a peninsula  similar to that of Denmark, The climate and the surface of the  country were what they now are, and the plants of France and Ger-  many soon occupied the lately emerged lands. The hardy growths  of northern Europe possessed themselves of the greater part. Forests  as dense as those of Germany then covered the hills of England.  Stagnant waters collected in hollow places, and the mosses and fens   VEGETABLE COLONIZATION. 235  which have replaced them still present to our view the hones and  horns of gigantic deer and the buried remains of those primeval  forests. Lost species of the ox, the hear, the wolf, the fox, were the  sole inhabitants of these solitudes. The task of nature was finished ;  that of man was to commence. On his appearance the forests fall  beneath the axe, the stagnant waters are drained with extended  culture, the animals disappear and the human population increases ;  the features of nature are transformed under the incessant progress of  civilization. This transformation, the triumph of human energies, is  as complete and profound as that wrought during the geologic cycle  when the present era succeeded to the glacier period.  In summing up the ideas of Messrs. Watson and Forbes respecting  the origin of the flora and fauna of the British archipelago, we may  say with them, that these ishands have been colonized by several suc-  cessive acquisitions from continental Europe from the period of the  mean tertiary dej^osits to our own era. When a vast continent  stretched from the Mediterranean regions to the British isles, the  idants of the Asturias and of Armorica peopled the south of England  and Ireland. To that period succeeded the glacier epoch, during  which the land was immerged to the height of about fifteen hundred  feet. This was the epoch of the migration of those Arctic plants which  still inhabit the summits of the Scottish mountains. When the land  emerged anew England was united to France, and the temperature  was what we now find it. x\\t this time the great Germanic incursion  took place, displacing, to a great extent, all the others, and leaving  hut scattered vestiges of their existence. Thus, while the Asturian  plants are reduced to a few species confined to the southwest of Ireland,  the robust progeny of the north finish their conquest, and possess  themselves of the soil which is destined at a still later date to become  the heritage of a race of human invaders issuing from the same  regions. The colonization completed, England is separated from the  continent, and this last geological incident, so insignificant in com-  parison with those that preceded it, has exercised an immense influ-  ence on the destinies of the world. Less isolated, England had been  less distinctively characterized; her stalwart races might, perhaps,  have been confounded with one of the great continental nations from  which they sprung.  While Messrs. Watson and Forbes were pointing out the continental  origin of the plants and animals of England, I was engaged in study-  ing the vegetable colonization of Shetland, Faroe, and Iceland. These  islands form, so to speak, a continuous chain, stretching from the  northern extremity of Scotland to the eastern coast of Greenland. I  had visited Faroe in 1839, and was struck with the character of its  vegetation. Though lost, as it were, in the midst of the Northern  ocean, its flora appeared composed of very familiar plants, most of  them indigenous to the plains of middle Europe; others inhabitants  of the Swiss Alps ; some of Scotland and of Greenland. Extending  my researches to Shetland and Iceland, I found that these islands  also have no vegetation peculiar to themselves, but that all their  plants are natives of the continent. The same result had been reached  by Mr. Watson in his researches into the Britannic flora. Here a   236 VEGETABLE COLONIZATION.  new problem presented itself: Did these vegetable colonies come from  Europe or America ? A great number of plants being common to  both the Old and New World, the question presented some difficulties.  I found, however, more than a hundred species exclusively European;  all the others were common to Europe and America. Europe, then,  must have had the greater share in the colonization of these archipe-  lagoes ; a great vegetable migration had advanced across England and  Scotland, the Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe islands, as far as Iceland.  Some species had come directly from the coasts of Norway. But, in  the mean time, in an opposite direction, the Arctic plants (natives of  Greenland) had propagated themselves across Iceland, Faroe, and  Shetland, to the mountains of Scotland, where they found a second  home. This double migration is evident from the proportional number  of the different plants ; for if we calculate that of exclusively European  plants which enter into the flora of Shetland, we find it to be a fourth,  that of Faroe but a seventh, and, finally, that of Iceland but a tenth.  Thus, as we leave Europe behind us, the number of plants of its  peculiar growth proportionably diminishes ; but, at the same time,  that of the plants of Greenland origin increases in very nearly an  inverse ratio.  Though entirely agreeing with Mr, Forbes as to the fact of the  colonization of the isles of the northern Atlantic, I hesitate before  adopting his bold and novel hypotheses. Without interrogating the  remote past, I find in the action of existing causes a plausible explana-  tion of the transportation of seeds from a continent to the nearest  islands, and from one island to another, from England as far as Ice-  land.  A great current (the gulf stream) takes its source in the Gulf of  Mexico^ follows the coast of America as high as Newfoundland, and  then traversing the Atlantic bathes the western shores of Scotland.  It is this which conveys thither the seeds of Mexico, still retaining  their germinative faculty ; it is this which has cast on the shores of  the Hebrides the Eriocaulon septangulare, a species belonging to North  America, and the only one of the British plants which is not also  European. In coasting the shores of Scotland the gulf stream collects,  doubtless^ the innumerable seeds which the water courses bear into the  sea, carries them northward with it, and strews them along the friths  and shallows of Shetland, Faroe^ and Iceland. This current appears  to me the principal agent in disseminating the plants of Europe  among these islands, and hence the predominance of the European  flora over that of North America.  The winds, those aerial streams, play their part also in the diffusion of  species, but, like that of the marine currents, it evades all direct ob-  servation. Whoever has once experienced those long and terrible  storms of wind which sweep the northern seas can hardly doubt their  efficiency in transporting from one island to another light seeds, often  furnished with down and membranes, which facilitate their suspension  in the air. A recent fact gives additional force to this conjecture.  The 2d September, 1845, at nine in the morning, there was an erup-  tion of Hecla in Iceland. On the 3d, cinders fell in the most southern  of the Faroes, and the same day were wafted to Shetland, the Ork-   VEGETABLE COLONIZATION. 237  neys,and were observed on the decks of vessels sailing between England  and Ireland.  There is another mode of transportation peculiarly incident to the  countries we are considering, and which I do not remember to have  seen noticed. I allude to birds of passage. Every spring millions of  maritime birds leave the coasts of Spain, France, and England, and  emigrate northward to lay and hatch their eggs on the solitary cliffs of  Shetland, Faroe, and Iceland. The autumn following they return to  Europe with their broods. These birds transport rapidly from isle  to isle the seeds of plants preserved in their crops or attached to  their feathers. They become in like manner a principal instru-  mentality in the American migration, for it is precisely at the close of  the summer of those regions, when the seeds are at maturity, that  they return towards the south. In these voyages the islands we speak  of serve for resting places, where they deposite the seeds which they  have transported through the air.  When we reflect that these united causes have been acting inces-  santly from the commencement of our era, that is, for thousands of  years, it is impossible to cast a doubt, on what must have been the  prominent effect of such prolonged agencies. Before ascending, then,  through the series of geologic ages to explain the distribution of or-  ganized beings over the surface of the earth, it would seem obvious that  the insufficiency of existing causes should be first demonstrated. And  this method is applicable to all the problems of geology. Heretofore,  during what might be called the theologic period of that science, it was  too much the custom to launch into the most extravagant supposi-  tions. According to the exigencies of the case, sudden revolutions,,  overwhelming catastrophes, colossal forces, unknown agents, and fan-  tastic causes were pressed into the service. At present, inc[uiry, having  become more sedate, seeks first the reason of geologic facts in the  powers of nature acting within the limits which they observe according  to our own experience, and enters not the field of hypothesis without  having first exhausted that of reality.*   ON THE CAUSES WHICH LIMIT VEGETABLE SPECIES TO-  WARDS THE NORTH, IN EUROPE AND SIMILAR REGIONS.

Nobody disputes this with re-  gard to the work of classification, and experience proves that the same  is the case as respects the study of the geographical distribution of  organized beings.  Having been occupied several years with the subject of botanical  geography, I have often had my attention recalled to a fundamental  problem, which will serve to explain many others in the same science.  This problem is to ascertain in what manner and after what laws spe-  cies are arrested in their geographical expansion, and this in the  simplest of conditions, on the surface, namely, of a continent apart  from the consideration of any mountains which may traverse it. It is  easy to conceive that the determination of the boundaries of species must  draw after it that of their proportion according to families in each  country, and that it connects itself with important questions in physi-  ology and agriculture. It is clear, also, that geologists and physicists  require to know to what extent the presence of the same species at two  epochs or in two countries determines the analogy of climates, and with  what degree of precision the geographical limit of a species proves an  equality in the exterior conditions of temperature.  The questions which arise out of this subject have almost always  reference to the limit towards the north, or to speak more exactly, to  the polar limit or that lying towards one of the poles. I leave out of  consideration, therefore, all that relates to the southerly limit.  On the subject of the polar limits opinions have changed with the pro-  gress of physical geography. Originally nothing but the mean annual  temperature of climates was observed ; and on comparing the limits of  species with this standard singular anomalies presented themselves.  In 1815 and 1817 M. de Humboldt introduced into physical geography  an important principle, viz : the comparison of lines passing across the  points which offer the same mean degree of temperature during the  year, the three months of winter, and the three of summer, being the  lines we term isothermal, isochimenal, and isotheral. This illustrious  scientist taught us that the mean temperature of seasons is of more  importance than that of the year, and that, in general, two similar  climates may be distributed into fractions very dissimilar, and which  neutralize one another in the estimate of the mean annual temperatures.  From this we might judge that the temperatures of seasons or monthly  temperatures would explain the habitat of species, or in other words,  that each species advances over a continent to a certain line which  marks an equal temperature during some period of the year, unless it  should be arrested by a climate too dry or too humid, or by a material  obstacle, such as the sea. I have believed and have heretofore said,*  that annual species ought to be limited very nearly according to iso-  theral lines, because their vegetation is confined in whole or in great part  to the three months of summer. It has seemed to me that the peren-  nial or ligneous species ought often to be limited to the lines of equal  temperature during some months of the mild season, or by the com-  parative shortness of the winters when the question regards plants  ^ Geographical disir^u'ion ff alimeniari/ J lani!.

The assiduity with  which botanists have considered this subject of a thermometrical mean  shows that more or less they have regarded it in the same light. It  has been the custom to attribute the disagreement between the limits  of plants and the lines of equal temperature to errors of observation on  the locality of species, to uncertainty respecting the thermometric  mean, or to causes acting independently of temperature, such as dry-  ness and humidity. But certain facts and the ingenious calculations of  M. Boussingault* on the heat requisite for culture in different countries,  have awakened some doubts as to the truth of this, and I have been  induced to attempt the solution of the question by a direct method.  The following is the course which I have pursued :  I have so far investigated nearly forty species as to feel no doubt of  any importance with regard to their polar limits. These species have  been solely chosen with a view of avoiding causes of error, and of hav-  ing, at the same time, plants of different nature. Hence I have  selected species having their limit in Europe, inasmuch as Europe is  the only region where the local flora is numerous, and where the con-  ditions of temperature are well known. I have eliminated all the culti-  vated species, all species easy to confound with others, all which might  have escaped the observation of the authors of local floras, as well as  those in which synonyms might have occasioned embarrassment. I  have centred my researches on a dozen annual species, a dozen peren-  nial, and a dozen ligneous. I have established their polar limits by  means of a great number of floras and catalogues, by the inspection of  herbals, and also by questions addressed to botanists residing in  some of the less explored parts of Europe. I have succeeded in tracing  on the map the limit of these species. I have afterwards consulted  the most complete tables of the monthly temperature and seasons of  European cities, such as those of Kiimtz, Berghaus, Mahlmann, and  Dove, completing them by means of private researches.  The following is what results at first view from this comparison,  founded on well ascertained facts :  1. In no case does the limit of a species exactly coincide with a line  of equal temperature for any one period of the year.  2. The limits of annual species, in the plains of Europe, cross one  another with considerable frequency. The limits of perennial and  ligneous species also cross each other in different directions,, and both  are far from being parallel when they do not thus cross.  This single fact enables us to perceive how much the lines of vege-  tation differ from the lines of equal temperature ; for if we draw lines  founded on the equality of heat, at a certain season, they will be found  to vary little from parallel lines; if we take some other season such  lines will still appear nearly parallel with one another, though differ-  ent, without doubt, from the preceding. Thus, the isochimenal lines  will cross the isotheral ones, but they will never cross each other  at least in a level country.  A little reflection will teach us that it would be chimerical to pur-  sue the comparison of vegetable limits with the lines of equal tempera-  - Bouseingault, Economie RuraU, IT, p. 659.   240 CAUSES WHICH LIMIT  ture, at least in Europe and in all countries analogously situated.  According as the climate of any locality is more or less excessive, that  is, more or less different from one season to another, the vegetation of  a plant commences and finishes at different epochs of the year. The  lines of like temperature relate to fixed periods, and the vegetation of  any one species in Europe lasts during periods which are variable.  There can then be no agreement between these two classes of fact,  unless by some special accident.  In arriving at the law which governs the limitation of species, I  have been led to dwell upon two principles, the truth of which is  admitted by all agriculturists and botanists, but whose combined  effect had until now received no adequate attention.  It is plain that a great heat during a short period must produce the  same effect on plants with a less degree of heat during a longer term.  The cultivators who would force or retard plants do nothing but com-  bine the duration and the degree of heat. They thus succeed in pro-  ducing the flower or the matured fruit at a given day. M. Boussin-  gault has given these facts in a precise form by showing that, for  the greater part of our cultivated annual plants, when we count the  number of days that the culture has continued, and multiply that  number of days by the mean temperature maintained, we arrive at the  same product for each culture in all countries and for all years. The  heat acts then proportionally as regards its duration and its force.  But M. Boussingault has not presented the result of his calculations  under so general a form^ and in this he was right. There is, in effect^  a second principle, which modifies the one in question, and which is of  equal importance, at least in botanical geography.  This second principle is, that each species requires, for each one of  its physiological functions, a certain minimum of temperature. Not  only is any temperature below zero useless to plants, en account of the  congelation of its juices, but even those of 1Â°, 2Â°^ and 3Â°,* are useless  to a great nun.iber of species, and ought not to be computed among  the temperatures available for the plant. Cultivate wheat, for in-  stance, under a temperature constantly below 4Â°, though the plant  will live long, and the product of the number of days by the tempera-  ture reach a high number, yet the stalk will not grow tall nor will the  flower be formed. M. Ch. Martins has said, with truth, that each  species of the vegetable kingdom is a kind of thermometer which has  its own zero.f We should be wrong, then, to infer that 10Â° during ten  days would have the same effect on all plants as 5Â° during twenty  days. In both cases the sum of atmospheric heat is expressed by  100Â°; but for species which do not vegetate below 6Â°, for example,  the amount of 100 must be diminished by all the values between 5Â°  and 6Â°, which occur in one of the supposed cases, while for those  species which do not vegetate below 10Â°, if any such exist, the avail-  able heat would be reduced to 0. If we would estimate the heat really  useful to a species we must consider, in our calculation, only the values  above a certain degree of temperature, which varies according to the  species. Direct observation seldom permits of our verifying the min-  * These degrees are centigrade.  â– \\ Voyagt BoUmique in Norwegt.   VEGETABLE SPECIES. 241  imum necessary to eacli species for each of its functions, but botanical  feogra'>hy will furnish us the means of doing so, if, as I propose to  emonstrate, the limits of species depend at the same time on the  quantity of heat and the minimum required for each species. And  here I enter on a field which has not hitherto been explored.  An example will enable us to comprehend how the two principles  of which I am speaking combine in European climates, and brino-  about a similitude or dissimilitude to which the means ordinarily  employed furnish no key.  London and Odessa are certainly not under the same lines of tem-  perature. The mean of summer heat is at London 16Â°. 7, at Odessa  20Â°, while in winter the difference of the mean is much greater. In  their monthly mean these two climates have no analogy. Notwith-  standing, if we consider the time at which the temperature of 4Â°. 5  oommences and terminates in each of these cities, and the product  which represents the heat between these two limits, we find the same  figure. At London the mean of 4Â°. 5 commences the 17th of February,  and terminates the 15th of December. Between these two periods the  figure expressing, according to the process of M. Boussingault, the  heat received, is 3431Â°. At Odessa the temperature of 4Â°. 5 com-  mences later, from the 2d to the 3d of April, and terminates sooner,  from the 17th to the 18th of November, but as it is warmer during  summer, the amount of the temperature between those limits is almost  equal to that of London, for it is 3423Â°. Hence a plant which would  require 4Â°. 5 to commence vegetating with a certain activity, which  should arrive at the same condition, and would require in all an  amount of heat of 3430Â°, might advance in a northwest direction to  London, and in a northeast to Odessa. If a plant should require  more or less than 4Â°. 5 as a minimum, or more or less than 3430Â° in  the whole, the climates would no longer correspond, and the limit of  species would be otherwise established.  This shows us how two European climates, which differ when con-  sidered, as regards their respective mean monthly temperature, may  yet be identical under certain combinations of the two causes which  exert an influence on the life of species. For the purpose of discover-  ing these correspondences of climates I have calculated for a certain  number of the cities of Europe on what days the temperature of 1Â°, 2Â°,  3Â°, &c., up to 8Â°, commences and ends. I have placed over against  this list the product indicating the heat received over and above each  of those degrees in all the localities. The application of these figures  t-o the facts of vegetation is highly satisfactory, notwithstanding cer-  tain sources of error impossible wholly to avoid. I shall here cite but  two examples.  The Alyssum calycinum is a cruciferous annual, which grows here  and there on the eastern coast of Great Britain and as high as Edin-  burgh, and even a little beyond, as far as Arbroath. It is found neither  on the western coast of England nor in Ireland, nor yet in Brittany or  Calvados ; but this must be attributed to the constant humidity of  those regions, for the Alyssum calycinum prefers a dry region, and it  16   242 CAUSES WHICH LIMIT  is evident tliat it is not heat that is wanting in Brittany to a plant  which grows in Scotland.  On- the continent the Alyssum calycinum spreads to the northwest  as far as Holstein and the Baltic, on the northeast as far as Moscow,  hut not to Kasan. The limit in the quarters where its extension may  he thought to he determined solely hy temperature stretches, there-  fore, from Arbroath, in Scotland, under the 56| degree of latitude,  passes along the 54th degree in Holstein, and thence oscillates in  Russia between the 56th and 55th degree. I shall not stop to show in  detail how much this line varies from any isothermal line, isotheral,  or other founded on equality of temperature. Comparing only the two  extremities, Arbroath, in Scotland, with an annual average of 8Â°,  Moscow of 4Â°. 5, Arbroath with a summer average of 14Â°, Moscow  of 1TÂ°.8, it will be seen that the mean of each month varies strikingly.  I consult laj table of the correspondence of climates, and I find that  at Kinfauns, in Scotland, very near Arbroath, the temperature of 7Â°  or upwards continues from the 18th of April to the 31st of October, and  that during this time the product of the number of days by the mean  temperature amounts to 2281Â°. At Konigsberg the temperature of  7Â° and upwards is of shorter duration, but the summer being hotter,  the product amounts to 2308Â°. As the limit of the species is about  twenty leagues to the north of Konigsberg, that figure must be  reduced, and becomes identical with that of Scotland. At Moscow  the mean of \"7Â° commences the 22d of April, and terminates the 5th of  October ; the product, in consequence of the heat of summer, rises to  24*73Â°. This is more than seems necessary to the Alyssum, and I am  induced to believe that it may live thirty or forty leagues to the north  of Moscow, but there is no local flora to furnish the assurance of it.  At Kasan, the figures fall to 2196Â°, so that it is not surprising that  the species there disappears. Thus the hypothesis of TÂ° of initial  temperature and of a product of 2280Â° to 2300Â° accords completely  with the facts.  I shall cite another example derived from a ligneous species.  The Euonymus europa3us has for a limit the north of Ireland, Edin-  burgh, (56^- deg. latitude,) the north of Denmark, the south of Swe-  den, (57 â€” 58 lat.,) the isle of Aland, at the entrance of the Gulf of  Bothnia, (60 lat.,) Moscow, Pensa, (52 lat.) Tliis limit varies 8Â°  of latitude. In its course the mean annual temperatures vary 4Â°,  the mean winter 12Â°. 7, and the mean summer 3Â°. 4. Those from  March to November, which are more conformable, still vary to the  extent of 1Â°.5, and the species, moreover, disappears at several points  where the mean of this period of the year is overpassed. The average  from April to October and of each other period of the year does not  coincide more closely. It is necessary, then, to renounce this mode of  explanation. But an hypothesis is at hand which accords with all  the facts. The Euonymus europa3US requires a product of 2480Â° be-  tween the two epochs of the year when the curve of mean tempera-  ture ascends above 6Â°. In effect this product at Edinburgh is 2482Â°.  In Sweden the city of Stockholm is situated beyond the limit, the  product there being but 2268Â°. St. Petersburgh, with a product of   VEGETABLE SPECIES. 243  1894Â°, is likewise beyond it. The isle of Aland, where, as we are  told, the species grows, may well have a more elevated figure than the  neighboring cities of Stockholm and St. Petersbiirgh, in virtue of the  influence of the sea, but we possess no observations as to this point.  At Moscow the product exceeds somewhat the supposed condition,  being 2524Â° ; but probably, also, the species advances a little toward  the north of that city at a point where express information again fails  lis. Finally, it is not found at Kasan, and here also the product is  only 2250Â°. The values then found along the limit, in its neigh-  borhood and beyond it, accord as nearly as. could be desired in such a  matter with our double hypothesis of 6Â° and 24 80Â°.  The chartreux pink, (Dianthus carthusianorum,) a perennial species,  is arrested at the west by humidity, but from Koningsberg to Kasan,  where its limit depends upon temperature, it is requisite that the  plant should receive 2450 degrees between the day when the mean of  5 degrees commences and that when it terminates.  When hypotheses of this character are thus verified successively in  many separate cases, and when they repose moreover on incontestable  principles of physiology, it may be assumed that they correspond with  a law of nature.  That law may, in the present case, be enunciated in the following  terms : Every species Itaving Us polar limit in central or northern Europe  advances as far as it finds a certain fixed amount of heat, calcnlated from  the day when a certain mean temperature commences to the day when that  mean tei'minates.  The apparent exceptions to this rule may be explained by two cir-  cumstances, which restrict its application.  1. Many species, even in our temperate or northern climates, are  influenced as to a portion of their limit by humidity and dryness more  than by the conditions of temperature. Those which shun the dryness  have a limit inclining from the northwest to the southeast â€” the east-  ern part of the continent being the dryest. The species which shun  humidity have a limit inclining from the northeast to the southwest,  because the more humid regions are, of course, those lying toward th'e  ocean. These causes often determine the west and east limits of  species. Quite frequently the same species will be found limited to the  east and west by circumstances of this kind, and to the north by the  operation of the law above stated. In calculating therefore the figures  deduced from temperature, we must ascertain the point at which  the limit ceases to be regulated by one of the accessory causes and  tails v/ithin the control of the law of temperature.  2. The perennial species, and, above all, the ligneous ones, are  sometimes arrested towards the nortli by the absolute minima of tem-  perature. The limit inclines in this case from the northwest to the  southeast, because the intense cold prevails most in the interior of the  continent. In tracing a limit of species from west to east, if the law  as stated ceases to be applicable, the species may be regarded as having  encountered the action either of severe cold or of drought; and it is  often difficult to discriminate which of these two causes operates as an   244 CAUSES WHICH LIMIT  obstacle. We can only mark on the map the point where_, the usual  law ceasing to apply, one of these two causes begins to act.  While the effect of temperature on species was sought for only in  thermometric averages and the minima of winter, it was impossible to  explain why a great number of the species stop precisely in those  parts of Europe where the mean temperatures differ least at great dis-  tances. Of this, Scotland is the most striking example. A multitude  of species have their limit near Edinburgh; to such an extent indeed  that the flora of the country beyond the Grampian mountains has  always been considered rather an appendage of the floras of Lapland  and the Shetland Isles than of the British. Yet the mean of tempera-  ture, compared month by month, differs surprisingly little from one  extremity of Scotland to the other. The law above stated enables  us to understand these facts. Precisely because of the uniformity and  slight variability of mean temperatures in Scotland, there elapses a  long interval of time between the day when the temperature of 4Â°, for  example, commences, and that when the temperature of 5Â° begins.  If, then, two species are organized in such a manner as to commence  actively vegetating â€” the one at 4Â°, the other at 5Â° â€” the first will re-  ceive for a length of time a heat which is useless to the other, and  consequently their limits will diverge considerably. It is not the same  under an easterly climate, where the transition from 4Â° to 5Â°, 6Â°,  and so on, takes place so rapidly that all species begin to vegetate  nearly at the same time. Hence, in the west, the limits are influenced  especially by the initial and final temperatures necessary for each  species; in the east by the sum total of heat.  The examples on which I have relied are drawn from plants of the  centre and north of Europe. I have no doubt but that in countries  analogously situated, whether in Asia or North America, we should  find the same facts with regard to other species. It would only re-  quire that those regions should be as well known as Europe to enable  us to verify in detail both the temperatures and the limits. More to  the south dryness and humidity seem the principal causes of the  limitation of species. Besides, when the temperature operates it is in  those regions much more uniform and much more proportional from  one season to another, in all localities similarly situated, which is the  reason why the average of the year or the season is competent to re-  place the complicated law which governs species. Indeed, on the  borders of the Mediterranean sea, tlie limits have appeared to me so  often determined by the humidity, or by causes still unknown, that  the operation of the temperature has almost always eluded my calcu-  lations.  The law with which I have been occupied has its application no  doubt to the limitation of species as regards altitude. It will show  why it is that species do not observe the same relative distances on  the flanks of different chains of mountains ; why, in other words^ the  limits of height cross one another in the same way with the limits on  the surface of a continent.  It is also probable that by means of this law we shall be able to explain  the periods of flowering and maturing for species in different localities   VEGETABLE SPECIES. 245  and different years ; but in this regard we must expect to encounter in  its application difficulties arising as well from the nature of tlie facts  to be observed as from the variableness of the years.*  \" For the epochs of vegetation, as for heights souiewhat considcrabhj, and for polar re-  gions, a circumstance touching the manner of c^^lculating temperatures will render tl;e  appliciition of the law rather difficult. In thermometrical averages the ligures below 0Â°,  are made to enter as negatives ; now, it would be necessary, in order to appreciate the  action upon plants, to regard them as nought, without retrenching anything from the  values above 0Â°, 1Â°, 2^, &c. A species which would manifest the effect of a heat of 1Â°,  might vegetate in a season wlien the mean ehould be greatly below 0Â°, according to the  ordinary mode of calculation. It wourd suffice that the thermometer lias been above 0^  for a certain number of hours. This consideration has prevented me from taking for a  subject of study species which have their polar limit in Iceland, Lapland, and under other  very high latitudes. Tlie meteorological tables give the monthly averages calculated by sub-  traction of the negative values ; and even when tlie observations are given in detail, it is  difficult, and often impossible, to know during how many hours in a month the thermo-  meter has been above each of the degrees. I solicit the attention of calculators to this  point.  Finally, it will be incumbent on zoologists to examine whether the law we have given  does not regulate the limits of certain descriptions of animals ; of those especially which are  hatched from eggs, or which recover from a hybernating torpor at certuin temperatures,  and which thus require, I suppose, for the total of their active life a certain amount of heat.  Zoology and botany having always made a parallel progress, it is seldom th;it a law dis-  covered in one of these sciences does not immefliately receive its application in the other.  As for the relations which connect botanical geography with geology, they become every  day more numerous. Perhaps geologists will take pleasure in seeing that the mode of  action of temperature upon actual species may be stated with precision. Let them permit  me, in closing, a reflection concerning the islands which lie in the neighlwrhood of the  European continent. It has occurred incidentally in the course of my researches. If it  presents no new results, whicli I do not know, it will have at least the advantage of resting  on facts foreign to geology itself.  As regards the British isles, the actual limits of the species which I have examined al-  v/a}'s admit of explanation from meteorological causes, without the material obstacle of the  sea appearing in the least to influence them. The limits are not the shore of the ocean ; but  if a species is wanting to tlie British isles, it is wanting also to the opposite and neighbor-  ing coast, especially to Brittany, the climate of which is nearly similar ; if it exists upon  the shores of the continent, it exists also in England. We may conclude from this, either  that the seeds have been transported without difficulty across the Channel, which is not  probable for most of them, or rather that the arm of the sea has been formed within the  existence of the actual species. We know that this opinion has been recently maintained  by Mr. Forbes, who explains after an analogous manner certain relations between the  British islands and remoter countries, sucli as Spain, the Azores, Lapland, &c. With re-  gard to the islands of the Mediterranean sea the facts are different. I might cite several  cases in which it is impossible to explain the presence or absence of a species on meteorolo-  gical reasons. Thus, according to the observations, rather imperfect it is true, of M. de la  Marmora, the south of Sardinia presents the same conditions as regards rain and monthly  temperature with certain parts of Sicily ; yet many of the species of Sicily are wanting to  Sardinia and vice versa. Tlie chamiurops humilis grows in Sardinia and at Yillefranche near  Nice ; it fails in Corsica, which is between them. In general, notwithstanding certain evi-  dent analogies of vegetation, the islands and peninsulas of the Mediterranean offer numer-  ous anomalies in the limits of species. It would seem that this region had been disturbed  by many successive geological revolutions since the existence of the vegetables of our epoch,  and that the accidental transportation of seeds had been, to this day, insufficient to bring  about a conformity between the limits and the climates.   246 FORESTS AND TEEES OF KOSTH AMERICA.

A favor will he conferred by any person who may furnish  materials for extending or correcting the list of trees herewith ap-  pended.]  The list appended to this article has been prepared in order to show  the present state of knowledge of the distribution of the most import-  ant and useful trees and shrubs of the country, and at the same time  to elicit further information on this interesting subject.  With these objects in view, it has been attempted to give, where  known, the extreme points to which each species extends in every  direction, and at the same time to show in what part of the country  it attains its greatest development and abundance. The chief defi-  ciency in the first part of the plan has been found to be' the want of  precise localities in the limits mentioned by botanists. For instance,  a tree may be described as found in Virginia, and yet not occur for  hundreds of miles in travelling through that large State, which  includes parts of three very distinct botanical regions. Any positive  locality is of more use in determining range than such statements as  the foregoing, for it enables botanists to increase the known range by  observations in their own districts. The various State collections and  reports have given the most accurate information on this subject, but  very much is still wanting, and, in fact, respecting the range of most  trees east of the Mississippi, scarcely anything has been added to the  published observations of the two Michaux.  In regard to the region of greatest abundance, there is much of the  same want of accurate knowledge. In some cases it has been neces-  sary to judge of this irom the nature of the country and the known  preference of the tree for particular kinds of soil, or its ability to  withstand cold. Although there is much uncertainty on this subject,  it will probably be found that the chief facts now known are stated ;  since I have, at least, good authority for the occurrence, if not for  the abundancCj of each tree in the region where it is considered most  characteristic. Thus, in the absence of statistical information, it was  necessary to select for the Mississippi region : 1st. Trees of the  swamps, which have their central or maximum of number and develop-  ment in such a locality. 2d. Such as extend scarcely north of Georgia,  and, presumptively, are more common in the warmer region near the  Gulf of Mexico. The trees believed to be peculiar to any region have   FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA. 247  their name (abbreviated) in small capitals in the last column. The  character (?) prefixed to a locality indicates doubt whether this or  some allied species is really the one attributed to that place.  Future information may lead to the addition to the general lists of  some trees included in the lists of trees nearly peculiar to Florida  and Mexico, or to the contrary change. The numbers and letters  prefixed to the names are intended to refer to charts of the distribu-  tion of trees, now in course of preparation. As trees do not form a  natural series distinct from other plants, and as size does not serve  as a criterion for their separation from shrubs, it might be considered  more scientific to have included all looody plants in this catalogue ;  but as that would have swelled the list entirely beyond bounds, I  have made a selection, guided first by the size, and secondly by utility,  independent of size. It may be advisable in future to add to or to  omit some of the species. Thus, as to the grape vines, Prunus  maritima and Cerasus pumila, I included these and a few more woody  plants, not properly trees, for various reasons. Some of the vines  grow a foot in diameter, and are of use for wood as well as fruit.  The others are interesting as analogues of trees, growing under  peculiar circumstances. They may, too, become worth cultivation  for fruit ; and one of my objects was to include all such as far as pos-  sible. The species of Crataegus and Pr?w?is mostly come under this  exception.  The reason for giving the maximum heights is, that it is thought  the cultwation of trees will become some day a matter of national  interest, and I wish to show what they are under the best natural  circumstances, supposing that, with cultivation, they will at least  equal this standard. Some of the western plants are little more than,  shrubs ; _ but as the western regions are comparatively poor in trees,  I have stretched the limit a little there, since shrubs become more  valuable where trees diminish in number.  Nearly all the varieties mentioned by various authors are given ;  because, first, the difterence between a species and a permanent variety  is scarcely definable ; second, because they are often as truly charac-  teristic of botanical regions as the species themselves. In this article  Popuhis canadensis is separated from P. monili/era for example,  because Micliaux could not identity the latter east of the Mississippi ;  and we look upon it as belonging rather to the Rocky Mountain than  to the Apalachian province.  As Michaux notices a diflference in the beeches of Canada and the  more southern United States, we preferred (as in the other supposed  varieties) to consider them as species having distinct ranges, until  enough good specimens can be procured to determine the fact. It is  doubtful whether there are any trees extending entirely across the  continent, within the limits of the United States, which are not more  properly included among those of the Lacustrian or Mexican provinces.  Collections of the leaves, fruits, bark, and wood of our native trees  are particularly desirable, and from as many localities as possible, in  order to determine both their range and abundance, and also to decide  those knotty points as to true specific distinctions, which still perplex   248 FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA.  the most skilful botanists. The specimens from each tree should be  tept carefully together, and the name of the locality and collector  given in full. Without such collections no information as to the  large genera of oaks, hickories, magnolias, and, in fact, most others,  can be at all depended on or made use of. Collections from the ex-  treme corners of the United States, and from any part of the western  mountains, will be particularly useful in determining all these ques-  tions. A good way of preserving a complete set from each species of  tree is to obtain two pieces of the thick bark of the trunk about a foot  square, talcing care not to ruh off the mosses w lichens^ which are often  very characteristic of the tree. Other specimens of bark from the  branches, sufficient to show all its changes in appearance, and twigs  with leaves, flowers and fruits, may be pressed between the trunk  bark, with sufficient paper of any kind intervening, to absorb all  moisture. One change of this paper will usually be sufficient,  (especially if the bark is dry ;) and fruits, if large and hard, may  be so fixed as to hang outside^ wrapped in paper. Particular care is  necessary to prevent mixture of specimens. Blocks of wood from the  trunk and branches at various seasons are also desirable for experi-  menting upon.  Observations as to the relative abundance of each tree at the various  stations may be expressed numerically, thus : very rare, 1 ;. occasion-  ally met with, 2 ; not uncommon, 3 ; common, 4 ; very common, 5 ;  abundant, 6, &c.; using numbers up to 10, and explaining them.  Frequently several trees will be found so nearly alike in abundance as  to require the same number. Notice should also be made of the  nature of the country and soil â€” whether mountainous, rocky, gravelly^,  sandy, or swampy, which will help to determine the limits of the  natural regions. The geological structure of the district is, however,  of secondary importance.  The columns of range may be used by observers filling the blanks  or adding to the recorded range in either direction ; but this must be  done carefully and with a perfect knowledge of the species noted.  The name of the county should be given as well as of the town, and is  preferable if only one is stated. Such blanks, filled up, may be cut  out and sent to the Smithsonian Institution, addressed to the Com-  missioner of Patents, with the writer's name. Meteorological ob-  servers will take a special interest in the subject, and in most cases  can make the best notes from their habit of observing the connexions  of peculiarity of climate and forest growth.  In the annexed catalogue generic and general English names are in  capitals. The most important synonyms are given in italics, as well  as local or little-used English names.

This outline map of tbat part of America nortli of Mexico is in-  tended to illustrate, so far as can be done on so small a scale, the  distribution of forests, trees, &c., according to the results of the latest  explorations and studies. In order to get it within the size of the  page it was found necessary to make the principal meridian oblique  to the sides of the map, but by noticing the corresponding numbers of  the degrees of latitude the reader will easily perceive the true direc-  tion of the several points, east and west being, of course, nearly at  right angles to the meridian. The equatorial projection is preferred,  as showing best the true area of the various regions. The dark full  lines crossing the continent are the outlines of the best determined  and most important natural divisions, which may be called natural  PROVINCES. The broken lines represent approximately the subdivi-  sions of these provinces, called regions, and also parts of the province  boundaries not accurately determined.  The undulations of surface, mountains, and other circumstances  cause great irregularities in the outlines of regions, especially in the  western part of the continent ; but these are neither well determined  nor, if they were, are they capable of illustration on this scale. It is  believed, however, that the most marked limits are represented, that  is, those by which the greatest number of species, both of plants and  animals, are bounded in their range.  In using this map the reader should compare it with a good and  large map of North America. The regions in which trees are found  (indicated by letters on the map) are :  A. The Algonquin, in which four or five species of trees seem to  be more abundant than elsewhere, and therefore characl eristic ;  none, however, are peculia7\\ - - - - - 5  B. The Athabascan, in which about twelve are characteristic but  none peculiar - - - - - - 12  C Canadian, having seventeen characteristic trees and one appa-  rently peculiar - - - - - - -18  D. Alleghany, in which there are twenty-four trees characteristic  and six peculiar - - - - - - 30  E. Ohio, having twenty-two characteristic and one peculiar - 23  F. Tennesseean, with thirty-four characteristic and three peculiar 37  G. Carolinian, with eighteen characteristic and seven peculiar - 25  H. Mississippian, with thirty-two characteristic and seven pecu-  liar - â– â€¢ - - - - - - 39  I. Floridian, with about thirty-two characteristic and thirteen  peculiar - . - - - - - 45   Total number of species in the eastern forest regions - - 234   D, E, F, G, H, may be considered as forming a natural province,  and called the Apalachian. Florida appears rather to belong to the  West Indian province.   FOEESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA. 269  J, the Texan, K, the Illinois, and L, the SasJcatcheivan regions^  are characterized by prairies ; and the forests, which occur only near  their eastern borders and along the rivers, gradually decreasing  towards the west, are composed entirely of species characteristic of  the region eastward. No new ones occur, while a large number of  trees disappear at the commencement of prairies. M, the BacotaJi,  and N, the Camanche regions, are composed of these great treeless  and often arid plains which skirt the eastern slopes of the Rocky  mountains. Trees occur only in narrow belts along the rivers, and  for about three hundred miles east of the mountains most of the  streams are entirely woodless.  These five regions are, however, supplied with numerous peculiar  plants and animals, mostly of quite distinct species from those of the  forest-clad regions eastward. They are so well marked, in these  respects, that, together, they may be considered as forming a natural  PROVINCE, which, from its most remarkable character of plains, is  called Campestrian.  0, P, Q, may be named, from the Mexican States which partly com-  pose them, Tamaulipan, Choahuilan, and Chihuahimn regions ; but  too little is known of them to define their limits well. Their trees  are given in the list of those along the Mexican boundary, and these  are found almost exclusively along the Rio Grande, within the United  States. Only seven or eight species are found, in addition to the few  which extend from the Mississippi region and Florida. - - 8  R, the Arizonian region, though in great part treeless, furnishes  a large number of additional species, some of which are probably  more common in the adjoining Mexican States of Sonora and Lower  California, while others, chiefly among the San Francisco mountains,  seem to be nearly or quite peculiar.  The former, thirteen in number, are included in the Mexican Boun-  dary list, while the fourteen characteristic and ten (?) peculiar are in  the catalogue of Western trees. - - - - - 37  These numbers, except the total, must, however, be considered as far  from settled, as the surrounding regions are but little explored, and  in a region so poorly wooded, as most of it is, ten peculiar species  could scarcely be expected. It will be remarked also, that most of  these trees characteristic of the Mexican boundary are not over fifteen  or twenty feet high, and in many cases these are extreme heights.  Shrubs constituting the dense tliickets called chapparal take the place  of forests over great tracts.  S, the Wasatch region, almost unexplored, is not known to have  any trees peculiar to it; but as the mountain summits are usually well  wooded, some may be hereafter found characteristic, if not peculiar. 1  T, the Padoucan, has apparently two peculiar pines, but its vege-  tation is scanty in forests, and but little explored. - - 2  U, the Utah region, being, as far as explored, almost woodless, it  is rather surprising to find that the only tree which is abundant on  some of its mountains is apparently almost peculiar to it â€” the Juni-  perns occidentalis. - - - - - - -1  V, the Shoshonee region, though, like the last, almost woodless on  its plains^ has some well-wooded mountain ranges, on which a larch   270 FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA.  and several pines are found. Two willows have as yet been found only  in it. One pine is believed to be more common here than elsewhere. 3  In the four last regions the place of forests is also supplied by nu-  merous peculiar shrubs, mostly very distinct from any of the trees, as  well as from the chapparal of Mexico, though some of the same genera  appear as in the latter. These are not all stunted trees, but of entirely  different families, and formed especially for the arid regions they in-  habit. R, S, T, U, V, together, form a peculiar province, which may  be distinguished as the Rocky Mountain Province.  W, the Californian region, is the most highly favored of the western  groups in the variety, though not of the extent of its forests, which  are confined chiefly to the mountains, while most the species occur  in groups, scattered singly through the prairie. Eighteen trees are  considered characteristic, and e{(//i^eew peculiar; making, in all, - 36  Seven others are found near San Diego, and are probably charac-  teristic of Lower California.  X, the Oregonian, is densely wooded over nine-tenths of its surface,  prairies occurring chiefly in the valleys of the southern part, and  gradually disappearing towards the north. Thirteen trees are considered  characteristic, and nine peculiar, though the unexplored character of the  regions northward may make the number larger than it really is, 22  Y, the Kootanic region, is described as very densely wooded almost  everywhere, and certainly that part which extends south of latitude  49Â° is covered with forests almost equal in size and density to those of  the Oregonian. Eight trees are believed to be among those character-  istic of it, and some will probably be found peculiar. - - 8  Z, the Yukon region, is believed to be generally wooded, but almost  nothing is known of it or its peculiar products. Some trees have been  found as far north as Kotzebue's Sound, (2) the northern limit of trees  which are not known farther south, but may be Asiatic, Six of those  in the catalogue are attributed to this region, as they are found only  as stragglers within the boundary of the United States. - - 6  The trees of the western regions (including the Mexican boundary  group) are, therefore, 131 species. The great wooded regions of the  northwest â€” X, Y, and Z â€” apparently form a province distinct from  those east or south of them.  W partakes of the characters of those of Lower California and Ari-  zona, and with the former may form a province to be called the  Nevadian. Further exploration is, however, necessary to decide their  mutual relations.  Although neither time nor space will permit here a full statement  of the grounds on which the dividing lines are laid down, yet a short  statement of the principal ones will be necessary, in order to enable  observers to collect and increase information on this interesting branch  of Physical Geography. Trees represent only certain families and  genera of plants, and their distribution alone would not, therefore,  indicate that of other plants and of animals; but forests have a won-  derful influence on both, and it is well known ito naturalists that neither  rivers, lakes, nor mountains separate the range of so many species as  the line where a continuous forest skirts a woodless country.  The full line 1 â€” 2, broken towards the west, shows the northern   FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA. 271  limit of forest growth. It is laid down from the information given  Ly Eichardson, Belcher, and other arctic explorers, and is one of the  best defined boundaries of organized beings on the continent. North  of it there are no trees and but few woody plants ; the vegetation is  mostly peculiar ; and the animals, numerous in species, in but few  instances extend south of it. Both are generally identical entirely  around the north pole, and this therefore forms part of the Arctic  Province; while many peculiar species as well as marked geographical  boundaries separate it Irom the Asiatic portion and, it may be called  the Esquimaux Begion. This line coincides well with the yearly  isothermal of 17Â° 5', summer 50Â°, winter â€” 15Â°, in all that portion  between Hudson bay and the Mackenzie river, but it seems probable  that other circumstances besides temperature regulate the forest limit  near the east and west ends. Neither the climate nor vegetation of  these parts is yet well enough known to admit even of speculations on  this subject.  A, B, and C, may, together, be considered as forming a Province,  which, from the number of its great lakes, may be called the Lacusti'ian.  It is well characterized by its forests, almost unbroken, consisting  chiefly of evergreen Corifera, which afford food and shelter to a large  number of characteristic animals. It comprises most of the fur coun-  tries of North America. It is only near the Alleganies that its limits  are obscure, but the broken lines there indicate the average range of  its characteristic species. The next line southward is 3 â€” 4, running  nearly parallel to 1 â€” 2, and separating the water-sheds of Hudson Bay  and the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the basins of the Great Lakes and  Lake Winnipeg. It forms the northern limit to a large number of  trees, &c., but can only be considered approximate towards its eastern  end. It corresponds very well with the isotherm of 37Â° 5', summer  G0Â°, winter 15Â°. The careful observations of Richardson at its  western end show that there are about 24 species of trees common  north of it, while many cease to grow very abruptly in the vicinity of  Lake Winnipeg.  The country between 1 â€” 2 and 3 â€” 4 is divided for convenience into  two regions, A the Algonquin, and B the Athabascan. Though the  peculiar products of each are little known, there seem to be indications  even among the trees of considerable difference, especially in the 2^^^-  'portions. The Algonquin is almost unexplored, but will probably be  found to have the greatest numbers of several of the trees mentioned  in the catalogue, as most abundant in adjoining regions ; none are,  however, peculiar to either of these northern regions.  The line 5 â€” G is used to bound approximately the Canadian Begion  on the southeast, though from the nature of the country there is no  well marked division there, the valleys belonging to one region and  the mountains to the other.  The numbers 5 â€” 6 â€” 7 indicate the general limits of D, the Alle-  ghany Begion comprising the eastern slopes, and towards the south,  some of the highest peaks and ridges of this range ; 24 trees are con-  sidered characteristic, and G peculiar to it. Towards the west and  south its limits are not well marked from the uneven surface of the  country, but to the southeast the line between it and G is the abrujit   272 FORESTS AND TEEES OF NORTH AMERICA.  geological boundary, between the metamorphic roclss of the hills and  those of later date, corresponding to the change in soil characterizing  the sandy flat low country.  The line 7 â€” 8 is the northwestern boundary of G, and a very natu-  ral one both geologically and botanically. The range of animals also  corresponds to it in some degree. The boundary indicated by 9 â€” 10  is not a fixed limit, since the natural history of Florida is still but  little known. There is, however, a geological line near this point,  which, with the rapid increase of temperature southward, will proba-  bly be found to limit the greater number of species characteristic of  Florida. The line connecting this with 8 is also only arbitrary or  geographical, as it separates the waters of the Atlantic and of the  Gulf. There seem to be several trees_, however, limited in range near  it, and probably none can be made more natural. 8 â€” 12 is a continu-  ation of the line separating the low, sandy country from the granitic  and limestone formations of the hilly country. From 12 it extends  southwest, bordering the hilly table-land west of the Mississippi  valley.  The hrohen line 6 â€” 12 is one of the most unsettled of all. Though  a number of trees are limited in this vicinity, there is no geological or  geographical line by which they may be bounded, and an attempt is  therefore made to make an average limit, depending on climate and  elevation as well as on the actual facts of distribution.  An eminent geologist has suggested to me that perhaps the southern  limit of the drift may be found the true boundary here and on the  lineof 15â€” 16.  The lines G â€” 6 â€” 15 â€” 16 may represent the summer isothermal of  about 75Â°, while 7 â€” 6 â€” 15 â€” 16 are near that of 35Â° for winter and  55Â° for the year.  The numbers 11 â€” 15 â€” 13 indicate the eastern border of prairies,  and the limit of the great number of plants and animals which belong  exclusively to them. It is one of the best marked of all the lines,  though_, since the settlement of the country, it has become obscured  both by the extension of forests westward and their destruction east-  ward of it. The line represents nearly its natural position. The  figures 13 â€” 23 show the northeastern border of the prairies, which is  considered pretty well established, as far as authorities examined give  any data for it. Richardson mentions their northern extremity near  Great Slave lake.  The line 13 â€” 14 â€” 22 is a good geographical boundary, and also  nearly coincides with the isothermal of summer 70Â°, though winter  seems to differ much at its two extremities. 14 â€” ^^18 is the line of  about 2,000 feet general elevation, and west of which scarcely any of  the eastern trees extend; in all not over six or eig;ht species, while, as  already stated, most of M and N is entirely woodless.  The numbers 17 â€” 18 show approximately theboundary of the trop-  ical group of animals and plants which are found on the lower Rio  Grande. On a larger map the direction of this line would be more  irregular in detail.  The numbers 18â€”19â€”16â€”21â€”22â€”23 mark the line limiting the  forests and other products of the western mountains. It will be found   FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA. 273  a very well marked, thougli irregular, boundary, and of trees only  two or three western species extend east of\" it, and as many eastern  ones westward. The general elevation of the country on this line is  from 3,000 to 4,500 feet, and the sudden change from plains to moun-  tains causes a corresponding change in climate, productions, and general  features.  The line 19 â€” 20 â€” 21 is a geographical boundary, which, from  the great elevation of the dividing ridge, and the different climates of  its opposite sides, causes a more marked limitation here than on most  of the other western mountains.  The line 24 â€” 26 â€” 25, provisionally bounding the Arizonian re-  gion, is founded chiefly on the isothermal lines. The great summer  heat of 80Â° and upwards is connected with the growth of the Cactaceae  and other peculiar plants, and the mountains between the Colorado  and Gila also have many peculiar forms even on their cool, high  summits ; and 26 â€” 20, bounding the upper Colorado valley, is the  geographical boundary of the Wasatch region on the west.  26 â€” 27 and 20 â€” 27 form the geographical boundaries of the Utah  basin; and the latter appears also to be near the summer isotherm of  75Â°. The whole of this region is more than 4,500 feet above the sea.  20 â€” 31 â€” 27 forms the northern boundary of the great Columbian  plains or Shoshonee region, and is also a well marked limit of the  continuous forests northward of it. It coincides also pretty well with  the summer temperature of 70Â° and 35Â° for winter, or 45Â° annually.  The sudden change in the surface by forests causes these isothermals  to be more abrupt than in a country uniformly bare or wooded. This  is probably the effect of increased rains, which, of course, affect other  products also. For this reason it is believed that the summer temper-  ature of about 65Â° will be found to run along the line of 13 â€” 4 â€” 23,  instead of being parallel to 70Â° on 13 â€” 14 â€” 22.  26 â€” 27 â€” 31 is the eastern limit of the continuous forests of the  Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges, and a very good natural boundary.  27 â€” 28 is the approsimate limit between W and X, and though in  reality very irregular from the rough character of the country, its  general direction is sufficiently shown. It limits the range of many  trees and other products.  A boundary probably exists between Upper and Lower California,  but cannot yet be determined naturally.  The broken lines 31 â€” 29, 21 â€” 30, 23 â€” 2, are of course merely con-  jectural, but are made to correspond to the general features of the  country as well as the direction of the isothermal lines. On the  coast at 30Â° the annual temperature is as high as 43Â° 5', corresponding  to that of tlie coast of Maine ; while what little is known of the inte-  rior shows that tliough exceedingly rugged and often inaccessible the  Yukon region possesses a good climate and a great variety of natural  products, probably comparable with Sweden and Norway. Its winters  are milder near the coast than those of Maine, though fifteen degrees  farther north.  These few notes, hastily thrown together,, will, it is hoped, make  the design intelligible, and lead others to investigate and increase our  very imperfect knowledge of animal and vegetable distribution.

GEKERAL CONCLUSIONS.  Looking now at the regions as combined in groups, we may derive  the following conclusions from the examination of the number of  species, abundance and arrangement of their trees and forests.  1st. Coming southward from the treeless Esquimaux region and  passing a certain well marked line, we suddenly find a continuous  forest, broken only where the poverty of the soil or other local causes  prevent the growth of trees. About fifteen species compose this forest,  but the prevailing forms are the Coniferae. For much interesting  detail on the influence of climate and other causes on this northern  line, as well as for evidence of its encroachment southward, I must  refer the reader to Dr. Eichardson's interesting Arctic explorations.  Passing into the Canadian region we find seventeen species of trees  suddenly added as characteristic, and towards its southern border  many of those of the Apalachian Province begin to appear. Yet the  Lacustrian Province is a well marked one, and in the grouping of its  trees differs materially from those farther south.  Too little is known of the climate,, in its interior especially, as to  the amount of rain at different seasons, to form conclusions as to its  influence on this peculiar grouping. It appears more probable that  other physical agents were the chief ones in this respect, particularly  the geographical and geological barriers which those interested may  perceive on good maps. Another affecting the western part of the  boundary will be hereafter referred to.  2d. Coming next to the Apalachian Province, and remembering  that the forests of a great part of the Alleghenies are only a south-  ward extension of those farther north, we find a vast increase in the  variety of our forest trees. In fact, looking at all its natural products  collectively, one of the most striking, as compared with the rest of  the world between the 30th and 45th degrees of north latitude, is its  richness in trees, which will compare favorably with almost any part  of the troi)ics.  It contains more than twenty species which have no representatives  in the temperate climates of the Old World, and a fjar greater number  of species of the forms found there. In fact, those trees which have  been considered characteristic of the Lacustrian Province, with perhaps  the addition of those of the Allegheny region, will fully represent all  the common trees of Europe in number of species, tliough a few  other genera must be added from other regions to give them all.  Yet with all this variety the bulk of tlie Apalachian forests is of forms  characteristic of the temperate zone. Only about twenty-three out of  one hundred and thirty-six species are broad-leaved evergreens, and  these nearly all in the two southern regions. We will hereafter see  a marked difference in another part of the continent in this respect,   FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA. 275  audi will merely allude to its connexion with, though not dependence on,  the peculiarities of our climate. We have with a tropical summer a tro-  pical variety of trees, hut chiefly of northern forms. Again, with our  arctic winters we have a group of trees, which, though of tropical forms,  are so adapted to the climate as to lose their leaves, like the northern  forms, in winter. But here, it must he distinctly understood, is no  alteration produced hy climate. The trees were made for and not by  the climate, and they keep their characteristics throughout their vÂ»'hole  range, which with some extends through a great variety of climate.  I will not stop to discuss the relations of f-pecific distinctions and ex-  ternal physical influences, assuming that the reader understands the  scientific vie^vs of the suhject. Besides the connexion between the  Avinter climate and the deciduous trees, we find a remarkable instance  of a similar character in the great forests of pines which appear in our  subtropical southern borders, and with them a cypress, chiefly a sub-  tropical form of the Coniferae, which, unlike all others, loses its leaves  in winter like northern trees. Thus, as our climate shows great ex-  tremes, so do the forms of vegetation adapted for it; and the very wide  distribution of many of these forms may be considered by some a proof  of the great past duration of the same climate, on the supposition that  each species has spread slowly from a narrow centre of creation.  Another marked climatic connexion is that of the moisture annually  deposited on this province. I need not prove to those who have  studied the suhject that this is one of the most essential elements for  the grov/th of forests of all kinds of trees. The dense growth of the-  ever-rainy tropics in some parts of the world, with the bare plains &r  deserts of other equally tropical countries which have little or no rain,  prove that heat alone has little influence. On the other hand, our  Lacustrian Province is densely wooded almost to the limits of perpetual  frost, while the Steppes of Siberia, though of similar temperature, have  little or no wood, being supplied with little moisture. Other proofs  will be referred to hereafter. But besides the total amount, the cc^ual  distribution of the rains is important, as will be seen when we speak  of regions having a dry and a wet season alternately.  V/ithout going further into this interesting subject here, 1 will say  that I believe the reader, upon close study of it, will come to the con-  <;lusion that so intimate a relation exists between the trees and the  climate of this Apalachian Province that their peculiarities always  have and always must exist together. The disadvantages we feel in  the climate are in this way compensated for, and will in time be looked  upon as among the greatest natural advantages of the country. The  midday heat, by rarefaction and evaporation, brings northward from  the Gulf its abundant moisture. After several hours or days the cold  westerly or northerly wind condenses this in rain over all that part of  the continent included in this province, and in a less amount for some  distance west and north of it. Thus in summer a continual supply is  provided, while in winter the same winds which condense the summer  rains become our most dreaded arctic blasts.  The Lacustrian Province does not derive much moisture from the  Gulf winds, but while its colder climate makes evaporation slower, it  receives a share both from its own waters and probably also from the   276 FORESTS AND TREES OF KORTH AMERICA.  Pacific, as is shown by Lieutenant Maury in his Physical Geography  of the Sea, though he makes the rains come down entirely too far to  the south in regions known to receive but little.  3. A few words on Florida will show its peculiarities in relation to  trees and climate. The trees of Georgia extend for a long distance,  some of them continuing as prevailing forms almost to its extremity.  But they are gradually replaced by more tropical species, although  where the most marked line of distinction exists is not well known.  Most of those in the special list have been yet found only on Key West,  but the examination of the almost unexplored interior, especially the  Everglades, will doubtless extend their range materially. Forty-eight  out of seventy-eight species found in it are evergreen, and all but four  of these the broad-leaved tropical forms.  Towards the middle of the State are found extensive prairies and  treeless tracts, which are evidently connected with the alternation of  wet and dry seasons, generall}'' well marked in its climate. Though  the wet season is in summer, yet the little interruption of growth by  cold at other seasons makes their dryness influential. Its effects will  be hereafter more fully alluded to.  4. Now coming to the Campestrian Province we find, as already  stated, that no new forms of trees appear, while those found rapidly  diminish and disappear towards the west. Thirteen species have not  been traced west of its eastern border ; about ninety extend pretty  far into the Texan and Illinois regions, but only five or six get across  the eastern limit oftheCamanche andDacotah regions, which, however,  receive nine or ten more from the west and north.  The Saskatcheivan region, bordering close upon the well- wooded La-  custrian Province, may have a few more eastern species, and possibly  more from the west, as there is evidence that it is better watered and  .approaches in character to the Illinois region.  It will be observed that the southeast and northeast borders of this  province form nearly a right angle with each other, and extending  east into Michigan cause a wide separation of the Lacustrian and Apa-  lachian provinces. This is one of the most well defined facts in the  distribution of trees. A careful examination of the minute land office  surveys has shov/n that the line is exceedingly distinct in Wisconsin  and Minnesota, prairies prevailing to the south of it interspersed with  -oak-openings and groves of deciduous trees along the streams, while  to the north pine and spruce forests with tamarack swamps cover the  yrhole country, having the other Canadian trees with them. This is  doubtless in great part due to the change in the character of soil and  of the underlying rocks, which retain the moisture, while it is com-  pletely drained ofP to the south. Thus we have here a distinct divi-  sion of the two eastern forest provinces, assisting to determine where  it would be eastward were it not disguised by local irregularities of  surface.  The cause of the disappearance of trees in the Campestrian Province  is, in a word, the deficient and irregular supply of moisture. I need  not enter into the proofs of this, but refer to the records of meteorolo-  gists. It is true that this does not materially affect agriculture in  the more eastern regions ; in fact, most crops will succeed better with   FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA. 277  less rain than is necessary for most trees to thrive, and in some years  there is even a greater supply of rain in the Texan and Illinois regions  than eastward. But there are years and series of years of drought,  when in tlieir natural condition the forests take fire from the slightest  cause and burn over large tracts. This was made even more general  by the Indians, but since the white settlement has in great degree  ceased and forests have been re-established. In the Apalachian re-  gion droughts have never been sufficient to keep trees from extending  themselves as soon as a forest might be partially destroyed by fire,  and thus the formation of prairies has been prevented. A consideration  of the source of the rains will explain why the limit of prairies has its  present direction. Coming north from the Gulf they are continually  carried more and more eastward by the westerly winds; and as the  greater part of the moisture is precipitated before reaching the Ohio  river, the Illinois region is deprived /or 7/ian^ years of its due share of  rains.  The Texan region lying quite west of the line of travel of those Gulf  streams has to depend on less abundant sources for its rains. Now, as  we go westward the supply rapidly diminishes until in the Camanche  and Dacotah regions it is entirely inadequate to the growth of trees as  well as of most cultivated products; and in some parts even grass and  other herbage entirely disappear over vast tracts. From the great  bend of tlie Missouri north, however, there seems to be an improve-  ment in the country. On the banks of that river, above Fort Union,  there is no long interval without trees as there is farther south on  nearly all the streams, and on the Saskatchewan there is even less.  The very porous character of the soil and underlying rocks assists  much in this aridity of the country, and we therefore find that the  line marking the junction of the carboniferous rocks of the Illinois re-  gion with the cretaceous and tertiary is a distinct limitation of many  trees.  When better known the geological character will help much in de-  fining the physical geography of the surface of this province. In  Texas the border of the Llauo Estacado coincides with that of the Ca-  manche region for a long distance. It is evidently more the reten-  tiveness of the soil than its mineral composition that affects the growth  of trees, for all soils contain more or less of their essential ingredients.  Even the saline substances, which are supposed by some to make  deserts of portions of the Great Plains, are rather the secondary effects  of the climate; for if rains were abundant these salts would become  difi\"used, and in their proper proportions enter into the structure of trees  and other plants.  It is certain, however, that even if the fires cease very few trees  will ever be made to grow in these two arid regions.  5. Coming now to what I have called the Rocky Mountain province,  we find that the relations of climate and forest characteristic both of  the Campestrian and Apalachian provinces are repeated, but com-  bined in an entirely new manner.  The high mountain ranges resemble the latter in their regular sup-  ply of rain, while near their summits the vegetation of the Athabascan  region appears either in identical or allied forms, and still higher,   278 FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA,  near the limits of perpetual snow, the Esquimmix vegeta.tion is almost  precisely copied. But, on the other hand, the lower plains present  every shade of succession, from the continuous forests of the Apa-  lachian, through the rich prairies of the Illinois, to the barren deserts  of the Camanche region. All these characteristics occur, however, in  comparatively narrow belts surrounding isolated peaks or ranges,, and  the species of trees met with are nearly all distinct from those of the  eastern provinces.  Another distinctive character is in the fact that this province receives  its rains from the west, (except, perhaps, some of the most eastern  mountain slopes and those of Arizona,) and the supply of moisture  is in direct proportion to the vicinity of any region to the Pacific, and  the obstacles between it and that reservoir. Thus the Sierra Nevada  cuts off almost all the rain from Utah, the little that reaches its eastern  part being from local evaporation and what is intercepted by the lofty  central ranges from the higher currents of tlie atmosphere.  It thus happens that no constant elevation and no similar exposure  has always the same amount of forest or other vegetation ; local cir-  cumstances make every range of mountains and every valley dilEfer  somewhat from those around it.  But, as a general fact, we find that those regions towards the no7ih  are the best supplied with moisture, and therefore best wooded â€” ex-  actly contrary to the character of those regions which receive their  moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.  Near the Mexican boundary we enter the belt of rainless regions  described by Lieutenant Maury ; and here the supply is indeed preca-  rious, though apparently more adequate to vegetation than in the  Utah region.  Although I have enumerated a long list of trees as first appearing  on this line, it is in reality, for the most part, a treeless belt. Scat-  tered individuals of numerous species occur, often limited to one nar-  row locality, as if merely outlines of more extensive forests in Mexico,  or of what were once more extensive here, and have been destroyed  by drought. Lieutenant Ives found great tracts of some of the more  common trees thus standing dry and dead, as if killed within a recent  period ; but this is not the place to discuss these apparent changes in  the climate of the country.  The higher San Francisco and other ranges seem, however, to  receive a better supply of moisture from the upper strata of the air,  while their more impervious rocks probably retain it, and their cool  summits condense around them enough moisture for the leaves of trees.  I may remark here, that it would seem as if trees, rising high above  the surface of the ground and expanding a vast evaporating surface of  leaves to the air, require a greater degree of moisture in the air than  herbaceous plants. They cannot, like the herbs of all arid regions,  dry up and die down to their roots^ to spring again with the wet sea-  son ; they must retain vitality throughout or die. This constitutes a  real physiological distinction between trees and herbs. The shrubs  which live in those arid regions, presenting less evaporating surface,  and having larger rootstocks in proportion, withstand droughts.  6. The (Jalifornian region stands alone, unless combined with the   FORESTS AND TREES OF NORTH AMERICA. 279  Teninsula by natural affinities. Its mountains essentially resemble in  climate and forest growth the Lacustrian province. Its valleys are  like the Illinois and Texan regions, with this difference : that they  have periodic dry and wet seasons, occurring at seasons opposite to  those of Florida. Connected with this and with the mildness of its  winters we again find a large proportion of broad-leaved evergreens,  several genera, as the oaks and chestnut, which are deciduous in the  east, being nearly all evergreen there. I should have mentioned that  the same is the case in Arizona, though there a climate of tropical heat  requires no interruption of vegetation.  7. The Oregon region, and those north of it, as far as known, have  very peculiar characters as well as points of resemblance to the eastern  region. The climate is mild and equable, without excessive heat or  cold, the rains abundant, and towards the coast excessive, with but  short intervals, scarcely amounting to a dry season. The forests,  while mostly composed of the northern forms of Coniferae, have also  several broad-leaved evergreen trees and shrubs, which give them  almost a tropical aspect. Both in climate and vegetation this western  coast resembles much the coast of Europe, species and genera of trees  being almost identically represented, and in about the same numbers.  On the other hand, a similar analogy exists between the Apalachiau  forests and those of China.  The marked differences in the character of the various mountains  and valleys in these western regions may in future lead to more  minute division than I have adopted, but present information does not  warrant it now. Species formerly supposed to be limited to a narrow  district have unexpectedly been found in others far distant, but of simi-  lar natural character, the intervening wide tracts being entirely des-  titute of them. Many facts go to show that the distribution of trees  and forests was once very different, and is even now constantly  changing, together with the climate; but as even the possibility of  this change is doubted by some, except with such geological convul-  sions as can upheave mountains and sink continents, we must not be  hasty in deciding the question.  It may be objected to what I have said of the connexion between  the cold winds and the constant rains of the Apalachian province  that they do not coexist in the northwestern regions, which, together,  form the Caurike Province. But there are other causes which pro-  duce the precipitation of rain there. One is the cold northivest sea-  breeze, which in winter precipitates the moisture brought by the sowf/i-  west winds ; the other is the cold air around the peaks of perpetual  snow, which in summer produces at night a downward cold current  with the same condensing effect.  Thus the snowy mountains assist to improve the climate, and inter-  cept much of the rain which, more to the north, seems to pass over  the lower mountain ranges and to reach the Lacustrian province.  Mi:ch more might be said respecting the connexions of forests and  climate, but the general and best known facts are presented so as to  lay the way for more complete observations. The provinces and  regions may be classified in the following manner as to these con-  nexions :   280 BIRDS OF NOVA SCOTIA.  A. â€” Completely wooded ; rains equally distributed and abundant. â€”  The Lacustrwn and ApalacJdan.  B. â€” Partially wooded ; rains sometimes deficient. â€” Florida, Texas ^  and Illinois regions.  C â€” Almost woodless ; rains always deficient. â€” DacotaJi, Camanche,  and Utah regions.  D. â€” Plains and valleys unwooded ; mountains wooded in propor-  tion to their moisture, which is irregularly distributed, or periodi-  cal. â€” Bochj mountain jJrovince, except Utah?  E. â€” Partially wooded ; rains periodical. â€” Cali/ornian region, and  Mexican province ?  F. â€” Nearly all densely wooded ; rains somewhat periodic, increas-  ing in amount to the north, and with elevation. â€” Caurian province.  From what examination I have been able to give the subject, I con-  clude that at least fifteen inches of rain during the groioing season is  essential to the vegetation of trees of all kinds. This, however, must  vary with the retentiveness of the soil, the rapidity of evaporation,  and the species of tree, some requiring much more than this. We  have seen that, with its abundant moisture at all seasons, the Apa-  lachian province has far the greatest number of species of trees, while  the Caurian, though with perhaps riiiore rain, unequally distributed,  lias much fewer. This is, however, connected also with its cooler  summers, and, as before remarked, we have in the east a tropical  forest with our tropical summers, in spite of arctic winters.  From an accurate determination of the range of trees much inter-  esting information on both climatic and other physical influences is  expected to be derived. At the same time the distribution of all other  plants and of animals must be studied in order to arrive at a knowl-  edge of that harmonious system which undoubtedly prevails through-  out the organic world, however obscured by the accidents of time and  of external influences. Among them all we believe that forests will  be found one of the most important, and respectfully invite the atten-  tion of the reader to its investigation.   LIST OF BIRDS OF NOVA SCOTIA.

The following additions are made in the same work by J. L. Hurdis, esq.:  Ilaliaetus leucocephaius, Syrnium nebulosum, Carduelis tristis, Larus marinus, Mergulus  alle, making an addition of 35 species. â€” Total 149.  Nearly all the species in the list are essentially those of the North American continent,  none being peculiar to the West Indies. The following are P]uropean species: Saxicola  oenanthe, Alauda arvensis, Crex pratensis, Scolopax gcdLinago. Of these the first and third have  Ijeen taken in the United States, where the others will probably yet be found. â€” Seciietaby  SiIlTIIS0NI.\\N LN.STXTUT10N.   19   290 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.  EEPORT  ON  ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.   BY M. F. DUTREZ.   Translated for the Smithsonian Institution from the Memoirs of the Eo3-al Academy of  Brussels, by Dr. L. D. Gale.  [This article is, perhaps, the best digest of the history of the observa-  tions and researches relative to the electricity of the atmosphere which  has ever been compiled, and therefore forms a proper addition to the  reports of Miiller on other parts of the general subject of electricity  which have been given in the appendix to the annual reports of the  Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-tution.]   MEMOIR ON THE ELECTRICITY OF THE AIR.  PART I.  THE MEANS USED TO JUDGE OF THE ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA WHICH TAKE  PLACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE.  On the construction of the first electrical machine the observers  were struck with the resemblance between the eifects of electricity and  those of lightning; scarcely had the first electric spark been perceived  when Wall;, Gilbert, and Grey compared its light to that of lightning.  This resemblance was still more clearly marked when the discovery of  the Leyden phial enabled philosophers to produce with electricity the  most astonishing effects of lightning. To render the identity perfect,  nothing remained but to collect the electricity which was supposed to  exist in the atmosphere. Two methods have been employed for this  purpose, one consisting of stationary apparatus, the other of movable  ones. In the former case, upright insulated rods or metallic wires,  also insulated and stretched in the air, have been used; in the latter,  kites, portable electrometers and rheometers are employed. These  diflerent articles of apparatus serve to collect the electricity of the air  in clear and cloudy weather, during fogs, rain, snow, and hail, and  finally in storms.  CHAPTER I.  OF ELECTRO-ATMOSPHERIC APPARATUS.  Â§1. 0/ s!ationar}j apparatus. â€” Stationary apparatus was especially  used in the earlier periods when atmospheric electricity engaged the  attention. To Franklin* we are indebted for the first idea, and to  Dalibard,t a French physicist for the first verification, by experiment,  * Experiments and Ohteervations on Electricity, made at Philadelphia, p. 6C; Loudon, 1769.  fid., p. 106.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTEICITY. 2S1  of what the former had conceived. His apparatus, established at  Marly-la-ville, consisted of a pointed rod of iron forty feet high, the  bottom part of which was insulated and fastened on the top of a cot-  tage. On the 10th of May, 1752, between two and three o'clock in  the afternoon, a thunder cloud having passed over the rod, it gave out  sparks, and exhibited all the other signs of an electrified conductor.  Many philosophers have experimented by means of similar appa-  ratus; some of them have insulated at greater or less heights, and in  a horizontal direction or inclining to the horizon, metallic wires,  sometimes of considerable length. To obtain strong sparks, Delor*  connected several insulated rods of iron with a conductor which he had  raised on his house. I<e Monnierf fixed on the extremity of a polo,  placed in the open air, a glass tube surmounted by a tin pipe ending  in a point, to which was fitted a slender iron wire about 300 feet long,  which, being insulated, was attached by its other end to a silk cord  stretched under a tent. In connecting this wire with several metallic  insulated pipes he obtained, with atmospheric electricity, effects not  less intense than those which are produced by the best electrical  machines. The chief difficulty of this apparatus consisted in insula-  ting properly the conductor designed to collect the electricity, and  transmitting it without sensible loss to the instrument which is to  indicate its nature and intensity. Canton| suggested insulated sup-  ports, protected from the rain by covering them with a metallic cap.  IleadÂ§ effected a more perfect insulation by placing these within an  apartment. His apparatus was composed of a pole ot fir-wood of about  thirty feet long, firmly fixed on a glass supporter covered with gum-lac  varnish, and resting on the floor of a chamber situated in the highest  story of a house. This pole passed into a hollow cylinder of wood,  which, going through the ceiling and the roof, was fastened to the  latter. To prevent the rain from falling into the chamber he attached  a large tin funnel to the pole, a little distance above the upper part  of the hollow cylinder. Copper wires, of one to two millimeters  diameter, wound around the pole, were used to conduct the electricity  into the interior of the chamber; there they were united in a single  wire ending in a metallic ball of two inches in diameter.  A more perfect insulation requires the presence of a conductor de-  signed to establish a connexion between the apparatus and the ground  in stormy weather and whenever the electricity is of great intensity.  Neglecting this precaution, Richman, professor of natural })hilosophy  at St. Petersburg, was struck by a discliarge from an insulated rod  which he had set up on his house, and was found dead by the side of  his apparatus. To prevent this catastrophe. Read placed at an inch  and a half from the knob or ball of his a})paratus a bell attached to a  metal wire in contact with the ground, and suspended a little metallic  ball by a thread of silk between the bell and the knob. This electric  chime was designed to warn the observer to be on his guard.  Â§ 2.

This kite, surmounted by a pointed iron wire,  was held by a hempen cord terminating in a thread of silk, and a key  attached between the cord and the silk thread served for a conductor,  by which the electricity, descending along the cord, might be drawn off.  This experiment was repeated in France, in a more perfect manner,  by De Eomas,t of Nerae, who furnished the cord of a paper kite, seven  feet high by three broad, with very fine metallic wire, in order to render  it a better conductor of electricity. Moreover, instead of drawing forth  the sparks with his finger, which might expose the observer himself to  the discharge, he made use of a receiver connected with the ground  by a chain. Having taken all the precautions which an enlightened  prudence could suggest, De Eomas ventured to launch forth this ap-  jDaratus, thus improved, iuto the most stormy clouds; a,nd in one of his  experiments, during a storm attended with little rain or visible light-  ning, he, for hours, continued to receive flashes or sparks of electricity  ten feet long. \"â–  Imagine to yourself,\" he wrote to the Abbe Nollet,^  \" flashes of fire nine or ten feet long, and an inch in diameter, with a  report as loud as that of a pistol. In less than an hour I had cer-  tainly thirty of these flashes, and thousands of lesser ones. But what  gave me the greatest pleasure in this new spectacle was that these  great discharges were spontaneous, and that, in spite of the abundance  of the electric fluid of which they were composed, they constantly fell  on the nearest conducting bi dy. This uniformity of result gave me  so much confidence, that I ventured to draw the fluid with my  discharger, even at the time that the storm was quite violent; and  although the glass arras of this instrument were only two feet long I  conducted where I wished, without feeling the slightest agitation in  my hand, streams of fire which were seven or eight inches in length.\"  These details show us bow great is the uanger which attend ex-  periments 'of this kind. The scientist Charles, Â§ .in order to avoid  touching the cord of the kite in letting it off, rolled it around a cylin-  der, which he turned by an insulated crank. The cylinder itself  was mounted on four pillars of glass. While he wound the cord he  established a communication between the cylinder and the ground by  means of a chain which terminated in large iron pickets buried in  the moist earth; and when the apparatus was insulated he took care  to keep himself at a greater distance than these pickets, or in general  the nearer conducting bodies, so that if a discharge should happen it  might be attracted to them. To attain the same object De Romas|!  constructed an apparatus known by the name of the electric chariot,  by means of which he could let ofi' the cord of his kite without running  any risk, even when the storm was the most violent.  Among the observers who experimented on atmospheric electricity  * Experiments and Observations on Electricity, p. 111.  f Memoires des Savants Etrang., torn. 11, p. 394, 1755.  % Memoires des h^avants' Etrang., torn.

Those which he used in his numerous experiments were  four feet long by two broad. Kites of these dimensions appeared to  him the best, because they could be managed with ease, and are suffi-  ciently large to sustain the weight of the cord at a convenient height.  Those made of cloth or tafieta he found less useful, because they needed  more wind to raise them. He discovered, also, that the best cord was  formed of two strands of hemp twisted with a copper wire.f Lastly,  he tried further to increase the conducting power of the cord by  coating it with lamp black, charcoal powder, powdered emery, or  other similar substances diffused in gum water ; but the effect was  scarcely perceptible and of slight duration, because these substances,  not sticking to the cord, were easily rubbed off. In this respect Nairne  obtained a greater effect by simply steejjing the cord in water satu-  rated with salt. In this way it became a very good conductor of elec-  tricity, on account of the diffused humidity of the air, which was  strongly attracted by the salt.  Â§ 3. 0/\" electroscopes^ electrometers j and rlieometers.X â€” To ascertain  the presence of electricity in the rods which they had raised in the  air, observers at first drew the sparks with the finger, or with some  other conducting body. When the electric tension was too feeble to  give out a spark, they placed near the rods a little saw-dust, or some  very fine down or cotton, and then observed the attraction which was  exercised on these substances. The Abbe MazeasÂ§ attempted by this  method to measure the intensity of atmospheric electricity from the  relative distances at which this attraction was manifested. These  rude and inconvenient means induced philosophers to have recourse to  other more delicate ones, especially when it became necessary to ob-  serve electricity of feeble tension, with which the electro-atmospheric  apparatus is charged in clear weatlier. As early as 1752, NoUetjfj to  attain this object, em{)loyed his electrometer composed of two simple  threads, which were separated from each other by the effect of repul-  sion when the conductor witli which they were connected was electri-  fied. He was the first who reduced the measure of the intensity of  atmospheric electricity to the observation of an angle. A little  after this Canton, T[ in his experiments^ terminated the two threads of  the French philosopher's electrometer by little balls of the pith of  elder, very nearly the same time that Franklin**, used with advantage  in the electric chime to study the electricity of the clouds.  - Traits complet. d'Electricitc^, par Tibfere Cavallo, p. 274, et suiv.

Various methods were used by the early philosophers to ascertain  the nature of the electricity with which their apparatus was charged.  Franklin* at first made use of two Leyden phials, one of which was  charged with the electricity of the rod, and the other with that of the  electrical machine. He placed them on a table at three or four inches  apart, and watched the motions of a little ball of cork suspended  between the two knobs. If, for example, the two bottles had each of  them been positively charged, the ball attracted at first and then re-  2)elled by the one was equally repelled by the other ; if, on the con-  trary, the charges were of a different kind, the little cork ball was  alternately attracted and repelled by both, and thus performed a series  of oscillations between the two knobs. To discover the nature of the  electricity with which the electrical chime of bells was charged, he  brought a glass tube positively electrified near the edge of the bell  which communicated with the rod ; in case this had negative electri-  city the ringing was stopped ; if it was positive it continued and even  became more lively. Sometimes he suspended a little ball of cork  near the edge of the same bell, and by presenting to it a glass tube  charged with electricity, he determined the kind of electricity which  the bell had communicated. Other scientists had recourse to the  various appearances which the electric light exhibited, according as  it was produced by positive or negative electricity. For this purpose Le  Eoy t placed opposite to each other, in a little box having a narrow open-  ing, two small metallic conductors, insulated and each having a blunt  point, one of which was connected with the atmospheric apparatus and  the other with the ground. In cases in which the atmospheric charged  the rod in a perceptible manner, the electricity was conducted by a  metallic wire into the inside of the box, and on looking in through a  small window two lights could be seen at the ends of the two points.  If the point connected with the rod presented a tuft or plume, and the  other a luminous star, the observer concluded that the air or cloud  was positively electrified ; if, on the contrary, the former presented  a luminous star and the latter a plume, he inferred that the elec-  tricity of the atmosphere was negative. This method was also. used  by BeccariaJ  In his numerous experiments on this subject CavalloÂ§ made use of  an electrometer, with a\" graduated dial to measure the intensity of the  electricity. He wished to determine the proportion between the inten-  sity and the corresponding divergence of the instrument. For this  purpose he gradually brought a tin plate, on which was placed a small  quantity of bran, near to a conductor connected with an electrometer,  and at the same time to the string of a kite in full flight. He found  that when the pendulum of the electrometer stopped at six degrees  the conductor began to attract the particles of bran, at the distance  of three-fifths of an inch ; and when the pendulum was at twenty de-  grees the attraction took place at an inch and a quarter ; and, finally   - Experiments and Observations on Electricity, pp. 113, 115.  f Journ. de Phys., annce 1774, p. 1.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTEIOITY. 295  that when it reached as high as thirty degrees it was manifest at  two and one-fifth inches.  When the same physicist tried experiments witli the kite during  the night, and when it was not in his power to recognize at once the  nature of the electricity, he charged a Leyden phial, which was so  constructed as to preserve its charge for hours. To effect this he  jilaced, by means of a wire, the inside lining in contact with the bottom  of a tube of glass sealed into the neck of the phial, while the rod  terminating in the knob was inserted into a second glass tube of a  narrower bore than the former one, but double its length, and cemented  in such a way that it passed in a very slight degree beyond the  lovt^est extremity of the tube. By taking hold of this latter piece in  the middle, it could be put within the tube of the phial and made to  touch with the rod or stem, the metallic wire in contact with the  lining; it could then be drawn out and the bottle lose no perceptible part  of its charge. Cavallo* assures us that he kept these phials charged  for six weeks. In other cases he fastened to the end of a fishing  rod a glass tube covered with gum-lac, at the end of which was fixed  a ball of cork, holding suspended by threads two small balls of elder  pith. He attached to this ball, by a moveable pin, one end of a  conducting wire, and taking the other end in his hand, he raised the  fishing rod outside of a window of the upper story of the house.  After having held it in this position for some time he detached the  wire by a jerk which, pulling out the pin from the ball, left it insulated  and charged with an electricity contrary to that of the air, the nature  of which was determined by drawing in the apparatus.  In 1783 Archardjt of Berlin, proposed a new electro-atmospheric  apparatus; but, notwithstanding all the care he took in its construc-  tion, it did not appear that this apjiaratus exhibited a much higher  degree of delicacy than that of the instruments we have already men-  tioned. It is principally to the perfecting of the instruments by two  illustrious philosophers, De Saussure and Volta, that electric meteor-  ology is indebted for a great number of important observations. The  first electrometer was made as early as 1749. It was constructed  by two members of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, D'Arcy and  Le Roy;;j; but its want of sensibility to the electric influence pre-  vented its adoption. We have seen above, that three years later Nol-  let proposed an electrometer, at once very simple and delicate, and  that he used it in his researches on atmospheric electricity. In 1780  CavalloÂ§ substituted for the two single threads of Nollet two delicate  metallic wires, bearing on their ends little balls of the pith of elder.  In 1784 De Saussure|| obtained one of Cavallo's electrometers, and so  improved it as to form an instrument superior in delicacy to all that  had been used before in the observation of the electrical phenomena  of the air. The electrometer of this philosopher was composed of two  very fine silver wires, each of them terminated by a little ball of the  ~ Traitfe complete!' Electric, page27G, 295.  t Nouv.

The divisions marked on the  bell served to ascertain the number of lines and fractions of lines by  which the two little pendulums diverged from each other. Four small  slips of tin foil, pasted on the inner surface of the bell, and connected  with the metallic base of the instrument, served to carry off the elec-  tricity with which the internal air became insensibly charged. In  order to determine the proportion which subsisted between each  divergence of the balls and the strength of the charge of his elec-  trometer, De Saussure* took two of these instruments, as like each  other as possible^ and after having electrified one of them so as to  of exhibit a divergence of six lines, he touched the rod or stem with that  the second ; at the instant, the electricity dividing itself equally between  the two instruments, the divergence in each of them was four lines.  From this it follows that a diminution of one-half in the intensity of  the electricity reduced the divergence but one-third. Eestoring the  second electrometer to its natural state, and placing it anew in  contact with the first, the divergence was 2.8 ; after a third contact,  not more than 1.9 lines. He thus succeeded in arranging the elements  of a table which changes with different instruments and which  every observer ought carefully to construct for himself before he com-  mences a regular series of observations.  To collect electricity De Saussuref made use, in his first experi-  ments, of a fine silver wire, from 50 to 60 feet long ; to one end of which  was fastened a ball of lead three or four ounces in weight, and its  other end was attached to a hook substituted for the ball on the stem of  the electrometer, so that it might be detached by the slightest effort.  Holding the instrument in his left hand, he cast into the air with his  right the leaden ball, which by this movement carried up the conduct-  ing wire and transmitted to the electrometer the electricity which it  acquired at its greatest height. But by the continuation of the same  movement, the wire drew on the hook, loosened it, and left the elec-  trometer charged with the electricity which it had acquired. De  Saussure foresaw an objection which might be made to this method of  observing atmospheric electricity. \" Might not the electricity,\" said  he, \" which the ball exhibits be produced by its friction with the air,  even though the air may not be charged with electricity ? To decide  this question by experiment, I attached the same ball to a cord of  silk, and I caused it to turn very quickly in the air ; but it did  not by this contract any electricity, which proves that the friction  with the air is not capable of electrifying it, and that thus the elec-  tricity which is obtained by my method really belongs to the air into-  which the ball is thrown.\"  This method has also been used by Messrs. Becquerels and Breschet, J  to approximate to an estimate of the intensity of the electricity of the  atmosphere at different heights above the ground, except they used an  arrow instead of a ball. Having ascended one of the plateaus of the   '-' Voyage dans les Alpes, torn. II, sec. 793, p. 206.  t Voyage daas les Alpes, torn. II, sec. 785, page 197.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 297  Great St. Bernard, they stretclied on the earth a piece of taffeta pre-  j^ared with gum, on which they coiled a silk tliread, covered Avith  tinsel, 2fi2 feet long. They placed one of the ends in communication  with the stem of a straw electrometer by means of a knot I'astened  loosely to it; and after having attached the otlierend to tlie iron point  of an arrow, they shot it upwards by means of a strong bent bow. The  arrow as it rose bore away the conducting thread, as in the experi-  ments of De Saussure, and separated it from the stem of the elec-  trometer. Messrs. Bccquerel and Breschet observed that the straws  of their instrument diverged gradually as the arrow rose, so as at last  to strike strongly against the sides of the bell. They also ascertained  that the electricity transmitted to the electrometer by the arrow did  not proceed from its friction against the air ; for they observed that the  experiment was unsuccessful when the arrow was shot horizontally at  three feet above the ground.  In 1785 De Saussure* added an important improvement to his at-  mospheric electrometer. Availing himself of the action which points  exercise on the electric fluid, he surmounted it with a conductor, ter-  minating in a pointy two feet long and composed of three pieces which  could be adjusted to each other. The length of two feet appeared to  him the most proper, because a longer conductor would render the  instrument much more difficult to manage without increasing its deli-  cacy. To the conductor was attached a little umbrella of very thin brass  plate, of a conical form, and four inches and a half in diameter, de-  signed to preserve the electrometer from the rain or snow. By this  addition the instrument acquired such a delicacy that the two small  balls would diverge when a stick of sealing wax that had been elec-  trified was passed rapidly over it, at a distance of fifteen or eighteen  inches.  To make his observations De Saussuref chose an open place, free  from trees and houses, and there put the plate and conductor of his  instrument into communication with the ground ; he then elevated the  point so as to bring it to the height of the eye. After having no-  ticed to how many lines the divergence of the little balls corresponded,  he slowly lowered the electrometer towards the earth, and marked  the height of the point of the conductor at the moment when the di-  vergence had entirely ceased, as the distance from the ground at which  the atmospheric electricity began to be perceptible. He regarded the  electricity as exhibiting itself at the surface of the earth, when the  electrometer without a conductor diverged when it was simply placed  on the ground. Finally, if on being placed at the height of the eye,  and consequently its point two I'eet higher â€” that is to say, seven  ieet â€” the electrometer exhibited no divergence, he raised it one or two  feet higher ; but as then he could no longer observe the balls, he  touched the bottom of the conductor with the other hand, and then  brought down the instrument near the earth to see if it was electrified.  If it was so, he concluded that the atmospheric electricity was sensible  at eight or nine feet. If it was not so, he marked in his journal 0,   '' Voyage dans les Alpes, torn. II, sec. 791, page 203, and sec. 793, page 211.  â– j- Voyage dans les Alpes, torn.

However important might be the improvements made by De Saus-  sure in Cavallo's electrometer, as applied to researches in atmospheric  electricity, still that instrument could not render very feeble degrees  of electricity perceptible. Volta conceived the idea of putting it in  communication with the condenser, and by this method he obtained a  perceptible quantity of electricity in cases where all other instruments  indicated nothing,* He also made a change in De Saussure's elec-  trometer. f He left off the balls of elder pith, and substituted for the  metallic wires two small straws suspended to very movable little me-  tallic rings_, by means of which they were fitted to the stem of the  instrument in such a manner as to be near each other in a state of  rest. These little straws which, when dry, have the advantage of  being much lighter than De Saussure's metallic wires, and presenting  for equal weights much more surface, were then enclosed in square  glass flasks, having on one side of them a scale divided into 0.5 of a  line, and designed to measure their divergence. In this manner Volta  formed electrometers, which, though differing in respect to their  sensibility, had degrees which corresponded in a given ratio for each  instrument through the whole extent of the scale. In that which was  the most delicate the straws were two inches long by the sixth of a  line broad ; and in varying their length and diameter, or in length-  ening the metallic wires by means of which they were suspended, he  obtained a second electrometer, in which a divergence of 0.5 of a line,  regarded as a degree, was equal to five degrees of the first. To render  these instruments capable of being compared, he united their stems by  a conductor, then communicated to them the same quantity of elec-  tricity, and noticed the divergences they exhibited at the same  moment. Repeating this operation a certain number of times, with  different charges, he had all the elements necessary to form a table  which allowed him to reduce the degrees of the least sensible electro-  meter to those of the one which showed the greatest sensibility.  On comparing his electrometer with that fitted with metallic wires  and balls, Volta found that in the latter the divergences were not pro-  portional to the charges, as De Saussure had observed, while in the  former, when it is perceptible or moderately so, the divergence is regular  up to 26Â°. ytill further he noticed that if the straws were equal in  length, a perceptible difterence in their size caused scarcely any differ-  ence in the variations. Thus, with straws of the same length, the sizes  of which were one-eighth and one- quarter of a line, he found but one  degree of difference in twenty. He also observed that when the straws  are less than an inch in length the electrometer exhibits no longer a  regular divergence, and finally, that the flask must not be too large,  lest the internal air should retain too long the electricity which it takes  away from the straws each moment.  * To obtain exact results by means of the condenser, M. Becquerel observes, plates of  brass should not be used, for it is impossiV)le to ji^uard ourselves against the electro-chemical  effects resulting from the action of the liquids which adhere to the fingers on the metal.  Gilded plates of copper, or rather gilded plates of glass, should be substituted.  f Diction, de Gehler, tom. Ill, p. 6G5, and Lehrbuch der Meteorologie von L. F. Koemtz,  vol.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 299  In his experiments Volta made use of the conductor with which  De Saussure had armed his electrometer, but he placed at tlie end of  the point an ignited body, such as a piece of spunk or of cotton wick  prei)ared with sulphur. By this means he obtained results which  were frequently twice as great as those afforded by the apparatus  without the use of the ignited body. As to the mode of applying the  combustible to the end of the conductor, in order that it might be  kept there the necessary time, and not be extinguished by the wind,  Volta placed it in the inside of a coil of iron, adjusted to the point of  the conductor. He advises also to attach to the same point a little  lantern containing a spirit lamp, in case the rain is such as not to  allow using simply spunk or tinder or burning sulphur.*  The great divergence which an electrometer presents when the stem  is furnished with an ignited body is worthy of observation. M. Pfafff  says that, in the case where he observed no electrical sign with an elec-  trometer of gold leaf exposed to the air, even while using a condenser,  the leaves diverged more than an inch as soon as he fitted to the point  of the stem a piece of ignited tinder. Let there be placed on an ordi-  nary electroscope a very small spirit lamp, and at five or six feet above  it present a stick of resin feebly electrified ; instantaneously there will be  seen, according to M. Pouillet,! a very great divergence of the leaves ;  and yet the same body with the same electrical charge produces no  sign of divergence if it be presented to the electroscope without flame,  even at the distance of an inch. It might be objected that the elec-  tricity which is observed in Volta's electrometer furnished with an  ignited body is not the result of the influence of atmospheric elec-  tricity, but that it is produced by the action of the flame or smoke on the  point of the conductor. This objection appears well founded, since  M. Becquerel,Â§ in causing flame to act on metallic bodies which com-  municate with a condenser, observed a disengagement of electricity,  the cause of which he attributed to an electro-motive action which  existed between the flames and these bodies. To be able to judge  how far confidence could be placed in observations made in this  manner, Bchiibler || rejicated the same experiments in the open air  and in closed rooms. During the burning in the house of three  grains of tinder or of sulphur, he could not obtain the slightest sign  of electricity with Volta's electrometer ; while the same quantity of  these substances burned in the open air, at the same hours in the after-  noon, when atmospheric electricity is at its minimum, was suificient  to charge the electrometer, or even a small Leydcn phial, to such a  degree that it could be used for other researches in electricity. He  could scarcely obtain any signs of electricity by the combustion of a  hundred grains of spunk or tinder in closed rooms. It follows, there-   ^ M. Matte nci, resting on the electric conductibility of the vapor of phosphorus, prepared  in metallic tubes sticks of tliis substance one or two niillimetr(!3 in diameter, to adapt them  tben to the point of the conductor destined to receive the atmospheric electricity. â€” (See  liiblioth.

But how does an ignited body increase the divergence of the electro-  meter if the electricity disengaged must not be attributed to an action  of the flame on the metal ? We do not know what explanation Volta  gave to this phenomena, but M. Gay Lussac* says : \" The smoke  which passes off from the tinder ignited at the point by which the  electrometers, designed to ascertain atmospheric electricity, are armed,  may exhibit an image of an electrified cloud. This smoke acts as  as a conductor, which, as it expands, collects the electricity of the air,  and renders it more sensible by accumulating it at the surface ; but  the ignited tinder acts also in another way by heating the air and  thus rendering it a conductor.\" We shall see farther on that an  electrometer becomes charged by induction and not by the contact  of the surrounding air ; consequently that its straws or leaves may  diverge as well negatively as positively in the same stratum of air.  We may conclude from this that the smoke produced by the ignited  tinder does not act as a conductor to accumulate in the electrometer  the electricity of the surrounding air, for then it would be necessary  for the instrument to take a permanent and not a transient charge.  We believe rather, with M. Gay Lussac, that the effect produced is from  the conductibility which the air acquires by heat ; for we see that the in-  tensity of the electric tension, observed in the electrometer, depends on  the effect of the conductibility of the air, this latter favoring the elec-  tric radiation of the instrument. Â§ Besides, M. Gay Lussac has demon-  strated by a very simple experiment that the air, the temperature of  which is raised, becomes a conductor of electricity. He observed that  an electrometer on being charged quickly loses its electricity when red  hot charcoal or the flame of an insulated candle is brought near it, while  it preserves its charge if the charcoal has not been heated. Thus may  be explained the fact observed by M. Mattencci,t that the discharges  of a musket, fired at the height of the flame of electrometer of Volta,  occasion a very strong divergence in the straws of that instrument.  By means of series of straw electrometers rendered capable of com-  parison by the method indicated by Volta, Schiiblerl made numerous  observations, the special object of which was to determine the pe-  riodical variations of atmospheric electricity. These instruments  were provided with metallic stems three feet long, terminating in  coils, furnished with a combustible substance ; and, like Volta, he  took for the unit of his scale 0.5 of a line. Schiibler preferred Volta's  electrometer to that of Bennet, with gold leaf, because with the former  the valuation by degrees could be made with more exactness, because  it preserved longer the electricity which had been communicated to it,  and also because it is more convenient to observe comparatively the de-  Â«â–  Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., torn.

Scliiibler has  also remarked that the electrometer is charged much more quickly  when, instead of tinder, there is fixed on the point of the stem a wick  prepared with sulphur.  The discovery of electro-magnetism having led to the construction  of the rheometer, this instrument was soon applied, in the hands  of philosophers, to ascertain the electrical phenomena of the atmos-  phere. Its first use as an electro-atmospheric apparatus was by M.  Calladon.* After having demonstrated, in 1820, that an electrical  machine might, like the pile, produce a current capable of deflecting the  magnetic needle, this scientest showed that the rheometer might be-  come a means of determining the quality of electricity which passes  into the conductors used in the researches on atmospheric electricity.  He raised on the observatory of the college of France a pole thirty-  six feet long, supporting a conducting wire covered with silk, and  terminated by two fine needles diverging a little from each other.  This wire passed through a glass tube and descended into a chamber  where two rheometers were placed with two needles, one of 100 and  the other of 500 coils, the wire of which was doubly covered with silk,  and each series of coils separated by taffeta, prepared with gum. He at-  tached the conducting wire to one end of the wire of one of these instru-  ments, while the other end communicated with the ground. By means  of this arrangement he obtained deviations of the magnetic needle,  not only during storms, but also in days when the sky was merely cloudy.  M. Peltier and M. Clarke, f of Dublin, also used this instrument with  advantage, especially for studying the distribution of the electricity  in thunder clouds. They used a rheometer of 8,000 coils, the wire of  which was covered with silk, and also with a coating of gum-lac var-  nish, which insured the best insulation.  JResearches on atmospheric electricity have also been made with  other instruments than those we have mentioned. In 1704, ReadJ  used for this purpose the electrical condenser, an apparatus described  first by Bennet, and afterwards improved by Isicholson. It was  designed, by the aid of a movable disk, to render a small portion of  electricity perceptible by increasing the quantity T)f electricity con-  tained in two other similar and opposed stationary disks. From ex-  periments with this instrument Read concluded that the atmosphere  when entirely pure is almost always in a state of positive electricity, and  that when it is vitiated, whether by putrefaction of vegetable matters or  b}' that of animal substances, its electricity becomes negative; and finally  that respiration alone renders the electricity of the air negative. These  results, obtained by means of the doubler, have not been confirmed by  experiments made with other instruments ; on the contrary, it has  been discovered that they must be attributed not to atmospheric elec-  tricity, but to other causes derived from the imperfections of the in-  strument. The use of that apparatus, therefore, has been abandoned  in all researches on electricity of this character.  In 1809 De Luc exhibited to the Royal Society of London, under the  '^ Ann.

A small pendulum set in motion  by the electricity of the column alternately struck against two metal-  lic balls, one in constant communication with the positive pole, the  other with the negative pole or with the ground. The vibrations of  this pendulum would, according to De Luc, indicate by their fre-  quency the electrical variations of the surroundicg medium or those of  the surface of the ground.\"^ But it is now known that the irregularity  of the vibrations of the pendulum cannot be regarded as an indication  of the influence of the surrounding electricity; that it is the character  of the dry pile to permit only a very gentle circulation of electricity,  and not to become recharged, except very moderately, after having  lost its electricity by the communication of its poles ; consequently,  that more or less time must pass before sufficient electricity is accumu-  lated at the two poles of such a battery to renew and continue the  movements of the pendulum. Besides, Schiiblerf examined this ques-  tion, and concluded, from a great number of observations, made under  very different circumstances, that the action of De Luc's dry pile was  subject to the influence of moisture, and not to that of atmospheric  electricity.   CHAPTER II.  OF THE USE OF ELECTRO-ATMOSPHERIC APPARATUS.  When we examine the opinions which have been advanced as to the  phenomena of atmospheric electricity^ we are struck with their want  of harmony. The mode of action of this agent on the instruments  has been variously interpreted by scientists ; and while some consider  these instruments as having been electrified by the contact of the sur-  rounding air, whoie electricity is positive, others see in the electrical  signs which are manifested only the effect of electricity of induction.  In speaking of the electrical phenomena of the atmosphere M. BiotJ  says :  \" The experiments on atmospheric electricity present the only case  of an indefinite medium, such as the air, all the molecules of which  are individually charged with an excess of electricity of the same kind  adhering to their surface; so that the whole mass of the medium be-  comes pervaded with it in proportion to the heights. The difterent  particles of this medium cannot be in repose except from the mutual  compensation of their repulsive forces, combined with their weight ;  and the same condition applies to the conducting bodies which are  immersed in it. Thus, in all bodies in the air, the electrical equilibrium  cannot take place when their natural electricities are merely neu-  Â« Bibli<;th. Biitann. Sc. et Arts, tom. XLVII, p. 213. 1811.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 303  tralized; it can only take place wlien tliey possess an excess of one or  the other electricity which is the same as that of the stratum where  they are found. If the particles possess a greater excess of this same  electricity they will act only in virtue of this excess upon each other  and upon all the molecules of the surrounding air; they must then  mutually repel each other. If, on the contrary, the excess of elec-  tricity v/hich they possess is less than that which they naturally re-  ceive in the position where they are placed, the mass of the medium  â– will act on each one of them by virtue of this diiference, and their  natural electricities will he decomposed as much as is necessary to  complete what is wanting to them of the electricity of the medium; by  virtue of this addition they repel the medium as much as the medium  repels them, and will therefore undergo no more action. But they act  on each other v/ith the excess v.^hich they have acquired from the  opposite electricity, and if the medium is an indefinite fluid composed  of particles susceptible of being electrified by contact, this excess will  by degrees be dissipated in space.\"  Experiment does not sustain this mode of regarding the action of  the electrified air on the conducting bodies which are immersed in  it; for it would follow that an electrometer ought to present almost  always a negative divergence at the instant of its exposure to the air  under a serene sky, since its leaves would act on each other with the  excess of the electricity which they had acquired by the positive influ-  ence of the stratum of the surrounding air. It would likewise follow  that if, after having freed the instrument of its negative electricity, we  should lower it or raise it suddenly the leaves would exhibit a posi-  tive divergence in the former case and a new negative divergence in  the latter. Now, experiment shows that precisely the contrary takes  place. Other phenomena, of which we shall have occasion hereafter  to speak, are equally irreconcilable with tlie principle announced by  M. Biot.  In his explanation of the formation of thunder clouds, M. Guy Lus-  sac* supposes that the electricity is diff'used in the atmosphere, and  that it exists in a free state, ready to be transferred and collected on  the conductors which are presented to it. On thiÂ« supposition the  electrometer would always take a quantity of electricity corresponding  with that existing in the air into which it is immersed ; but this elec-  tricity cannot be the cause of the positive divergence which is observed,  since the surrounding air and consequently the armatures and the  gold leaves of the instrument being then in the same degree of elec-  trical tension, there is no reason why the last acted on by equal forces  should diverge from each other. This appears from the following experi-  ment, for which we are indebted to M. Peltier. f This scientist took  a glass globe covered with tin -foil, with the exception of two small  openings opposite each other so as to see what passed within. At  the centre of this globe he placed a small electroscope, the gold leaves  of which corresponded to the visual ray, crossing the tv>^o openings ;  he then charged the globe with a considerable quantity of electricity,   Â« Ann. de Ch. ct de Phys., tome VIII, p. 163. 1818.  â– j-Obseiv. et Iiccherch.

The  effect was the same when he previously charged the electroscope with  a quantity of electricity, similar or contrary to that of the globe ; the  divergence given to the leaves was not in the least changed. The  same conclusion may be drawn from an experiment made by Mr. Far-  raday,* in which he saw no perceptible divergence in an electrometer  placed in air, which had been powerfully electrified in a small  insulated chamber, the wall of which, composed of conducting sub-  stance, communicated with a powerful electrical machine, which was  worked in an adjoining room.  DeSaussuref was the first to observe that atmospheric electroscopes  varied in their indications, according as we raise or lower the instru-  ments ; he likewise recognized in these variations all the signs of elec-  tricity of induction, and not those of the permanent electricity of con-  tact. M. Erman,! of Berlin, in prosecuting these researches with very  delicate electroscopes, concluded, from his experiments, that the varia-  tions in the nature and intensity of the electricity, manifested by these  instruments were entirely independent of the surrounding air, and  resulted from the fact that all bodies â€” even those which are absolutely  in electrical equilibrium with the earth and the air, and which cannot  consequently produce any divergence, have yet, under the influence of  the earth, atmospheres of free electricity of their own which are modi-  fied mutually by the changes produced in their removal or approach.  M. PeltierÂ§ has recently resumed the enquiry, and, while he has been  led to a new interpretation of the electrical phenomena of the atmos-  phere, he has shown, by decisive experiments, that it is by induction  solely and not by the contact of the air that the instruments become  electrified. The considerations which he adduces in support of his  opinion, and which he communicated to the Academy of Sciences,  at the sitting of February 8^ 1841, are the following :  1. If the stem of an electrometer is surmouned by a polished ball,  and the instrument is brought to an equilibrium by touching the  covering plate and the stem at the same time, we may leave it exposed  to the agitation of the air under a clear sky for hours, keeping it at  the same height, without its exhibiting the least sign of electricity.  2. If the stem ends in a point the electrometer sometimes takes a  little electricity after half an hour or more ; this time is much  shortened if the stem ends in a bundle of metallic points or in an  ignited body, as in the experiments of Volta.  3. In case the instrument gives no indication, if we raise it a few  feet, the leaves immediately diverge positively ; if, on the contrary,  it is lowered the same distance below the point of equilibrium, its  leaves diverge negatively ; and every time that it is brought to the  height of equilibrium the leaves fall to zero.  These experiments clearly demonstrate that the electricity exhibited  by the electrometer is, in fact, developed by induction ; for, if it were  otherwise, the air would communicate to this instrument when it is  * Experimental Eesearches in Electricity, eleventh series, p. 5, 1838.  t Voyage dans les Alpee, tome II. sec. 795, p. 212.

Erman* has remarked that if we cover the stem of a glass tube;  closed above, the phenomena remain the same; positive or negative  divergence shows itself equally well, according as the direction of the  motion is up or down. The same result is still obtained by placing a  second tube around the first, in order more effectually to intercept the  contact of the air. Finally, to give to this demonstration every pos-  sible accuracy, M. Peltier and M. PfafFt reproduced in a room the  same eifects as under a clear sky ; the former experimenting under  an insulated globe suspended to the ceiling, and positively electrified:  the latter, by alternately raising and lowering tlie electrometer in an  apartment, in which the upper strata of the air had been strongly  electrified by means of points communicating with the electrical  machine.  It hence follows that an insulated conductor, which has been exposed  to the air under a clear sky, is in the same state as if it had been sub-  jected to A body positively electrified ; it has consequently its natural  electricity se])arated, the negative attracted to its upper part, and the  positive repelled to its lower part. If, in this state, the lower part is for  an instant placed in connection with the ground, the positive elec-  tricity escapes and the upper part remains charged with negative  electricity; the conductor, as M. Peltier says^ is equipoised. But then  the lower part cannot receive a new positive charge, inasmuch as a  new decomposition of its natural electricities would take i)lace, which  may happen either in raising the conductor in the air or in favoring  the escape of the electricity attracted. The same extremity becomes  cliarged, on the contrary, with negative electricity, either in lowering  the conductor or in modifying the electrical induction to which it is  subjected ; such is the natural consequence of the facts which we have  related above. If the application be made to electro-atmospheric  apparatus, we see that all such apparatus show the great inconve-  nience of indicating the differences of one and the same state, and not  of absolute quantities, as in other instruments of meteorology like  the thermometer and the barometer ; they establish and measure only  the changes which occur in their electric state, as they recede from  tlie normal condition, which is that of equilibrium.  From the preceding considerations, it is easy to give a reason for  what takes ])lace in the electro-atmospheric apparatus, and to see  how their indications may be interpreted. A stationary apparatus  may be compared to an insulated conductor which is in equilibrium ;  it cannot, on account of its immovableness, afford signs of electricity  at its lower end, except by the radiation of the electricity wbich is has  previously attracted, an eftect which takes place, slowly if the air is  <lry, and rapidly if it is moist or becomes a conductor by any means  whatever. This radiation will be promoted also if the apparatus is  subjected to the influence of a cloud powerfully electrified, or if it has  considerable length; for in this latter case its extent may make up for  the weakness of the local radiation produced by the conductibility of  'â– 5 Jouin. de Phys., torn. LIX, p. 100. 1S04.  f Dictionn. de Gehler, tome YI, p. 507.  20   306 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITy.  the air. From this it follows that, however decided may be the signs  of electricity which stationary apparatus exhibits at the approach of  certain clouds and at the beginning of rain, they usually disappear  when the sky is clear or more or less free from clouds. This apparatus  is then insufficient to study atmospheric electricity in clear weather ;  it can only show the existence of this electricity. Besides, in the case  where the radiation is active, they must frequently furnish uncertain  results, because the insulation of their supports, besides the difficulty  of rendering it perfect, varies with the hygrometrical state of the  air, the dust which settles on them, and a multitude of other secondary  causes.  Beccaria, who devised a great many contrivances, avows that fre-  quently he was ignorant whether the absence of the electrical signs  proceeded from the fact that the air was deprived of electricity, or  because the humidity had destroyed the insulation.  Another cause of error, to which M. Peltier* first called attention,  is found in the chemical action which the moisture exercise on the  wire or the oxydizable points of the apparatus. This scientist states  that among the apparatus which he set up he found one which con-  stantly gave an electrical current, because it was formed of a rod of  iron painted with oil. In moist weather the needle of a rhtometer  was deflected to 80Â° without there being any electrical action of the  atmosphere. It was to avoid this great inconvenience that M. Peltier  constructed of platina the parts of his apparatus which must remain  â– exposed to the action of the air. We may also remark that there are  multitudes of cases where the use of stationary apparatus mast be  difficult, as when we attempt to study atmospheric electricity on  mountains, in open sea, and generally in places where there are no  buildings. Perhaps, then, we might use the apparatus recommended  by M. Pfaff.t consisting of a long glass support, sustained by three  feet, and bearing a disk of wood, with which is connected, by means  of a hinge, a metallic stem composed of several pieces fitted to each  other. This apparatus may be placed in the open air in such a way  that its stem^ movable on its hinge, may take any desired inclination.  A simple metallic wire communicating with the stem serves to con-  duct the electricity to an electrometer.  If the stationary apparatus is not well adapted to ascertain atmos-  pheric electricity in clear weather, it may still be very useful to  establish the electrical state of the clouds, especially in stormy  weather, provided care be taken to connect it at the same time with a  discharging conductor. In these circumstances, M. Peltier| made use  of a simple insulated copper wire, of about a hundredth ot an inch in  diameter, which was raised at one of its ends to about eighty feet above  the ground, and at the other plunged into a well forty feet deep. This  wire, wound with silk and covered with many coats of thick varnish, was  terminated above by a tuft of platina wire ; and the lower end, which  was plunged into the well, was also terminated by a wire of the same  metal. Towards the middle of the wire was interposed a rheometer  * Ann. de Ch. et Phys., 3d series, torn. IV, page 414. 1842.  t Dictionn. de Gehler, torn. VI, page 517.  I Comptes Rendus, ttm.

The  electricity which descends along this wire being always of the same  nature with that of the cloud, we ascertain the cliaracter of the one  by observing that of the other. It was with a similar apparatus, well  insulated and protected as far as possible from the ch'anical action  of moisture, that M. Peltier made numerous and important observa-  tions on the electrical phenomena which take place during storms.  We might accomplish the same object by the use of the kite, as  many observers have done ; but, as we have seen, the danger of this  movable apparatus in stormy weather is so great that prudence alone  ought to forbid its use in this case. Besides, the facts which it fur-  nishes can be obtained, as it appears to me, equallj^ well by the use of  stationary apparatus. For in the great number of cases, not to say  all, the kite can only be influenced by the lower clouds ; we can  ascertain nothing respecting the ranges lying above these clouds, or  discover what belongs to each one of them, and thus furnish the  means necessary to an analysis of the different phenomena which  concur in the formation of storms. We believe that an insulated wire,  arranged like that which M. Peltier used, and affording all possible  security, will accomplish the same object much more conveniently.  But if the use of the kite possesses little advantage in stormy  weather, it is not so when we use it in clear weather. It may then  render eminent service to science, and it was by means of it that  De Romas, Beccaria, Cavallo, and many other observers ascertained  the fact that the influence of atmospheric electricity increases in pro-  portion to the distance from the surface of the earth. It furnishes  a simple means of determining the law according to which this in-  crease takes place, a law which is not yet known, but which evidently  depends on the want of conductibility of the constituent parts of the  air, and must consequently vary on account of the vapor which rises  from the ground, or which settles on the earth. M. Peltier* has suc-  cessfully used the kite to accomplish this object. He ascertained  the height to which it ascended by employing an insulated drum,  around which the metallic wire was coiled, and furnished with an  index which constantly showed the length of wire given out. If we  would ascertain the height, let the cord be the hypothenuse of a  right-angled triangle, of which one of the sides is the perpendicular  height of the kite. If we wish to examine atmospheric electricty  at very great heights, we may make use of a series of kites of dif-  ferent sizes. t We first allow the largest sized kite to reach its great-  est height ; then, having attached its string to a second, but of less  size, we let it likewise ascend, its string being in its turn connected  to a third, and so on. This union of kites was used for the first time  by \\Vilson| when engaged in his researches on the temperature of  elevated strata of air in 1749. The height to which the first kite  thus reached was very remarkable, since it could be frequently seen to  '^ Comptes Rendus, tome X, page 712, 1840.  f In bis experiments on atmos[)heric electricity, Cuthherison made use of tlirec kites com-  bined in tins manner, and the cords of whicb presented an entire length of 1,500 feet.

We can in this way examine the state of  very high clouds, the electricity of which would be too feeble to act  in a sensible manner on apparatus placed at the surface of the earth.  In reference to the great utility of the kite in researches on at-  mospheric electricity, it is necessary to take into consideration the  inconvenience of not being able to use it except during winds. In  calm weather we might substitute for it a balloon furnished with the  necessary additions, and retained by a cord which is a good conductor  of electricity. But this method of experimenting is much less simple,  because we can not always procure hydrogen gas, and because the  lateral currents bear the balloon to the leeward and prevent its rising  perpendicularly. We should also mention certain effects obtained by  the use of the kite, and which do not appear to be owing to the influ-  ence of atmospheric electricity, but to the induction of an electric cur-  rent on itself. It is well known that Mr. Henry,* [now Secretary of  the ^Smithsonian Institution,] has shown that a discharge of ordinary  electricity produces a powerful secondary current in the wire adjoining;  he thinks that ordinary electricity ought to produce an analogous  effect in the same wire when the discharge takes place ; and gives on  this subject the following experiment made on atmospheric electricity,  in 1836, by a committee of the Franklin Institute of Pennsylvania :  Two kites had been attached and raised with an iron wire in place of  cord ; tbe wire extended for the length of about a mile. The weather  was perfectly clear, and yet sparks drawn from the wire were of such  great pungency that fifteen persons joining their hands, and standing  on the ground, received the shock at the same moment that the first  touched the wire. On holding a leyden phial by its external coating,  and presenting the knob to the wire, a very strong shock was received  which was nothing but the result of an action of sudden and powerful  induction. According to Mr. Henry, these eftecls must not be at-  tributed to the electricity accumulated at the ends of the wire, for it  was necessary to approach the finger to about one-fitth of an inch before  receiving the spark ; he adds that we cannot attribute them to  quantity only, since Wilson's experiments have proved we cannot  produce the same .effect with an equal amount of electricity diffused  over the surface of a great conductor ; he concluded, therefore, that  the effect observed was owing to an induction of the current on itself.  The wire containing a considerable quantity of electricity of feeble  tension, which passed in the form of a current, it produced an induc-  tion at the end of the discharge, as in the case in which a long wire  transmits a voltaic current. To the same cause must be attributed  the remarkably pungency of the sparks, though very small, which are  received from a long conductor along which a feeble current of ordi-  nary electricity passes.  The electro-atmospheric apparatus acquires great sensibility when  the insulated conductor is movable. De Saussuref states that he  obtained signs of electricity when he raised his electrometer, furnished  * Contributions to Electricity and Magnetism, page 47. â€” From the Transactions of tlie  American Philosophical Society, vol. YI.  t Voyages dans les Alpes, tom. II, Â§ 799, p. 218.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 309  witli a point, only from four to seven feet above the ground, at the  time when stationary conductors of more than a hundred feet high  gave no indication. What we have given above furnishes a sufficient  explanation of this fact ; for the movable apparatus being under the  influence of an electricity which acts on them by induction, the elec-  trical equilibrium must be disturbed at every change of elevation.  Besides this, the stationary apparatus, as we have seen, however care-  fully constructed, loses in part its isolation when the air is moist, during  fogs, heavy dews, cold and rainy nights ; while a movable apparatus,  such as an electrometer furnished with a point, which we usually keep  in the house, and which is not exposed to tlie air except at the moment  when we wish to use it, always has a sufficiently good insulation.  This kind of apparatus is the only one which has yet led to any definite  results in regular observations, made under a clear sky, at the sur-  face of the earth.  There are two ways of using the electrometer, affording different  indications, and which we shoukl be careful not to confound. If v/e  desire only to know the nature of the electrical influence, whether  under a clear sky or a cloudy one, let the conducting stem be termi-  nated by one or several points, or by an ignited body; the leaves,  after having been brought to an equilibrium, will slowly or rapidly  diverge by the repelling electricity without the necessity of moving  the instrument. But the electricity thus collected being wholly de-  pendent on the conductibility of the air, and consequently varying with  the moisture in that medium, the rain and even with the force of the  wind, this mode of experimenting will simply give the measure of the  repulsive electricity which the instrument is in a state to preserve in  consequence of its insulation, and not that of the electric induction to  which it is subjected. To obtain this latter, M. Peltier* directs that  the conducting stem be terminated by a ball, v/hich, at the same  time that it prevents the radiation of the electricity accumulated at  the lower extremity, increases the effect of the induction. It is clear  that, after having brought the instrument to an equilibrium at a cer-  tain height, the indications which it will give by its elevation or its  depression will depend only on the induction of the atmospheric elec-  tricity, and may consequently be used as a measure of it. This  method is that which M. Peltier used in his regular observations, and  it appears to be the only one suitable to ascertain the variety of the  electrical tensions at short intervals of time. When this scientist  wished to make an observation he ascended on a terrace and placed  his electrometer on a tablet raised about five feet ; he brought it then  to an equilibrium by touching the stem and the lower part with a  metallic wire ; then he descended into a room below the terrace, and  there placed the instrument charged with electricity opposite to that  of the atmosphere on a tablet designed for it, where he afterwards  read it. This series of operations could be made with such rapidity  that it required only eight seconds. .  M. Peltier remarked that for these experiments he needed only to  use a ball of about three inches in diameter, and not a longer stem   Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 3<1 scries, torn. IV, p. 400, et suiv.   310 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTEICITY.  of the electrometer than twenty inches; he preferred even one of from  twelve to sixteen inches. A longer rod diminished the sensibility of  the instrument, because the electricity driven to the upper extremity  leaves to the opposite electricity the remainder of the length over which  it is to be distributed. Consequently the longer the stem the less is  the electricity which reaches the gold leaves.  Instead of raising the instrument, he prefers to lower it below the  point of equilibrium, because it is not convenient, and frequently it is  even impossible to read exactly the number of degrees which the  apparatus indicates while the air is charged with resinous vapors,  when it is necessary to raise it one or two metres above the same point.  M. Peltier remarked, however, that the divergence of the leaves or the  deviation of the needle of his electrometer is less on lowering the  instrument than on raising it; so that we ought to fix the proportion  in order to establish the direct tension in the formation of the tables  which it may be desirable to prepare. The reading was made in a  room, and not in the open air, to avoid the inconveniences of the  â– wind, rain, the heat of the sun, and especially the error which may  result from the electric tension which the head of the observer receives  in the open air, and which might act on the instrument and compli-  cate its indications. Finally, to avoid alike the induction of the hand  on the stem, this is touched in the lowest part with a fine metallic  wire.  Besides electrometers, science also has rheometers to measure the  intensity of atmospheric electricity; but, as M. Peltier* remarks,  two things limit the use that can be made of them. First, a great  quantity of electricity in motion is necessary to produce deviation in a  rheometer, while a small portion is sufficient to determine the di-  vergence of the gold leaves of an electrometer. M. Peltierf proved  that the escape of a quantity of electricity, representtd by a devia-  tion of 7.069 degrees of his static electrometer, was needed to produce  a single degree of deviation in an excellent rheometer of 3,000 coils  of a wire of 0.15 millimetres, having a system of light needles of  five centimetres in length. Then, also, it was necessary for the devi-  ation of this instrument to apply a continued current, and not a succes-  sion of small discharges. It therefore follows that the rheometer gives  no indication during the dryest and most electric days, if the extremity  of the wire is not raised to a great height in the air, while in the  last case the electrometer exhibits a very powerful electricity. Thus  it is that M. Peltier observed in his experiments under a clear sky,  that the deviation of his rheometer did not begin to be produced till  the kite with which one of the ends of the wire of the instrument  was connected had reached the height of one hundred feet above the  ground, while his electrometer indicated an increasing positive elec-  tricity beginning from the height of ten iieet.  If the rheometer gives no indication under a clear sky, when the  extremity of the wire is placed. at a small height above the ground,  it is not so when clouds and especially thunder gusts pass over the  â€¢â– â€¢â–  Comptes Eendus, torn.

In this case the radiation from the wire raised into the at-  mosphere may become so considerable that the needle moves rapidly  and even reaches its maximum of deviation.  We shall finish this first part of the general subject by a succinct  summary of what we have said of the use of electro-atmospheric appa-  ratus :  1. The electro-atmospheric apparatus becomes electrified by induc-  tion and not by contact of the air. It acts in the same way as if it  were placed under a body positively electrified ; consequently, it does  not indicate the absolute quantities, but the differences of one and the  same state.  2. Stationary apparatus, on account of their immobility, must be con-  sidered as conductors in equilibrium ; they are insufficient for the study  of atmospheric electricity under a clear sky and in a dry time ; they  do not become electrified, except by their radiation, and even then  they do not indicate the nature of the electricity, except when their  insulation is perfect, and they are not influenced by electric currents  proceeding from the chemical action of the steam upon the oxydizable  j^arts whicli enter into their composition.  3. Stationary apparatus in which the two conditions mentioned just  above are fulfilled is very well suited to observe the sudden or gra-  dual changes which take place in atmospheric electricity, during  stormSj and in general under the influence of clouds sufficiently elec-  trified. An insulated copper wire, covered with silk thickly varnished,  terminated at the end in j)latina, and arranged in the manner indicated  by M. Peltier, appears to be best suited to this case.  4. Prudence alone should prevent the use of kites in stormy weather.  When the sky is more or less clear, this movable apparatus may serve  to study the variations which occur in the induction of atmospheric  electricity, when the kite is raised from the surface of the earth towards  the upj)er regions of the atmosphere.  5. We may obtain under a clear sky remarkable effects, such as  very powerful shocks, by means of the kite, which, according to Mr.  Henry, we must attribute not to the direct influence of atmospheric  electricity, but to the phenomena of induction of an electric current on  itself.  6. When it is desired by a series of observations to measure the  variations of atmospheric electricity, and obtain comparative results,  the electrometer t'urni.shed with a stem terminated in a ball, appears  to be the only suitable instrument. We put it carefnlly in equilibrium,  at a definite height, and then lower or raise it a constant distance.  Its indications may then serve to measure the atmospheric electricity.  7. If the stem of the electrometer is terminated by one or several  points, or by an ignited body the instrument furnishes indications  which are dependent on the conductibility, or in other words on the  moisture of the surrounding air,  8. The rheometers are not deflected, except by a continued current of  electricity, and their sensibility is far inferior to that of the electro-  meters. They are very useful in stormy weather and at all times  when the influence of atmospheric electricity is very strong.   312 ATMOSPHEEIG ELECTEICITT.  PART II.  OF THE STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THE AIR.  CHAPTER I.  OF THE ORIGIN OF ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICTTY,  In the month of July, 1752, Cassini de Thnry * observed that a rod  placed on the observatory of Paris became electrified when there was no  appearance of a thunder cloud above the horizon ; but at this period it  was believed that such clouds were necessary to the production of this  penomenon, and this led him to suspect that there was a cloud near the  horizon, which, without being perceived, communicated to the air elec-  tricity enough to charge the insulated conductor. In the meantime the  observations made by Le Monniert soon left no doubt that the elec-  tro-atmospheric apparatus does become electric under a clear sky.  During a drought of six weeks, from the middle of September to the  end of October, 1752, this scientist found that the apparatus which he  had established in his garden of St. Germain en Laye, became sensibly  electrified, tlumgh the clearness of the sky was not disturbed by clouds  during all this time. The experiments of Beccaria, Cavallo, and  especially those made with the most delicate instruments by De Saus-  sure, Volta, and Schiibler, confirm this result. These philosophers  took pains to determine the character of atmospheric electricity, and  i'rom the sum of their observations we may conclude that in clear  weather the atmosphere is always positively electrified.  Many hypotheses have been framed to account for atmospheric elec-  tricity. We shall present a brief exposition of some of these and show  how far they correspond with the present state of the science.  When friction was the only known agent capable of producing the  decomposition of the electric fluids, it was natural to seek the source  of atmospheric electricity in the friction of the air against the clouds  and the earth and against itself. This opinion was entertained by  Nollet| and adopted by many philosophers; but it was afterwards  entirely abandoned, when observation taught that there was no rela-  tion between the intensity of electricity and the force of the wind.  Friction is no doubt a most active means of developing electricity ;  we know likewise from the experiments of Wilson that the air be-  comes electrified by its friction against glass. It is then probable  enough, as M. Koemtz Â§ observes, that the friction of the air against  the clouds and the earth develo2)S electricity ; but it may not pro-  duce any sensible effect, either on account of its want of intensity or  because it is immediately dissipated by the ways of escape offered to it.  [Faraday found no electrical excitement from the friction of dry air.]  * Uistoire de 1' Academic des Sciences de Paris, pour 1752, page 10.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 313  Other philosophers have limited themselves to simple conjectures.  In a memoir containinc^ his observations on atmospheric electricity,  Canton* threw out in advance this question : Might not suddenly rari-  fied air impart electricity to clouds and vapors,, and would not condensed  air produce a similar effect? Priestleyf inquired if the empty space  which is above the clouds might not always have an electricity opposed  to that of the earth? May not thunder and earthquakes, he adds, be  owing to a re-establishment of the equilibrium between the two elec-  tricities ?  According to Beccaria,;}: electricity proceeds from tlie earth wherever  the ground is surcharged, bearing with it the light bodies which may  facilitate its passage. These bodies thus assist in transferring to tlie  atmosphere the electricity of the earth.  FranklinÂ§ considered the sea as the source of lightning, founding his  opinion on the light which it exhibits at night on the slightest agita-  tion. In his view, the particles of water are so many little solid spheres,  which only touch the salt in some points, and he supposes there exists  between these particles and those of salt, the same friction there is  between the glass and the cusiiion of the electrical machine ; so that a  particle of water at the surface, being surrounded by an electric atmos-  phere, is repelled, and conveys to the air the electricity with which it  is charged.  It was in the evaporation of water at the surface of the earth that  Volta|l sought for the cause of atmospheric electricity. According to  this celebrated scientist a body on being reduced to vapor acquires  a greater capacity for electricity as well as for caloric. In the case of  water, the vapor in forming absorbs positive electricity and renders  it latent, while the water becomes negatively electriiied. When this  vapor again condenses in the colder strata of air which it meets as it  it rises, its electricity is disengaged, and the feeble conductibility of the  air would prevent its return to the earth, from which it originated, if it  were not for rain, snow, hail, or violent discharges. This theory,  which was likewise adopted by Saussure,Tf is based, first, on the pro-  duction of electricity in the passage of a body from one state to  another. Second, on the preservation of the same quantity of electricity  in a latent state by the body as long as the molecules of the latter  continue in the same state of aggregation. Volta sought to verify by  experiment the first of the above suppositions. Placing in com-  munication with its condenser a metallic vase,** in which he caused  water to be evaporated, he obtained, in concert with Lavoisier and  * Transactions I'hilosophiquos, tome XLVIII, Ist part, page 357, 1753.  f Historie de Electricite, tome III, page 32.  t Lettcre dell' Electricismo, page 2()2.

See the historical eulogy on Volta by M. Arago,  Annales de Chemie et do Physique, vol. 44, page 396. Wo may observe that attempts  had already been previously made in England to ascertain whether evaporation contributes  to the production of electricity. We find in the 3dv(dume of the History of Electricity by  Priestley, page 440, that this philosopher placed a small quauuty of water on a small bit of  glass and made it evaporate rapidly by means of a red-hot iron which he held under it. He did  not notice that the glass acquired any sensible degree of electricity.   314 ATMOSPHEEIC ELECTRICITY.  La Place, manifest signs of negative electricity. But as these illus-  trious philosophers carried on their experiments in metallic vessels  which were aifected by water; the results at which they arrived could  not lead them to the truth, since they knew not that the slightest  chemical action produces electrical effects; they therefore attributed to  the change in the molecular state of bodies that which ought to have  been referred to the combination of the same bodies with other elements.  Hence resulted the frequent contradictions which De Saussure* obtained  in repeating this experiment. When he caused water to be evaporated  in an iron crucible his electrometer was electrified, sometimes posi-  tively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes even remained without  presenting any signs of electricity.  Science possesses facts which philosphers have cited in support of the  opinion that there is a disengagement of electricity on the change of  state of bodies. Wilke observed that certain bodies, like sulphur,  wax, &c., poured into glass vases, where they were left to cool, exhibit  when they are withdrawn, strong negative electricity, while the glass  exhibits positive electricity of equal intensity. But if the change of  state were the true cause of this phenomenon, ought it not to produce  electricity in the solidifying of any body whatever ? Now this does  not take place. M. Gay Lussacf ascertained that the adhesion of bodies  and their separation by the inequality of their contraction, as is the case  of sulphur and glass, wax and glass, &c., are indispensable condition  for obtaining electricity after the fusion and solidifying of a body. The  electricity observed in this case must then be attributed to another cause  than the change of state, which appears to reside in the pressure which  the two bodies exert on each other. The electrical state of steam at the  moment it comes out of a boiler has been cited as favorable to Volta's  theory. I But, though the disengagement of electricity is in this case  unquestionable, still it is very difficult to attribute it to the evapora-  tion of the water, since it is only at the instant of the expansion of  the steam that the electricity is exhibited. Must we not rather refer  this phenomenon to the expansion, or to -some circumstance which  accompanies it, such as the diminution of the pressure of the steam  against the sides of the boiler ? This latter opinion is strengthened  by the fact that jets of atmospheric air act precisely in the same manner  as those of steam. If we compress air in a vessel, such as the recepta-  cle of a portable fountain, and then let it quickly pass off in a jet,  we observe that an electrometer which is exposed to the current of air  becomes positively electrified, while the vessel, if it be insulated, shows  signs of negative electricity. Â§ Possibly it may be the same cause which  produces the electricity which M. Mitchell oljserved during the solidi-  fying of carbonic acid. This physisist informs us that when the acid  becomes liquid by pressure and esca})es from the vessel which contains  it, the solid which it forms receives positive and the receptacle nega-  tive electricity. [This article was written before the publication of the  researches of Faraday on the electricity of steam, which conclusively  prove that the excitement is due to the friction of the particles of water,  '' Voyages dans les Alpes, touie II. sec. 807, page 228, et suiv.  f Annales de Chimie et de Physique, tome VIII, p. 161, 1818.  lAnnales de Chimie et de Physique, tome VIII, p. 161, 1818.  ^PhUos.

This is in accordance with  the experiment ot De Saussure mentioned at page 296 of tliis article.]  Atmospheric electricity being very weak before the formation of a  storm, and rapidly attaining its maximum in the thunder-cloud, Volta  concluded that the vapors which rise in the air have their electricity  latent and set it free on their condensation. But nothing appears to  authorize the admission that one of the electricities can be rendered  latent, without the presence of the contrary, and that the one can  exist insulated without the other ; for it is an undoubted principle  that, whenever electricity is produced, its positive and its negative states  exhibit themselves simultaneously with the same intensity. These  considerations appear to us sufficient to prove that Yolta's theory cannot  be admitted in the present state of science.  The question as to the origin of atmospheric electricity has also been  the object of M. Pouillet's researches. This philosopher found, by  numerous experiments, that simple evaporation produced in a pla-  tina crucible, whether slowly or rapidly, never disengages electri-  city when it is not accompanied by chemical action ; but that it  always produces electricity when the water which is evaporated holds  in solution gases, acids, or salts. In this case the steam takes the  positive electricity, and the solution the negative. He observed the  same phenomena with solutions of alkalies ; but the steam then took  the negative electricity, and the alkali the positive.* Applying  these results to the evaporation which takes place constantly at the  surface of the earth, M. Pouillet remarked that the waters of the sea,  and, in geaeral, those which plants imbibe and those which moisten  the surface of the ground, always hold in solution foreign substan-  ces, which they leave behind; and hence at the surface of the earth  there is no evaporation M'ithout there being, at the same time, chem-  ical segregation, and consequently the production of electricity. He  also believed that it followed, from his experiments, that all the vapors  which form at the surface of the earth are brought into an electric  state, not by evaporation, as Volta supposes, but because the water, in  being evaporated, leaves the foreign substances which it held in solu-  tion. This may be, according to that philosopher, one of the causes  of the positive electricity which is observed in the air in clear weather.  M. Peltier,! from similar experiments, arrived at a different conclu-  sion. He showed that, in the evaporation of saline solutions, we only  obtain signs of electricity in the case of a rapid segregation of the  dissolved body, produced by the action of the elevated temperature of  *See the Journal L'Institut of October 21, 18-11, No. 403.  tM. PouiUet made use of a platina crucible in order to remove the cruises which might  produce electro-chemical effects. This crucible, brought successively to various tempera-  tures, was placed on a disk, or metallic ring connected by a brass stem with the lower plate  of a gold-leaf condenser. See his Memoir, Annales de Cliimie et de Physique, torn.  XXXVI, p. 5. 1827.  ijlConiptts Picndus, torn. II, p. 908, 1840 ; and Annales de Chimie et de Physique, torn.

Peltier made his experiments.   316 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.  the sides of t\"he vessel in which the evaporation takes place ; and that, in  all other circumstances, we do not observe a trace of electricity what-  ever may be the quantity of vapor produced. Thus, in evaporating in  a capsule of platina heated and connected with its electrometer a drop  of a solution of sea water partly saturated, M. Peltier found that there  is rarely a sign of electricity in the first experiment ; but, if we re-  commence without having cleansed the platina, the saline layer left by  the first drop being taken up by the second, and saturating it in a  higher degree, the latter becomes nearly opake when it is reduced to  a third of its volume. We then see a multitude of^ little bodies  swimming in it, and, soon after, we hear decrepitations attended with  saline projections which at the same instant produce in the electrome-  ter a negative deviation. If the platina is sufficiently cooled to admit  of being moistened, the decrepitation ceases, the drop extends and is  at once reduced to vapor. Now, M. Peltier observed that this sudden  eva^^oration, instead of increasing the electrical deviation, took away  a part or the whole of what had been produced during the decrepitation.  A third experiment produces a yet greater effect ; the decrepitation  is stronger and the needle forcibly deflected by the intensity of the  manifestation.  It follows, therefore, that evaporation is only an adjunct in the elec-  trical excitement, and that the electricity is due to the chemical  decomposition of the hydrated molecules which adhere to the metal  possessing a high temperature. Thus M. Peltier obtained the same  result by substituting ibr salt water sea salt itself; this latter decrepi-  tating without any aqueous fusion, the water between the molecules  performing the part of the saturated solution, caused the needle of  the electrometer to move. If, on the contrary, we use a salt that is  unaffected by heat, and nearly insoluble, such as the carbonate of  barytes, there is no electricity produced, either with or without water.  Thus it appears that it is at the very moment of the separation of the  combined molecules of water that the electricity is produced, and not  during the evaporation of the superfluous water, as M. Pouillet believed.  When this separation takes place slowly, an electric neutralization  is produced before the molecules of vapor are sufficiently separated  from the liquid to retain the electricity which they had at the moment  of their formation ; while the sudden explosions produce the isolation  necessary to the preservation of the electricity developed. We know,  in fact, that when the two electric fluids are separated from each other  simply by chemical action, they always tend to unite again to form a  neutral state, through the conducting bodies which are present.  The difference between the results^ to which M. Pouillet and M. Pel-  tier arrived may be exjdained, perhaps, by that of the instruments  which these two philosophers employed. The first used a condenser of  gold leaf; he observed no signs of electricity except at the instant of  the separation of the plates of the instrument ; and the electricity  which it then indicated was that which, being produced during the  decrepitation of the substances used, had remained disguised by the  opposite electricity of the upper plate. M. Peltier appears to have  made his experiments with his electrometer without a condenser. By   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 317  this instrument as he was able to seize the instant when the electrici-  ties were set free, when the disengagement ceased, and to follow step  Ly step the phases of the phenomena, he could thus distinguish what  was owing to chemical action, produced by the high temperature, from  that which was due to simple evaporation.  M. Pouillet* pointed out another source of atmospheric electricity in  the act of vegetation. He had established, by a series of previous  experiments, that gases give off electricity when they combine either  together or with solid or liquid bodies ; that in these combinations,  oxygen disengages positive electricity, and the combustible body, what-  ever it may be, negative electricity ; and that reciprocally, when a com-  pound is decomposed, tach of the elements then wanting the electricity,  which it has disengaged, is found in an opposite electrical state. Thus  when oxygen combines with carbon, the carbonic acid which is formed  is positively electrified, while the carbon remaining becomes negatively  electrified. We may verify this phenomenon by j)lacing a cylinder of  charcoal perpendicularly, at about a foot below a metallic plate, con-  nected Avith the upper disk of a condenser with plates of gold, and  having placed its lower portion in connexion with the ground, then  igniting the upi3er part of it, a column of carbonic acid gas imme-  diately rises, and transmits to the upper plate an excess of positive  electricity.  But we know that different parts of plants act on atmospheric air ;  that sometimes they form, at the expense of the oxygen_, quite a large  quantity of carbonic acid, Avhich escapes insensibly, and that sometimes  they exhale pure oxygen, arising from some combination in the in-  terior of the plant. JNow, if it be true, says M. Pouillet, that carbonic  acid is positively electrified at the moment of its formation, it follows  that plants ought to yield to the air, by the exhalation of that acid,  a greater or less quantity of positive electricity. This scientist at-  tempted to verify his conclusion directly by experiment. If the hypo-  thesis be true, the plant ought to take the negative electricity, and M.  Pouillet obtained, in fact, in the day as well as at night, signs of nega-  tative electricity, by germinating grains in glass capsules, varnished  on the outside, which were connected together by metallic wires and  at the same time with the lower plate of a condenser, while the upper  plate was in communication with the ground. Thus he thought he  might conclude from liis experiments that on a surface, in full vegeta-  tion of one hundred metres square, there was eliminated in one day  more positive electricity than was necessary to charge the strongest  battery.  Many philosophers have believed that the effect obtained by M.  Pouillet cannot be attributed to the combination of the oxygen of the  air witli the carbon of tlie plant, since this phenomenon being analagous  to combustion, the plant will set free the negative electricity, and the  carbonic acid, the opposite electricity, which will immediately enter  into combination with the Ibrmer, if ever so little gas remains in contact  with the excess of carbon. This is so far true that in the combustion of  * Annales de Chimio et de Physinue, torn. XXXV, p. 405. 1827.   318 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.  carbon, as observed by M. Pouillet,* we obtain signs of electricity only  while the carbon, held perpendicularly, burns at its upper surface ; if  it be held nearly horizontally so that the carbonic acid which is formed  cannot rise except by ascending along the base of the carbon, the con-  denser no longer becomes cliarged, the two electricities having had  time to recombine. Now it is known that the combination of oxygen  with the carbon of the plant does not take place outside of the paren-  chyma, but in the interior; therefore before the carbonic acid formed and  remaining in contact with the carbon in excess is disengaged, the elec-  tricities that are developed ought to reunite and every sign of free elec-  tricity disappear. On the other hand it may be asked how it is that the  electrical effects obtained by M. Pouillet were the same night and day.  Ought they not to be different, since in the day there is the decompo-  sition of the acid absorbed, while during the night a portion of the  oxygen is transformed into acid ? Further, may not these same  electrical effects proceed from the remains of organic bodies which are  found in the vegetable earth of the capsules, and which, decomposing  by contact of air, generate carbonic acid, or rather may they not ho  attributed to the electro-cliemical action which the same earth would  naturally exercise on the conducting wires with which they may come in  contact?  Vegetation is, without doubt, the result of a multitude of chemical  reactions which necessarily disturb the equilibrium of the two elec-  tricities and thereby set free a portion of each ; but it is very difficult  to see in this the cause of the uniformly positive electricity, which  manifests its presence in the atmosphere whenever the sky is clear. If,  with M. Pouillet, we attribute the production of atmospheric elec-  tricity to evaporation and vegetation, the usual electrical state of  the atmosphere must vary in different regions, as this philosopherf  himself observes ; in one place we ought to find positive electricity  predominant, and in another negative. But experience is opposed to  this conclusion. We do not find any notice of observations of nega-  tive electricity in clear weather, except in the report of M. Arago,J  on a memoir containing the researches and observations made by  Marshal Mormont, duke of Ragusa, during his voyage to the East.  \" I perceived in this memoir,\" says M. Arago, ''three observations of  negative atmospheric electricity, made at Constantinople in clear  weather; three observations of the same kind at Alexandria, and three  entirely similar ones made near Cairo. We do not think,\" adds he,  'Hhat in France, England, or Germany, any observer has ever found  negative atmospheric electricity in clear weather.\" But if we recollect  that these experiments were made by means of a conductor, which  was moved slowly downward from above and upward from helow until  an electric effect was produced in the electroscope with which it was  in communication, we see from what has been said (1 part chap. II)  of the electric phenomena which the electrometers present when they  * Annales de Chimio et de Physique, torn. XXXV, page 405.  t Elements de Physique Expe'iiaieutale et de Mdte'orolog'c, torn.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 319  are raised or lowered, liow we may explain these indications of negative  electricity in clear weather.  It appears to ibllow, from what precedes, that the plienomena which  accompany evaporation and vegetation are not sufficient, in tlie present  state of science, to explain atmospheric electricity. M. A. de la Rive*  made in respect to this the following observations : \" Vegetation and  chemical action which take place on the surface of the globe produce  so little electricity, and especially afford signs of electricity the nature  of which is so variable, that we can hardl}^ attribute to them the con-  stantly positive electricitj'- with which the atmosphere is charged.  Moreover, these are phenomena which almost wlioUy cease during  winter, and yet observation teaches us that the atmosphere is very  frequently charged and sometimes with more electricity at this period  of the year than in any other. What is then the cause which pro-  duces this agent? May it not be sought for in a more general phe-  nomenon than any to which it has been hitherto attributed, to wit :  the unequal distribution of the temperature of the atmosphere?\"  The idea of regarding atmospheric electricity as a thermo-electric  phenomenon had already been propounded by the philosophers who  were first engaged in researches of this kind. After having ascer-  tained the laws of electric polarity which the tourmalin acquires  when its temperature is raised or lowered, Cantonf advanced the  opinion that heat might probably exercise an influence in the elec-  tric phenomena of the atmosphere. ''If we supposed/' says he,  \" that the air possesses qualities similar to tliose of the tourmalin,  that is to say, the capacity of becoming electric by the increase or  decrease of its heat, we can easily explain thunder-clouds, positive or  negative, as well as the peals of thunder.*' A similar sup[)osition  was also made by Th. Pionayne,| in the course of his observations on  atmospheric electricity.  The 0})inion which consists in regarding heat as the cause of atmos-  pheric electricity has received some degree of probability from the  labors of M. Becquerel. It is known that this philosopher succeeded in  demonstrating that when caloric is propagated in a metallic body  it produces in its whole extent such a series of decompositions and re-  combinations of the natural electricity that the positive electricity,  successively imparted by one molecule to the next, goes from the warm  to the cold part, and that the negative electricity follows the contrary  course. Hence a particle which becomes warm in receiving its heat  from a neighboring one, takes from the latter positive electricity and  gives it negative electricity. Ought not the same effect to be pro-  duced, though in a less degree, in bodies which are bad conductors of  electricity ? This ap})ears the more probable, when we recollect that  the conducting power of these bodies for electricity increases with the  temperature. Â§ M.

In this way he obtained  very sensible deviations of the needle of a rheometer by fixing to the  extremities of the wire of the latter two sticks of moistened clay, one  of which, strongly heated, was placed in contact with the other, re-  maining at the ordinary temperature. \" If we consider for an instant,\"  says M. Becquerel,* \" a portion of the atmosj^here in a perfect calm,  and having througliout the same temperature, the state of equilibrium  of its electricity would not be disturbed ; but if, by any cause what-  ever, it should happen to be penetrated by a current of cold air, a  part will become cool, take the negative electricity, and the other  part the positive electricity. The contact of the molecules being  short in duration, by reason of the rapidity of the current, every one  of them would preserve a part of the electricity which is disengaged  during the change of the temperature. If the portions which have  become cooled enclose aqueous vapor, this will become condensed, im-  bibe electricity, and form a cloud charged with negative electricity.  When the cold current of air contains vapor, a cloud will be found pos-  sessing positive electricity. It has been observed that in general the air  which is at a certain distance from houses and trees, possesses positive  electricity. This is evident, i'or the cold air which is found in contact  with the earth, after being heated at its expense, is raised on account  of a less specific gravity, and bears with it the positive electricity  which it has taken during its heating.\" It is probable that effects of  this kind take place in the atmosphere. Experience and observation  only can decide in what degree they concur in the production of the  electrical phenomena of the air.  We see from the foregoing how little we have advanced in our knowl-  edge of the origin of the positive electricity of the air in clear weather.  In examining this question, M. Peltierf offers a new opinion, accord-  ing to which the air is completely deprived of electricity, while  all the electric phenomena of the atmosphere derive their source from  the negative electricity of the earth. In describing the experiments  previously mentioned, in which an electrometer diverged positively  when it was raised, and negatively when lowered, he presents his  mode of considering atmospheric electricity, 'â–  These experiments,\"  says he, \"demonstrate that the earth acts as a body powerfully nega-  tive, and the celestial space as a body strongly positive, and all the  bodies interposed between them become electrified by induction, accord-  ing to their position and relations with the earth, and not by contact  with the air. When a jjerson is in an uncovered place, and under a  clear sky, his head is in a negative state, as are the upper ends of  all bodies, such as the tops of trees. This negative tension changes  with our position, with the state of the sky, and the shelter which  cover us. This electric induction is proved by placing the hand  raised above an insulated globe screwed to the upper part of the elec-  trometer. The leaves of gold diverge somewhat negatively. This  effect is reproduced with force when there prevails one of those red-   * Annales dc Chimie el de Physyique, torn. 5LI, page 372.  Compte's Kendus, torn. XII, page 3(i7 1841.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 321  dish dry fogs whicli are strongly negative ; they act at a less distance  and produce a greater inductive effect. These fogs show also what a  series of discharges would he produced between the gold leaves and  the armatures, if it were the air which was the electrified body.\"  These experiments place beyond doubt the existence of the nega-  tive electricity of the earth, of which M. Peltier speaks. It had  previously attracted the attention of De Saussure,* who, by a particular  arrangement of his electrometer, sought to ascertain its variations.  The most direct means of determining it consists in placing one of the  ends of a platina wire of a rheometer in a moist part of the ground,  and the other in a dry portion of the same ground or under an ad-  joining building. This part of the ground or of the building being,  on account of its partial conductibility, less charged with' electricity  than the moist ground, the electrical equilibrium is established be-  tween the two by the means of the metallic wire, and results in  an action on the magnetic needle. In this way M. Peltier f ascer-  tained that duiing clear weather the ground is constantly negative at  very different tensions, according to the hygrometric state and tem-  perature of the air. But if it be true that the earth possesses a nega-  tive electricity, and that an electrometer placed under a clear sky  becomes electrified by induction, and not by contact of the surround-  ing air, must we conclude, with M. Peltier, that the air is wholly  deprived of electricity? This philosopher introduced the positive in-  duction of celestial space in the electrical phenomena of the atmos-  phere ; but he used this language only that he might be the more  easily understood. According to him, ponderable bodies only have  the power of controlling the cause of electric phenomena. Empty  space, therefore, can control nothing. The earth, as a ponderable  body, possesses the power of coercion which M. Peltier calls negative  electricity, while celestial space, not being able to control this cause,  owes to this negative quality an electric reaction, which he calls vitre-  ous electricity. Further, this philosopher admits neither the theory  of the two electric fluids nor that of one fluid; but he regards the cause  of electric phenomena, the same as that of light and heat, as a  modification of a universal fluid which fills all spac3, and the terms of  \"vitreous\" and \"resinous\" have for him no other meaning than that  of indicating the different degrees of one and the same state, beginning  at a point of equilibrium deprived of all electric manifestation. It is  by these considerations that he explains the phenomena which the  electroscopes present when they are raised or lowered. This interpre-  tation of atmospheric electricity is then joined to a new theory of  electricity, which M, Peltier has hitherto only indicated, and of which  he promises afterwards to furnish all the details. However this may be,  it appears that the different methods of managing electroscopes under  a clear sky could likewise be explained by the theory of two electric  fluids and by the hypothesis of different atmospheric strata progressively  electrified. We might, however, ask how it happens that an electro-  scope which has been brought to an equilibrium presents no diver-  * Voyages dans lea Alpea, torn.

We believe that the explanation of this fact may be  derived from what we have said (part 1, ch. II) in quoting the opinion  of M. Gay Lnssac on the distribution of the electricity of the atmos-  phere; besides, we ought to remember that the lower strata of the air  can possess, in a free state, but a feeble quantity of electricity. Many  causes may, in fact, be opposed to the accumulation of free electricity  in these strata. In the first place, there is the proximity of the ground,  which, charged by induction with an electricity contrary to that of the  air, reacts consequently, by its attraction, to neutralize it. Another  cause is found in the great conductibility which the air of the same  strata naturally possess in consequence of the elevated temperature to  which they are subjected, and the approach of the molecules of water to  the state of vapor, circumstances which permit an easy escape for all the  free electricity. In fine, even though it should be supposed that the  air of these strata could contain a greater quantity of free electricity,  it appears, according to the experiment of Mr. Faraday and that of  M, Peltier himself, that the electric action being the same in every  direction, no divergence could take place in the instrument.   CHAPTER II.  or THE VAEIATIOXS OF ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY IN CLEAR WEATHER.  Â§1.0/\" the injluence of local causes and of the heigJU on atmospheric  electricity in clear loeather.  By means of his electrometer, furnished with a metallic stem, De  Saussure * observed that local causes exercised a very decided influ-  ence on the electrical indications obtained under a clear sky. He  discovered that they did not become sensible in the open plain, except  at a height of from 4 to 5 feet above the ground; that they are stronger  in the most elevated and isolated places; there are none in houses,  under trees, in streets, in courts, and, in general, in localities wholly  inclosed; that, nevertheless, in cities they are sensible in the midst  of large, open places, on quays, and especially on bridges where they  have been found more powerful than in the open country.  These results are confirmed by the observations which Schiiblerf  made during a journey in which he twice crossed the chain of the Alps  separating Germany from Italy. He always observed an increase in  the intensity of atmospheric electricity in proportion as the places  which he passed through were more elevated and isolated, and this  increase was so much the more remarkable the farther he was  removed from forests and habitations. Thus, on the 13th of April,  1813, at 4 o'clock in the evening, the electric tension at Mount St,  t^- Voyages dans les Alpes, torn. II, Â§ 792, page 205, and Â§ 800, page 219.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.   323   Gothard, 6,200 feet above the level of the ocean, was only -{- 10 de-  grees of Volta's electrometer, but the instrumeat rapidly passed to 50  and even to 60 degrees when it was placed on a granite rock 30 feet  high, which was found near tlie place where the observation was made.  The same instrument ordinarily indicated only 4 or 5 degrees at the  same time of the year, and at the same hour of the day, in the low  part of the same country.  Though Schiibler could not discover any direct relation between the  intensity of atmospheric electricity and the height of the place above  the level of the sea, yet he thought that this relation existed, but that  it was influenced by a multitude of causes. He believed he could not  be mistaken in general as to an increase of electricity with the height,  as is manifest in the following table, which contains the result of  his experiments made under a clear sky on the inclinations of an Alpine  mountain :   Height above   Height above   Degrees of   Observations.   the valley.   the surfnce of   electricity.     the ocean.

De Saussuref found, on the contrary, atmospheric electricity weaker  on mountains than in the plains. Thus, according to him, it is rather  the relative height of the place of observation than its absolute height,  which exercises an influence on the indications of the instruments.  The mode of action of atmos})heric electricity on the electrometer,  and the negative electricity which terrestrial bodies possess, explain  the influence which local causes exert on that instrument. Though  in general the electrometer gave no indication in places which were  sheltered, we ought, however, to remark, that it might give indica-  tions under trees or near buihlings which are in the neighborhood  of uncovered places, but then these indications are negative. This  happened when, after having brought the instrument to an equi-   - We shall hereafter see the cause of this negative electricity.  t Voyages dans les Alpes, torn.

If the sky  is clear, there is observed a negative divergence, which reached  its maximum when the instrument had come under a tree, or as near  as possible to a building ; while it returned to zero every time it is  carried back to the place from which it started. This observation,  which appears to have been reported for the first time by M. Erman,*  may be explained by observing that when the electrometer was brought  into an equilibrium under a positive influence its stem remained in pos-  session of the negative electricity, which, repelled by that of the same  name possessed by the tree or building, produces the divergence which  is observed.  The intensity of the electricity increases in proportion as we recede  from the surface of the earth. This increase was proved by the phi-  losophers who first engaged in this kind of research. De Romas, f  CavallOjJ and others obtained signs of electricity, the more powerful as  the kite which they used rose to a greater height. Science possesses  hitherto few data in respect to this fact. Schiibler sought to verify it  by observing the degrees of an electrometer, placed at increasing heights  on the side of a tower, so as to leave as nearly as possible the same  distance of five feet between its stem and the wall. The following  table shows the result of his experiments, which were made under a  clear sky, and at a temperature of 20Â° centigrade :   Perpendicular height  above the srrouud.

PeltierÂ§ discovered an important fact relative to the increase  respecting which he was inquiring. He observed that the electrometer  indicated an increasing positive electricity for 10 feet, while the first  indications of the rheometer did not take place except at a height of  131 feet. From 131 to 328 feet the needle moved feebly; but  beyond this height, even up to that of 810 feet, which was the  Â« Journal de Physique, torn.

Thus, then, under a  clear sky the intensity of atmospheric electricity increased slowly  up to a certain height, beyond which it increased with very great  rapidity. Another fact, not less important, is the existence of a stratum  of negative air interposed between the positive strata, a fact which  M. Peltier observed when in the course of warm days light clouds  were formed. The reverse of the sign in atmospheric electricity  was exhibited for the first time April 21, 1840. The sky was quite  clear, except that here and there the vapor formed into long cirrus  clouds, which moved slowly from the south, while the lower wind  was from the northwest. The kite reached the height of 100 feet,  and the rheometer had as yet given no signs of a current, though  the electrometer had indicated an increasing positive tension at the  height of 10 feet. At from 100 to 1 64 feet the rheometer deviated from  2Â° to 3Â°, and indicated a descending positive current. Above this  height the two instruments remained an instant without giving any  electric sign, after which the rheometer indicated a descending current  of 2Â° or 3Â°, but negative. The electrometer assigned to this negative  zone a thickness of about 66 feet, above which the positive electricity  reappeared. The new positive current, of which notice was given by  the rheometer, was at first feeble ; but the kite being raised to 394 feet,  the needle began to move rapidly. When it had reached 590 feet, the  current showed 60Â°, corresponding to 160 proportional degrees.  Some experiments on atmospheric electricity at different heights in  the air have also been made by Messrs. Becquerel* and Breschet, on  one of the plateaus in the vicinity of the Great St. Bernard, by  means of an arrow provided with a conducting wire, the extremity  of which communicated with a straw electrometer. The results at  which these philosophers arrived prove, 1. That on high mountains, in  clear weather, the electricity increases in intensity from leaving the  ground up to the height of at least 262 feet, the limit to which the  observations were carried ; 2. That this electricity always remains  positive, without any appearance of change of sign.  We ought also to mention the experiments which Messrs. Gay  Lussac and Biotf made during their t\\3rostatic ascension. These  philosophers likewise found atmospheric electricity increasing with  the height ; but it appeared to them negative, though the sky was  perfectly clear. This result is not surprising, if we consider that  the mode of experimenting adopted in this case consisted in suspend-  ing, by one end, a metallic wire of 164 feet long, terminated at the  lower end by a ball of metal, and that it was the electricity at the  top of the wire which was observed. This electricity would, then, be  of the same nature as that produced by a charged plate held over the  point or the ball of an electrometer; the point or ball would be  charged negatively by the positive induction of the plate.

'has shown in this way that the lesult may be very well inter-  preted by the hypothesis of atmospheric strata more intensely electri-  fied with height, since then the upper strata, more strongly charged  â– with positive electricity, exercise on the metallic wire an action of  induction more powerful than that produced by the electricity of the  lower strata.  Â§11. â€” Of the diurnal and annual variations of atmospheric electricity  in clear loeaiher.  Le Monnierf first observed that in the same place positive elec-  tricity in clear days was subject to regular variations of intensity.  He noticed that it diminished by degrees towards sunset, and finally  at last disappeared one or two hours afterwards, and did not re-  appear till towards eight or nine o'clock in the morning. He at first  attributed this daily variation to the moisture of the night, which,  rendered the insulation of his apparatus less perfect ; but after taking  suitable precautions he ascertained that there was another cause for  this phenomenon. Beccaria,| Gardine,Â§ Crosse, || and other observers  arrived at the same result. De SaussureT[ determined the laws of this  daily period by means of observations made with his electrometer,  armed with a conductor terminating in a point. He observed that it  presented two maxima, which followed some hours after the rising  and setting of the sun, and two minima, which preceded the rising and  setting of the same luminary. \"In winter,\" he says, \"the season  during which I have most successfully observed the electricity of clear  air, it appears to me that the hours when it is most feeble are those  which are comprised between the time when the evening dew has  wholly completed its fall and that when the sun has risen, Next,  its intensity increases gradually and reaches, almost always, before  noon a definite maximum, after passing which it seems to decrease  until it is renewed at the fall of the dew, a period at which it is  sometimes stronger than during the day. After this it diminishes  gradually during the night, without, however, becoming null when  the weather is clear.\" The observations which Schiibler** continued  for a whole year, at Stuttgard, lead to the same result. They showed  that when the weather is clear atmospheric electricity, which is very  feeble before the rising of the sun, afterwards increases at first slowly,  then rapidly, until it reaches its first maximum some hours after ;  that it also diminishes, at first rapidly, then slowly, until it has reached  its minimum, some hours before the setting of the sun ; that it begins  again to increase when the sun approaches the horizon, and attains  its second maximum some hours after its setting ; to diminish again  during the rest of the night.  * Traitd de Physique Exp^rimentalc et Mathdmatique, torn.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.   327   The electrical periods determined by the observations of Mr. Clarke,*  of Dublin, are somewhat different. According; to him, the first minimum  takes place at three o'clock in the morning ; the electricity then  increases till ten o'clock ; it then slightly diminishes till eleven o'clock,  then increases anew till two o'clock and forty-five minutes in the  evening ; at three o'clock it begins again to decrease, but more rapidly  than the first time, till five o'clock ; it then increases till seven  o'clock ; then rapidly decreases till it has reached its minimum at  three o'clock next day.  In order to exhibit more clearly these periods of atmospheric elec-  tricity, we quote the observations which were made by Schtiblerf  on the 11th day of May, 1811, at very short intervals of time, and  under a sky constantly clear. We shall follow them by a series of  analogous observations, for which we are indebted to De Saussure,^  and add some of those which were made by M. AragoÂ§ at the observa-  tory of Paris by means of the straw electrometer.  Ohserixdions hy Sclrnhhr.   Hours.   Degrees of the  electrometer.   Hygrometer of  Saussure.

The hourly observations of Schiibler indicate a first minimum at four  o'clock in the morning, a first maximum at eight o'clock, a second  minimum at five o'clock in the evening, and a second maximum at  eight and a half o'clock in the evening.  If we look at the first eighteen observations of De Saussure, which  include from twenty-four to twenty-five hours, during which the  sky remained almost clear, we see that at first the electricity was  quite strong towards nine o'clock in the morning ; that it decreased  gradually till six o'clock, when the first minimum was exhibited ;  it then increased till eight o'clock, when it reached the second  maximum; and then it decreased anew till the time of the second  minimum, which took place about six o'clock the next day. We do   Â« Deviation variable.   fMore thaa26o.   330 ATMOSPHEKIC ELECTKICITY.  not subsequently observe as mucli regularity in tlie electrical periods  on account of the cloudy weather.  The observations of M. Arago indicate a first maximum toward nine  o'clock in the morning ; but as all the observations of the succeeding  hours have not been collected, we cannot determine the hour of the  second maximum, nor the hours of the two minima; still we can always  establish their existence.  Schiibler* found that the electrical maxima and minima do not  always take place at the same hour of the day. They vary, particularly  with the periods of the rising and setting of the sun ; in the longest  days of summer the first maximum appears sooner, and in the shortest  days it happens later, and approaches the hour of noon ; the second  maximum, on the contrary, is retarded in the first instance, and hap-  pens sooner in the second. It follows that the greatest distance  between the first maximum and the second fall in the middle of the  summer, and the least in the middle of winter, when the two maxima,  especially in a cold and cloudy day, appear blended together. This  result does not at all accord with that which De Saussuref deduced  from his observations. \" Generally in summer,\" he says, \"when the  earth is dry, on account of the drought of the preceding weather, and  when a day occurs which is clear, dry, and warm, the electricity of the  air goes on increasing from the rising of the sun, when it is nearly  imperceptible until towards three or four o'clock in the afternoon,  when it acquires its greatest force. It then gradually decreases till  the moment of the fall of the dew, when it increases again, then  diminishes, and finally ceases entirely in the night.\"  We ought, however, to remark that SchiiblerJ: sometimes observed  that the maximum happened later than ordinary in the morning, and  sooner in the evening, when the temperature of the air was colder  than usual at the same season. He observed this phenomenon also  during a severely cold winter, and in some cool days of summer.  However this may be, we give the mean periods of the two maxima  and of the first minimum for the different months of the year, such as  follow from the observations of this philosopher. As for the second  minimum, which happens in the afternoon, Schiibler found in all his  observations the same period of two o'clock, because atmospheric elec-  tricity at that hour is very near its minimum in all seasons, and in  winter it coincides with it.

(1) In his observations on atmospheric electricity made during clear days of the month  of March, 1830, M. Arago found that the mean hour in respect to the first maximum was  about 8/2. 48m. for the same month.   These observations show that the different periods of the year exert  a striking influence on the intensity of atmospheric electricity in clear  weather as indicated by the electrometer. This fact was previously  established by Cavallo,* who found the intensity with which it acted  greater in cold weather than in warm. Voltaf observed that in winter  his electrometer indicated from ten to twenty degrees as the maximum  of the morning, that it often indicated eight degrees towards the hour  of sunrise, while in summer the maximum of the morning rose to only  six degrees, and that of the evening to eight. De SaussureJ observed,  likewise, that atmospheric electricity is much weaker in summer than  in winter ; at the latter ])eriod of the year, in the open country, he  observed the small balls of his electrometer diverge two lines, whereas  in summer their greatest separation was but one line. This circum-  stance was especially to be noted in Schubler'sÂ§ observations, as  may be seen by the following table, which includes the mean intensi-  ties of the electricity of clear air at mean periods of the maodmoj and  minima, as well as the general mean and absolute 'maximum of each,  month.  â€¢\"' Trait6 complet d'Electricite, pa.ge 293.  f Dictionnaire de Gehler, tome VI, page â€¢17.5.  j Voyages dans les Alpes, tome II.

Of the prohahle causes of the periodical variations of atmospheric  electricity in clear weather. â€” Many physicists have endeavored to ascer-  tain the cause of the daily variations of atmospheric electricity when the  weather is clear. De Saussure,* observing that they were in propor-  * Voyages dans les Alpes, torn. II, sec. 831, p. 256.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 333  tion to the hygrometric state of the air, gave the following explana-  tion : \"Towards the end of the night the electricity appears very  feeble, either because the evaporation is nearly nothing, or because the  moisture of the preceding evening and that of the night which fol-  lowed it have transmitted to the earth nearly the whole electric fluid  accumulated in the air. But when the sun begins to warm the earth  again the electricity of the atmosphere increases, because the vapor  which the heat causes to rise from tiie earth conveys electricity into the  air, and transmit, in part, that which begins to accumulate. But  when the sun reaches a certain height the heat increases in a greater  degree than the evaporation ; the air is dry, and transmits with  difficulty the electric fluid accumulated in the height of the atmo-  sphere. It follows that our electrometers, placed near the surface of  the earth, indicate a decrease of electricity, although the electric fluid  continues to accumulate in the elevated regions. Again, as the sun  approaches the end of his career the air is cooled, becomes damp, and  begins to transmit more abundantly to the earth the electric fluid  accumulated in the higher regions. The electrical intensity must  then increase with the moisture until two or three hours after sunset.  Finally, when the air begins to be exhausted of its moisture the elec-  tricity decreases anew until the next day.\" De Saussure, according  to the same i)rinciple, explains why atmospheric electricity is much  less powerful in summer than in winter. The air in the first case  being warm and dry resists with more force the escape of the electric  fluid accumulated in the upper regions of the atmosphere ; while in  the winter the moist air must produce a contrary effect. He thought  that the accumulation of free electricity, in summer, in the elevated  regions of the atmosphere is probably one of the causes of the fre-  quency of thunder storms in this season.  This manner of accounting for the daily variations of atmospheric  electricity, which M. Becquerel* and other philosophers have also  adopted, rests on the development of electricity during the evaporation  of water â€” a phenomenon which does not appear sufficiently proved in  the present state of science, as we have heretofore shown. It sup-  poses, also, that an electrometer is charged by the contact of the sur-  rounding air ; and we have seen, according to M. Peltier, that the  contrary is true. Besidts, it is difficult to conceive how vapor can  transmit tlie electricity Vv'ith which it is charged to the higher strata  of the atmosphere at the same time that it transfers towards the  earth that which is accumulated in these same strata. Finally,  among the lower moist and conducting strata there must be found  other strata sufficiently dry, and consequently so imperfect in their  conducting power as not to permit the transmissions of electricity.  Schiibler's observations establish a direct relation between the  daily variations of the electricity of the air and those which occur in  its state of relative moisture. In fact, if we examine the table which  contains the hourly observations made by thisphilosopher on the 11th  of May, 1811, we see that atmospheric electricity is at its miimnum a  Â« Traite de 1' Electricity et du Magn^tisme, torn. IV, p. 102.   334 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.  little before sunrise, and that it increases but slowly during the rising  of this luminary_, the increase being very small in the first hour; at the  same time the hygrometer advances but little at first, and in a man-  ner barely perceptible, towards dryness. Soon after the electricity  increases rapidly, and it attains (some hours later) toward eight  o'clock its first maximum. At this time of day the temperature of the  air rises quite rapidly ; the hygrometer likewise advances some de-  grees towards dryness ; but if we reduce by calculation its indications  to the same temperature, it is found that the absolute moisture of the  air, instead of decreasing, rather increases in the first hours which  follow sunrise. When the electricity has reached its first maximum  and begins to decrease, the lower strata of the air lose their moist  condition ; the atmosphere becomes clear, and the sky assumes insen-  sibly a pure blue. It is also at this period that the dryness of the  air becomes real, which is clearly announced by the hygrometer.  About two o'clock in the afternoon the electricity is very feeble, and  near its second minimum; it contributes to decrease a little in summer,  until towards four or five o'clock. Now, we may observe that this  is precisely the period of the greatest real dryness in the air. An hour  before sunset the electricity begins anew to increase, though slowly ;  it shows itself more and more in proportion as the sun descends ; and  a little time after it disappears below the horizon it increases more  rapidly, and soon after reaches its second maximum; also, during  this time light vapors appear in the atmosphere. At sunset the air  had lost its transparency, the moisture rapidly increased, the fresh-  ness of the evening came on, and the dew is formed. From this mo-  ment the electricity decreases with the actual moisture of the air.  The relation between the progress of atmospheric electricity  observed by Schiibler and that of the hygrometric state of the air iji  the course of the day is then evident. It is the same for the'periods of  the mean maxima and minima of the year ; for, if we examine the  table which contains the intensities of the electricity for the different  months, we observe that the intensity is the strongest in the month of  January and most feeble in the months of April and May. Now_,  it is precisely the same periods which exhibit the extremes of the rela-  tive humidity of the air.* It is, therefore, no longer doubtful, as De  Saussure was the first to observe, that the daily variations of atmospheric  electricity are only the result of the changes which take place  in the hygrometric state of the air. Schiiblerf advanced the same  opinion; but, admitting Volta's theory, he found the explanation in  the electricity which the vapor conveys to the air in a latent state,  and which it set free at the moment of its passage to the state of  vesicles.  We know that it is not in the greater or less quantity of positive  electricity conveyed by the vapor of the atmosphere that we must  seek for the cause of the daily variations of the electricity, since the  circumstances which attend the formation of vapor give the air suf-  ficient conducting power to produce the decomposition of the electric  fluids liberated at the instant. â€” (See page 316.) We know, further, that  ~ Lelirbi'.ch der Meteorologio, von L. F. Kaemtz, torn. T, p. 337.  t JourLal de Schweigger, torn. VIII, p. 29.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 335  tlie divergence \"of tlie gold leaves or straws of an electrometer is owing  to a superior positive induction, and not to the electricity which the  surrounding air has communicated to this instrument. Finally, if  we recollect that the presence of an ignited body is sufiicient to render  this divergence greater, we may perhaps conclude that the daily vari-  ations of atmospheric electricity, such as have been observed by  De Saussure and Schiibler are only in a great degree the effect of  changes which, during the course of the day, take place in the electric  radiation of the electrometer. In fact, these changes depend directly  on the greater or less facility with which the negative electricity  can escape, and consequently on the conductibility of the air.  Everything which tends to increase this conductibility will favor the  electric radiation, and consequently the divergence of the gold leaves  produced by the repelling electricity ; on the contrary, everything that  diminishes the conductibility also weakens the radiating power and the  divergence of the instrument. But as the conductibility of the air is  in its turn dependent on the quantity of vapors it contains, it appears  to us that an electrometer with a metallic rod ending in a point,  would give in the same circumstances, that is to say, under a clear sky,  indications in direct accordance with the hygrometric state of the air.  Accordingly, the electric radiation, and consequently the diver-  gence of the gold leaves, will increase at sunrise, on account of the  vapor which rises in the air, and render this medium a better con-  ductor of electricity; it will be the same in the evening towards sun-  set, v/hen the decrease in the temperature will produce the condensation  of the vapor which is in the lower strata of the air. Toward the  middle of the day, on the contrary, the warmer air is at the same  time dryer and consequently a poorer conductor of electricity;  hence the radiation of the electrometer as well as the divergence of its  leaves will diminish. Finally, this divergence ought likewise to  decrease some hours after sunset, when, by the fall of the dew_, the air  becomes relatively less a conductor.  Thus the daily variations which the electrometer exhibits in its  indications appear to us to explain in part the changes which the  electric radiation of this instrument undergoes in the course of the  day. In the same manner we account for many observations made by  De Saussure and other scientists. It is known that De Saussure  found the intensity of positive electricity under a clear sky stronger  onquays, and particularly on bridges, than in the open country.  This ought evidently to be the case, not because the vapors which rise  constantly from the surface of the water convey to the air a greater  quantity of positive electricity, as has been supposed, but because the  air, being in these places more saturated with moisture than elsewhere,  ought to possess greater conductibility, and consequently render easier  the electric radiation of the electrometer. In the same manner may  be explained why the electric intensity is more feeble in summer than  in winter, since, in summer the air being less moist than in winter,  would also be less a conductor of electricity. We see, also, why in the  times of prolonged drought the intensity of the electric periods decrease  gradually, as has been observed by Schiibler.*  * Journal de SchÂ»veigger, torn. VIII, p. 28.   336 ATMOSPHEKIC ELECTRICITY.  But it is not necessary to conclude from what has been said that i*-  is in radiation only that the cause of the daily variations of atmos\"  pheric electricity is found. We shall see, in speaking of the formation  of electric clouds, that the sum of the facts tends to prove that the  vapors reach the air charged with negative electricity, and that it  weakens by its presence the higher positive influence to which the in-  struments are subjected, so that the indication of the electrometer must  still decrease in the course of the day proportionally to the quantity  of the vapor which rises in the air. But to appreciate the effect pro-  duced by this latter cause it is necessary to render the observations  independent of the electric radiation of the instrument.  It has been remarked that a certain relation might be observed  between the variations of atmospheric electricity and the other phe-  nomena which take place periodically on the surface of the earth.  For example, according to Mr. Kaemtz,* these variations are not per-  haps without relation to the phenomena which accompany vegetation.  It is known that, under the influence of solar light, plants give out  oxygen, and that during the night they exhale carbonic acid. The  former of these two opposite phenomena would be the most active  when the sun is nearest the zenith, and the latter when this body  approaches the horizon. Mr. Kaemtz thought that these two differ-  ent modes, in which the plants acted on the air, could not be without  some other influence on the daily variations of the electricity. But  if we admit this opinion we must prove that the electric phenomena  observed by M. Pouillet in his experiments on vegetation are, in fact,  produced by the cause which this philosopher assigned to them.  Schiibler thought he observed a correspondence between the oscilla-  tions of the magnetic needle and the electric periods. f The point of a  horizontal magnetic needle turned to the north in fact moves from  the east to the west, from eight and a half o'clock in the morning till  one hour and a quarter after noon, and from west to east from one and  a quarter hour in the afternoon till the next day morning. There  is then a maximum of departure to the east, which takes place at eight  and a half o'clock in the morning, and another to the west towards  one and a quarter o'clock. Finally the same philosopher^ made the  observation that the daily variations of atmospheric electricity corre-  spond very well with those of the barometer, the maxima also taking  place for the latter as well as for electricity later in winter than in  summer.  * Lehrbuch der Meteorologie, torn.

OP ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY IN OVERCAST, FOGGY, AND CLOUDY WEATHER.  Â§ I. â€” Of atmospheric electricity in clouthj iceatlier and during fogs.  De Saussure* appears to be the first who observed that in cloudy-  weather, but without rain or storm, atinos|)heriG electricity exhib-  ited almost the same character that it did in clear weather. The  observations made by Schublerf confirm this result. The latter estab-  lished the fact that Vv^hen the weather was cloudy, without being at  the same time stormy, the electricity was still positive; but he found  that its intensity was less than in clear weather^ as Cavalloj and other  philosophers had already remarked before him. Further, the indica-  tions of the electrometer are stronger in winter than in summer;  and although the daily variations may be less regular than in clear  weather, they nevertheless present a period in the means of the ob-  servations made during the hours which are relative to the maxima  and minima of every month. Tliis is shown by the following table  which gives the results of the observations that Schiibler made under  an overcast sky four times a day:   Mean niouthly forces of atmospheric electricity.

It was in thick fogs which did not terminate  in rain that Th. Ronayne,* in Ireland, and Achard,t at Berlin, ob-  served the strongest electricity. The latter of these scientists twice  noticed that the divergence of the balls of Canton's electrometer  ceased when the fog fell in the form of very fine rain^ and wholly  disappeared in less than a quarter of an hour. This phenomenon has  some connexion, perhaps, with the fact, frequently observed, that the  electricity of fogs sometimes changes from positive to negative when  they are resolved into rain.  Volta;j: and De SaussureÂ§ have both noticed the great tension of  electricity during fogs; according to the former it was especially fogs  attended by an odor which exhibited the most powerful action on the  instruments; in tliis case, also, he frequently saw his electrometer  exhibit a divergence which reached 100Â°, and sometimes gave out  sparks at the approach of a conducting body. Schiibler'sH observa-  tions also agree with those which we have mentioned, but the latter  remarked besides that, during fogs, the variations of atmospheric  electricity were wholly irregular, though its force varied with the sea-  sons, as it occurred in clear weather, the electrometer presenting the  greatest divergence in the winter months during the coldest days.

When the sky is cloudy without heing overcast the instruments  indicate numerous and irreguhxr variations, either in the nature or in  the intensity of the electricity. Nearly at the same period, Frank-  lin, ''^ in America, and Canton, f in England, first observed that  among clouds some were in a positive others in a negative state. This  fact was confirmed subsequently by all other observers. Frequently  the electric tension was increased in the apparatus when a cloud  approached the zenith, and the phenomenon was the more decided  w4ien the cloud, after being rapidly formed, was dissipated slowly.  Science possesses few data relative to the electricity of the clouds.  According to observations of De SaussureJ during his sojourn on the  Col. de Geant, the electricity of the clouds on the peak of Mount Blanc  was found to be constantly positive. Schubler,Â§ who examined the  electricity of the clouds in the region of the air where they are  formed, there discovered a force equal to what he was accustomed to  find possessed by thick fogs in the low countries, and he obtained  no signs of negative electricity except where the rain was formed.  We will quote here some of his observations made in an ascent of  the Rigi, 5j27G feet above the level of the sea.   Dates.   â€¢^ .-  = a  S 2   Observations.

It follows, from observations made by M. Peltier,* that during the  course of the summer of the year 1835 the greater part of the clouds  were electric, and that nearly all of them possessed positive electricity.  He found scarcely ten to twelve negative clouds among those which  jiassed over his apparatus ; but the case was entirely different in the  summer months of the next year, during which M. Peltier continued  his observations. The clouds were for the most part neutral, and even  among those which he judged were electric, from their ashy color and  their jagged and movable edges, most of them left the instruments  in complete repose. Those which were electric were nearly all nega-  tively so.  The only inference which can be drawn from the preceding is, that  positive clouds are greater in number than negative ones.  Â§ III. â€” Of the formation of electric clouds.  The formation of electric clouds is a question the solution of which  has occupied many philosophers. Some of them, and at their  head the illustrious Volta,t have sought to explain it by admitting,  as we have already seen, that the positive electricity rises in the latent  state with the vapor furnished by the ground, and becomes free  again when it is condensed. Such might be the origin of clouds  positively electrified as well as of atmospheric electricity. As to the  formation of the negative clouds, Volta thought that a cloud strongly  positive must exercise an electrical influence on a very feebly electrified  cloud lying within its sphere of activity, and consequently produces  a decomposition of its natural electricities ; so that if the repelled  electricity meets other clouds,, vapors or eminences on the surface of the  earth, it will escape and leave the cloud charged with negative elec-  tricity. By means of this theory we may explain in a satisfactory  manner the strong positive electricity which is observed during fogs  and dew, and especially that which is exhibited in the rapid formation  of thunder clouds ; but we ha^/e seen that the facts which science pos-  sesses in its present state do not favor this theory.  De Saussurel has advanced the opinion that the clouds perform no  other office than that of a conductor, and that the electricity which is  perceived at the moment of their passage above an electro-atmospheric  apparatus is only that which they derive from the higher strata of the  air. He was led to this result by an experiment made on the top of  Fours, in which he observed that, in throwing into the air during  the absence of clouds the small leaden ball of his electrometer, he  obtained an electricity equal and even superior to that which those  clouds gave in passing above his head.  M. Gay LussacÂ§ supposes that the electricity is disseminated in  the atmosphere, in a tree state, ready to be transferred to the con-  ductors which are presented to it, and that it exists in the same quan-   Â«- Comptes Eendus, torn.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 341  tity in the cloud just formed as in the mass of the air hefore the  formation of the cloud. \"If,\" saj'S he, \"a cloud is formed while the  air is pure and transparent, and the electricity is thus disseminated  in all its mass, every vesicle being a good conductor, the electricty  will unite at its surface in a stratum extremely thin, and may  remain in this state, if it is weak and if the aqueous vesicles are not  near each other. We shall thus have a cloud which in this state  will not be stormy; its electricitj' will be the same as that of the mass  of air in whicli it is formed, but its tension will be increased by its less  diffusion and its concentration around the vesicles. The cloud must  then appear more strongly electrified than the transparent air, as ob-  servation demonstrates. If the cloud is very dense, and consequently  the vesicles whicli form it are much closer, it may be regarded as a con-  tinuous conductor; and according to the laws of electric distribution  the fluid will abandon the interior of the cloud for its surface^ on which  it will diffuse itself in equilibrium, and will be there retained by the  pressure of the surrounding air.\"  M. Gay Lussac thinks that the electricity usually diffused in the  air and collected in (his manner is sufficient to render clouds power-  fully electrical.  In this way of considering the formation of electric cluuds, M. Gay  Lussac makes no mention of the nature of the electricity which is  transferred to their surface when they are very dense ; it must be ne-  cessarily admitted that it is positive, since the atmosphere in clear  weather always possesses positive electricity. We might, indeed, thus  explain the formation of clouds charged with positive electricity ; but  how cou d we conceive the exihtence of clouds negatively electrified,  when the atmosphere in which they are formed contains only positive  electricity. M. Lame* thus explains this phenomenon, \" The clouds  occupying different heights, and experience indicating that atmospheric  electricity observed in clear weather is greater at greater distances from  the surface of the earh, it is conceived that the higher clouds, charged  with a greater quantity of positive electricity than those below, may  act by induction on the latter, repelling their positive fluid, which  being dissipated more quickly in the air than the fluid attracted,  leaves the negative electricity free on the lower clouds.\" But if it is  we admit that electric clouds exercise on each other an action by induc-  tion, still it is not seen how the positive fluid repelled should dissipate  itself sooner in the air than the fluid attracted ; ought not the contrary  rather to take place on account of the less distance which separates the  upper cloud from the portion of the lower cloud where the negative  electricity attracted may be accumulated?  M. Becquerelf proposed a new theory of the formation of electric  clouds, Avhich embraces at once positive, negative, and neutral clouds.  According to this philosopher, the vapor which is formed on the  surface of the globe in general carry with it, besides the positive  electricity which is peculiar to it, a portion greater or less of the  negative electricity which the earth habitually possesses. '* Hence,\"  '- Cours de Physique de Ecole Polytechnique, toin II, 2d part, page SO. Paris, 1S37.  j Traite de I'Electricitc et du Magnctisme, torn IV, p. 121.   342 ATMOSPHEKIC ELECTEICiTT.  he eays, \" according to the tension of this electricity, the vapor  which rises in the air is electrified positively, negatively, or is found  to be in a neutral state, and the clouds to the formation of which  it concurs partake of the same electrical state. We cannot deter-  mine,\" he adds, \" in what circumstances the vapor is negative,  since the tension of the electricity of the earth must vary on ac-  count of the nature of the portion of surface where the evaporation  takes place. If the liquid which forms the vapor rests on conducting  bodies, the negative electricity diffuses itself at a distance; while, if  they are bad conductors, it remains in its place, and in this case per-  haps it is borne off by the vapor and unites in the formation of nega-  tive clouds.\"  This theory of M. Becquerel is based on the hypothesis that the  water receives positive electricity by being transformed into vapor,  and that the same vapor, in certain circumstances, carry off a greater  or less portion of the negative electricity of the ground. The first part  of this theory is at variance with the experiments of M. Peltier. The  second M. Becquerel sought to sustain by observation of the nega-  tive electricity of cascades. We are indebted to Tralles* for the first  observation of this phenomenon. Finding himself one day in the  Alps, opposite the cascade of Standbach, (Staubbach?) near the Sauter-  brunnen, he presented his atmospheric electrometer, not armed with  the metallic wire, to the fine spray, which resulted from the dispersion  of the water. He immediately obtained very distinct signs ot nega-  tive electricity. The same effect was exhibited at the cascade of  Keichenbach. Volta, a short time after, verified the correctness of this  observation not only above the great cascades, but also wherever a fall  of water existed, however small provided the intervention of the  the wind, caused the dispersion of the drops. The electricity always  appeared to him as it did to Tralles, negative. Schiiblerf repeated  the same experiments in his journey to the Alps, in 1813. He  observed fjirther, that this negative electricity was very strong, since  it became perceptible at a distance of 300 feet from the cascade of  Eeichenbach, and at a distance of 100 feet his electrometer indicated  400, and even 500 degrees. On presenting to the spray a small  Leyden phial, armed wifh a point furnished with ignited tinder, it  became charged in a few moments, so as to furnish sparks and sensible  shocks â€” a })henomenon which Schiibler did not observe, except in  rains, strongly electrified, and during storms. During these experi-  ments the sky was clouds.  The negative electricity found in the dispersion of water has been  explained in different ways, Tralles attributed it at first to the fric-  tion of the minute dro})S of water against the air ; but soon after he  thought with Volta^ that the cause was to be found in the evaporation  which the same minute drops experience in falling. It may be said,  as to the first manner of interpreting this phenomenon, that if expe-  rience shows that the parts of a solid body, like charcoal, reduced to fine  * Oeuvres de Volta, torn. II, page 239.  f Journal de Schweigger, torn. IX, page 358.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTEICITY. 343  powder, acquire by their friction an electricity perceptible by the elec-  troscope, there is nothing to show that the same Avill not be the case  even from the friction of the liquid particles against each other, or of  the liquid particles against the ])articles of air. Besides, an electricity  as strong as that which is exhibited by the spray of the cascades would  be scarcely in proportion to so feeble a cause of development. As  for the second explanation, which is the one given by Volta, and which  Schiibler also adopted, besides that it rests on the hypothesis of the  development of the electricity, in the formation of vapor, a num-  ber of other objections may be made, to which it is difficult to give  a satisfactory answer. Thus it appears impossible to conceive how  the drops of water in simply falling from the height of some hundred  feet can become electrified by evaporation, so as to produce an elec-  tricity as strong as that which has been observed during storms, and  even stronger than that which is ordinarily exliibitcd in the drops  of rain which fall from a height incomparably greater.  As we have already said, M. Becquerel found in the negative elec-  tricity of falls of water a proof of his theory of the formation of nega-  tive clouds. According to him, this electricity proceeds from that  which the earth habitually possesses. The water, in falling with great  velocity on the rocks, is scattered into vesicular globules, which carry  with them into the atmosphere the negative electricity which they  have taken from the rocks. M. Becquerel drew from this the con-  clusion that the vapor which is formed at the surface of the globe  may, in the same way, carry away a portion of the negative elec-  tricity of the earth.  This explanation has been opposed by M. Belli,* who believes that  the electrical phenomenon of the water of cascades is owing to the  development of electricity by the induction which the positive electricity  of the atmosphere exercises on the water. \" The water,\" he says,  \"is by induction in the negative state, when the atmosphere is as it is  ordinarily, charged with positive electricity. At the moment when  this water divides into thousands of minute drops, it cannot fail to carry  the electricity with whicli the electrical induction of the atmosphere  has impre<::nated it to all the bodies which it meets.\" M. Belli made  some experimental researches in support of his opinion. He arranged  in an uncovered place, and under a clear sky, a portable fountain.  He then discharged a jet of water slightly inclined from the perpen-  dicular, and collected the drops which escaped in an insulated vessel,  communicating with a Leyden phial. On examining it with the con-  denser, he ascertained that the droj)s of water were very perceptibly  negatively electrified. When the compressed fountain was insulated  and put in communication with an electroscope, he obtained a very  marked divergence of positive electricity, which was reproduced every  time it was destroyed by momentarily touching with the hand the ball  of the electroscope. According to i\\l. Belli, tiiese experiments demon-  strate that the column of ascending water becomes electrified by the  electric induction of the atmosphere. To show that tiie evaporation  of the water was of some importance in this phenomenon, he repeated  â– 5 Bibl. Univ., Nmivcllc Serie, torn. VI, page 148. 1836.   344 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.  the same experiments in one of the courts of a larp;e building, without  any electrical sign appearing, which accords with the theory since  we know, from De 8aussure's experiments, that the electric induction  of the clear atmosphere is not felt in a sensible manner in places  inclosed on all sides.  This last explanation indicates the true cause of the negative elec-  tricity of the water of cascades, since the divergence of the gold leaves  of an electrometer exposed to the air proves that the induction of the  positive electricity of the atmosphere is felt at the surface of the  earth, while experiment demonstrates that it is in an habitual state  of negative electricity. We may remark that this explanation is  susceptible of |.iroof of another kind ; for if it be true, tlie electricity  of the water of the cascades will not always have the same sign ; it  will be negative if the atmosphere is positive; on the contrary, it will  be positive when the clouds are negative. In order, then, that there  may remain no doubt as to the cause ot\" this phenomenon, it would  be sufficient to examine the electricity of natural cascades in stormy  weather,  Althougii the explanation of M, Belli differs sensibly from that  which M. Becquerel has given, yet it goes to support the cause as-  signed by the latter philosopher for the formation of negative clouds.  If the water at the moment of the evaporation is negatively electrified  by the influence of atmospheric electricity, the vapor must neces-  sarily partake of that electric state and carry away with it a portion  of the negative electricity. This vapor, then, in passing to the  vesicular state will constitute clouds negatively electrified. But, as  we have already observed, if the theory of M. Becquerel explains the  formation of negative clouds, it gives an explanation of positive  clouds which the present state of the science cannot allow us any  longer to admit,  M. Peltier, in his new theory of the electrical phenomena of the  atmosphere,* considers the formation of electric clouds in a way which  appears more in harmony with observed facts. He remarks that the  atmosphere is the seat of two kinds of evaporation, one of which is  produced at the surface of water and of moist ground, and the other  at different heights in the air, when the opaque clouds pass to a state  of elastic vapor. The former, when the sky is serene, cannot generate  positive vapors, since experiment shows that when vapor is produced  at the ordinary temperature the electrometer exhibits no sensible trace  of the electricities disengaged at the instant of its formation; but as  this vapor is formed at the surface of the earth, which possesses a  great negative tension, and under the positive influence of the sky, it  must necessarily be charged with negative electricity. M. Peltier  sought to verify this by the experiment of placing the water in the  same conditions as it is found in nature, that is to say, under a  positive influence ; the vapor disengaged from water, distilled or not  distilled, contained in an insulated vessel and placed under a globe  positively electrified, was found to be negative, while the remainder  of the liquid remained positively electrified.  â€¢ Comptes Eendus, torn. XII, page 307, and Annales de Chiuiie etde Physique, 3d series,  torn. IV, page 414, &c.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTEICITT. 345  After having established this principle, ^l. Peltier thus explains  the electricity of clouds: When the first elastic va})()r charged with  negative electricity has been condensed into opaque clouds by being  cooled down, and the temperature in rising again afterwards pro-  duces a second evaporation, which takes place under a superior  positive induction, and the first vapor produced has its negative  tension increased, at the expense of the lower strata of cloud, kept  at the positive state by terrestrial influence. It follows that the  elastic vaj)or produced in the second evaporation is more strongly  negative than that first formed, while the vapor produced by the  evaporation of the lower strata of the cloud will become positive.  When a new lowering of temperature afterwards produces condensa-  tion into clouds of the secondary vapor, the higher masses form  negative and the lower masses positive clouds, the former keeping  tliemselves at a greater elevation than corresponds to their specific  gravity, because of the repulsion of the earth, the latter, on the con-  trary, descending to a lower level than belongs to their weighton account  of the attraction of the globe. This transformation of the elastic into  opaque vapor, and of opaque into elastic vapor, alternating a  great number of times, according to the atmospheric conditions,  â– would result in clouds the electric tension of which may become very  powerful. M. Peltier produced an illustration of one of these transforma-  tions by making use of a considerable number of very small soap  bubbles, which he subjected, in an insulated capsule of glass, to the  positive action of a globe ; he saw some of these balls elongate, shoot  out, dissolve, and disappear, leaving the rest of the cloud powerfully  charged with positive electricity, a phenomenon which indicated that  all the parts which rushed out and were dissolved were negative.  It appears, also, according to the same philosopher, that observations  may be made in support of this theory when the sky is sprinkled  with cumuli, thin enough to distinguish their interior movements.  In examining one of these thin clouds, we see that each of its  parts changes its position in relation to the others while the evapora-  tion is going on ; and these movements are the more extended the  more rapidly the evaporation proceeds, without, however, being the  same in tlie whole mass. Toward the edge which receives the direct  rays of the sun, the evaporation being greater, the opaque vapor  becomes strongly positive, and we see it attracted towards the earth,  pass below the mass of cloud, and continue there while on the  opposite side the vapor extends and disperses until it is all trans-  formed into elastic vapor, but without the great agitation or lively  repulsion from above to below. Finally ; after a succession of  of warm days, which reproduced a series of transformations of the  opaque into elastic vapors, and vice versa, we may sometimes, by means  of the kite, reach some of those masses of elastic vapors having an  electric tension different from that of the adjacent masses, and strong  enough to neutralize the whole positive current produced in the lower  strata.  This explanation of the electricity of the clouds admits that the  vapor enters the air charged witli negative electricity. The detail  into which we have entered, and the observations on the elec-   346 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTEICITY.  tricity of cascades of water, appear to leave no doubt as to this  fact. On accoiintof the electric repulsion of the globe, and the superior  positive induction to which the vapor from the surface remains subjected,  it preserves its negative state though the first strata of the air in  which it is diffused are generally already very humid and conse-  quently conductors of electricity ; but the presence of this negative  vapor in the air weakens the superior positive, and thus, as M. Peltier  remarks, the indication of the electrometer would decrease in the  cours^e of the day in proportion to the quantity of the vapor which is  eliminated under the contrary tensions of the earth and of space.  Such might also be the cause of the daily variations of this instrument  if its indications were wholly independent of its electric radiation,  and consequently of the conductibility of the air. The primitive  vapor while undergoing the commencement of condensation produces  at first clouds possessing a feeble negative electricity. According to  M. Peltier, these are then subjected to a double electric influence; the  one positive, produced by the celestial space, the other negative and  produced by the earth ; and as it is under this double influence that  the new evaporation takes place, this evidently will produce at first neg-  ative vapor, and afterwards positive vapor, which, in its turn, forms  clouds possessing electricity of the same kind. But would not the  same thing happen supposing the air to be provided with positive  electricity, the intensity of which might vary with the height? In  this case the cloud might experience the induction of the positive elec-  tricity of the strata of the air which are above it, and at the same time  that of the electricity of the air situated below it ; on account of the  increase of the electric intensity with the height, the first action may  be stronger than the second, and supposing the cloud negatively  electrified at first, there would also result an accumulation of the nega-  tive electricity in its higher strata, while the positive electricity pro-  duced by a new decomposition of the natural electricities of the same  cloud would be restored in a great measure in its lower strata. In  this way the first elastic vapor, produced by a new evaporation, might  still be negative, while that which had been last formed might equally  become positive. Only if it be admitted that the molecules of the air  have a positive electricity which is peculiar to themselves, it will happen  that the negative electricity of the primitive vapor may re-combine, in  part or in whole, with the positive electricity of the molecules of the  air, consequently the cloud formed by their condensation will be found  to be positively as well as negatively electrified, or rather be in a neutral  state. In every case the first elastic vapor, owing to a new evaporation  of this cloud, will be found in a negative state, in consequence of the  positive influence of the higher regions of the air. This mode of  regarding the formation of the electric clouds explains also the fre-  quency of the fogs with which the lower strata containing positive  electricity are charged. As for the negative fogs, M. Peltier thought  that they are retained in contact with the earth only in consequence  of their specific gravity, which prevails over the electric repulsion  of the earth, or by the repulsive force due to a current of negative  vapor which, according to the same philosopher, travels from the  equator to the pole.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 347  Â§ IV. Of the distribution of electricity in the clouds.  Experiment shows that electricity is conveyed to the surface of con-  ducting bodies, and that it exhibits no trace of itself in their interior.  We may ask if it is the same with respect to clouds. Ought we to  regard the mass of vesicles which form a cloud as a single body, on  the surface of which all the electricity is distributed, or rather ought  we to admit that during the formation of a cloud each vesicle preserves,  in whole or in part, its atmosphere of electricity ? We are already ac-  quainted with the opinion advanced by M. Gay Lussac on this sub-  ject ; he supposed that the clouds which exhibit certain density are  similar to ordinary conductors and that the electricity is simply con-  veyed to their surface. M. Kaemtz* does not concur in this opinion.  In fact, if it were so, it would be difficult to explain how the clouds can  contain so great a quantity of electricity, as that which is observed in  storms ; how in this case the electricity does not neutralize itself by  a single explosion, or at least by a small number of explosions ; and  finally, how the charges of electricity ane reproduce so numerously  and so close to each other. Besides, the explosions ought to cease  with the first rain, since the communication which this establishes  between the cloud and the earth ought to allow the electricity to  escape freely. It appears more probable to M. Kaemtz that every  vesicle, whether it enters into the composition of a thunder-cloud or not,  preserves a portion of its electricity, and that this portion is greater  the nearer the vesicle is situated to the surface of the cloud. As to  the cause which might thus retain the electricity around each vesicle,  M. Kaemtz found it in the resistance which the electricity must experi-  ence in passing from one vesicle to another, a resistance which is  due to the imperfect conductibility of the air interposed. This  mode of considering the distribution of the electricity in the clouds  does not explain how the vesicles of vapor, electrified in the same  manner, form masses as limited as the clouds are, instead of diffusing  themselves uniformly by their mutual repulsion.  M. Peltier t also regards the vesicles of vapor of which clouds are  composed as surrounded by an electric stratum. \" A cloud,\" says he,  'â– 'â–  is properly not a body such as is usually understood by this word ;  it is not a whole of which the particles are compacted as those of solid  bodies, nor even those of liquids by their adherence or proximity.  Held together with little force the particles of clouds do not readily  permit the propagation of electricity ; the s{)aces which separate  them maintain their isolation and their independence, and it is  only in their condensation, from whatever cause, that their masses  resemble in some slight degree ordinary bodies, and readily transmit  electrical changes. If these particles are widely separated, and  have consequently ]ireserved a great independence, they each re-  tain all their electric energy, the whole tension which they have  acquired, and the mass of vapor will act with a power propor-  â– -' Lebrlnich der Meteorologie, torn.

It will produce only the effects of static elec-  tricity, those of attraction or repulsion, and those of simple radiation.  If, on thu contrary, the particles of vapor are sufficiently near for their  electric spheres to penetrate each other, or if the repulsion of the  electrical spheres act more strongly than the bond which unites  them to the vapor, all the internal particles will lose a portion of  their electricity in favor of the extreme particles ; there will then be  formed around the exterior of the cloudy mass a stratum of free elec-  tricity such as is usually formed around an ordinary conductor.\"  Thus, according to M. Peltier^ the clouds have two kinds of tension;  the tension of free electricity at the surface, and that of the electricity  retained around each of the moleculs of its vapor. From this M.  Peltier sought to explain how vapor could form limited masses,  notwithstanding the mutual repulsion of the particles, owing to the  electric tension of the latter. The tension of the particles repels them  and keeps them at a distance, while the electricity of the surface  attracts them, groups them, and retains them in mass, everywhere  leaving to each its individuality, if the exterior tension is moderate  and proportional to that of the interior. M. Peltier has demonstrated  this repulsive and condensing action from the exterior to the interior,  by the following experiment: He isolated a glass funnel, the tube of  which was one or two millimeters in diameter, and filled it with water,  communicating by means of a conductor with an electric machine.  By allowing the water to escape under the influence of the electricity  furnished by the latter it falls, as we know in rain more or less fine,  according to the electric charge which is given to it. But if a copper  tube of the height of 5 to ten centimetres and of a diameter nearly  equal be placed a little below the orifice of escape, and if it be charged  with the same electricity as the water, instantly the drops of the  latter will approach and unite together in a single stream. This  experiment is rendered more complete by making use of a metallic insu-  lated globe, the diameter of which is pierced with two holes to let in a  ray of light. The water of the funnel being electrified falls into  the globe in a divergent cone. The globe gradually becomes electrified  and reacts on the streams which approach and unite until there is  an equilibrium of reaction between the interior repulsion and that of  the exterior. If the globe communicates with the electrical machine,  the powerful tension immediately reunites the divergent streams into a  single one as in the experiment of the tube.  The electricit}^ which surrounds a cloud could not therefore be formed  of all the electricity which it contains, as that of a metal conductor  which retains no portion in its interior ; it would be, on the contrary,  only a feeble portion dependent on interior reaction and conductibility.  This theory simplifies and facilitates the interpretation of many phe-  nomena which take place during storms; it would be important to  see it confirmed by direct observations, which might be possible by  studying, especially in mountainous countries with the help of kites  sustained by conducting wires, the electrical modifications of the dif-  ferent parts of a cloud. M. Peltier* found in the two kinds of elec-  -- Journal I'Institut, No. 335 and No. 370.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTHICITY. 349  tiical tension existing in the clouds the cause of the different forms  which these bodies assume. \"At first,\" remarks he, \"every vesicle pre-  serves an electric atmosphere like an independent and insulated body ;  then if all the reactions which follow have been in every respect equal,  the vapor should be uniformly diffused ; but it is sufficient that there  are inequalities in the density of the vapor, in order that there should  be inequality in the electrical reactions. The more powerful tensions  distributed in the different points react by repulsion on the internal  vapor ; they condense it, limit it more decidedly, and iorm the first  cloudy flakes. These, acting together as elementary vesicles, form by  their unison masses more complex, called fleeces, separated by in-  tervening clear spaces with jagged edges. Each of these fleeces is sur-  rounded by its own electrical sphere, which reacts on the flakes and  passes them together as the sphere of flakes reacted on the elementary  vesicles. These fleeces, regarded as elements, produce in their turnsfrata  or clouds, properly so called, and then afterwards form the cumuli of  different orders.\" The formation of the cirri reveals also, according to  M. Peltier, another electrical cause, namely, the attractive action of  two masses of vapors or of two separate bodies possessing different  electricities. The vapors interposed and attracted in the longitu-  dinal direction are formed in a line, while their unequal density in  the vertical direction, permitting an unequal distribution of electri-  city, there result lateral repulsions producing, fibrous condensa-  tions of vapors which constitute the cirri. This last effect may be re-  })roduced experimentally by substituting for the vapor small pieces of  gold leaf placed between bodies charged with opposite electricities.  These pieces of gold leaf are formed into line between the two bodies  and constitute threadlike conductors. M. Peltier relates that he like-  wise reproduced a part of this phenomenon with clouds formed of  small soap bubbles.   CHAPTER IV.  OF ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY DURING RAIN, SNOW, AND STORMS.  Â§ 1. â€” Of atmospheric electricity during rain and snoiv.  When a cloud resolves itself into rain, every drop of water conveys  to the electrometer its electric atmosphere, and this attains an elec-  tric tension which is sometimes very considerable. Observers are not  all agreed respecting the changes which the electricity of this instru-  ment indicates, during the fall of rain. Tlius, according to Volta,* the  positive electricity increases on the approach of the cloud, and decrease  atterwards with the fall of the first drops of water, becomes nothing,  and finally passes to a very strong negative state. This electricity  preserves its intensity during half or an entire hour ; but if the rain  continues a longer time it decreases and becomes very feeble ; only it  *Lehrbucli der Mctcorologie von Kacmtz, torn, II, p 418.   350 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.  receives a new addition, every time that the rain increases a few  moments. It would follow, then, from this that rain should, in  general, be negative. According to the English philosopher Foggo,*  the electricity, on the contrary, is positive as long as the cloud which  pours out the rain is at a distance from the zenith of the conductor,  and it only becomes negative when the anterior part of the cloud is  above the conductor. This state then continues during a short space  of time ; after which positive electricity appears anew, and continues  while the cloud is passing over the conductor, to which again succeeds  positive electricity. M. Kaemtz states that he has frequently observed  positive electricity during rains of short duration.  We owe to Schiiblert two regular series of observations relating  especially to the electricity which is exhibited during the fall of rain and  of snow, and which were made, the forraerat EUwangen, from January,  1805, to the month of April, 1806, and the latter at Stuttgard, from  June, 1810, to the month of August of the following year. In the  space of two years and a half Schilbler observed the electricity of 412  falls of rain, snow, &c. According to these observations, it is rare  that there is rain without electricity ; the phenomenon has not been  noticed, except when the electricity of a rain changes from plus to  minus, or the reverse ; then the electricity ceases for several seconds.  The electricity is again at zero at the commencement, or at the  end of a negative rain, as well as at the period of the passage of ordi-  nary positive electricity to that of an equally positive rain, and finally  during a very feeble rain. When the rain falls in a regular and  uniform manner, which is frequently the case, electricity remains  for whole days negative or positive ; it varies simply in its intensity,  which is generally in proportion to the quantity of water which has  fallen. I It is not the same when it rains in an irregular and discon-  nected manner ; the electrometer then exhibits oscillations ; the straws  diverge, fall back, and their divergence is sometimes positive, some-  times negative. 8chiibler remarked that the changes of the sign in  electricity corresponded to the difference either in the size of the drops  of water or in their number. These facts are frequently observed  when isolated waves succeed each other rapidly ; we then frequently  find the electricities positive and negative, successively, in the same  degree of intensity. The electrical phenomena which accompany  the fall of snow are not less complicated ; just as in rain, at every  change which happens, either in the form or size of the snow  flakes, or in their number, there is a corresponding new electrical  state. Schiibler rendered these changes in the intensity and nature  of electricity more evident by making, at very short intervals, suc-  cessive series of observations, which he represented by curves, in  â– which the abscissa expressed the time and the ordinates the cor-  responding intensity of the electricity in the degrees of the elec-  trometer.

J This latter hjis aho been established by Beccaria, Ldtere dell' Ekclridsmo, p. 307.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTEICITY. 351  This relation between the tall of rain and the chan^^es in the electrical  state of the apparatus was observed by M. Arao^o* and M. Peltier. f  Besides, the latter of these two philosophers noticed an electrical fact  which preceded the sudden appearance of hoar-frost, and which tends  to verify the opinion advanced by hira as to the formation of this  body, which he considered, as well as hail, accompanied by electrical  discharges. He states that, before the hoar-frost falls, the needle of  the rheometer of his apparatus may be seen to deviate a number of  degrees, more or less considerable, then all at once retrograde rapidly  and pass from the other side of the zero, as is the case during storms  before a flash of lightning, and at the moment of its appearance. By  means of these indications he ascertained that the approaching fall  of small hailstones could be readily foretold.  The oscillations Avhich are exhibited in the electric state of the elec-  trometer, during the fall of rain or of snow, is particularly worthy of  the attention of observers, since similar effects are produced in the  electrical discharges during storms. AVe may ask, if the indication  of this instrument is really produced by the electricity of the rain.  Schiibler's observations cannot decide this question. In fact they  were made with Volta's electrometer, supplied with a conductor and  an ignited body ; now, when this instrument is exposed to the air  during the fall of rain it is subjected at once to the influence of the  electricity of the air, which is always positive, to that of the electri-  city of the cloud from which the rain falls, and which may be positive  or negative ; and finally to the electricity of the rain which strikes on  it. The following observation of M. Peltier| may throw some light on  this subject: \" On the 8tli of June,\" as this observer states, \"toward  four o'clock in the evening I had a descending current, the rain began  about five o'clock. There were several negative and positive alterna-  tions in the direction of the current. The water which fell did not  change its sign as the current did, it always gave negative indications  to the electroscope.\"  To ascertain what in the indications of the electrometer is due to  the electricity contained in the rain when it comes in contact with  the ground, it is necessary to withdraw the instrument from the elec-  trical influence of the clouds, as well as that of the air. Perhaps it  may be ascertained by receiving the rain into an insulated metal vase,  which may be made to communicate with an electrometer without by  a stern placed in the inside of an apartment. It is well known that  in this case the instrument is protected from the electrical influence  of the air, as well as from that of the clouds.  We have already said that the electricity of the electrometer ac(j[uires  during the fall of rain a tension superior to that of the clear sky. If  we reter to the observations made by Schiibler, at Stuttgardt, from  1811 to 1812, the intensity of the electricity of the rain and the snow  presents an annual period, the stronger electricity taking place in the  summer, the feebler in the winter. This is what is indicated in the  following table, which gives the mean force of the two electricities for  ' Traite de I'Electri. et du Maj^n., par Becquerel, torn.

This stronger electricity accompanies showers â€” always  transient rains and storms.  We have seen above that Volta in general found that the elec-  tricity of the rain which he observed was negative. If in Schiibler's  observations, of which we have already given a summary, we re-  capitulate separately the number of days of rain or snow during  which the electricity has been positive or negative, we find, on the  contrary, 71 days positive and 69 negative, that is to say almost  the same number of positive as negative days. The observations made  by Hemmer,t at Mannheim, from 1783 to 1787, lead to the same  result; he found these two numbers in the ])roportion of 1 to 1.08.  According to the observations of M. Arago,;{; during the first seven  months of 1830, there were eleven days of rain without electricity,  six days with positive electricity, and eight days with negative electri-  city. From the collective result of these different observations, we   â– ~\" To obtain the numbers contained in this table, Schiibler noted separately the degrees  of positive electricity and those of negative electricity. Where the electricities of different  nature alternated, he added apart the degrees observed and corresponding to the rains or  snows, positive as well as negative: and, if one of these two electricities preponderated,  he kept a proportional account. When a rain or snow gave signs of only one electricity,  but with a varial>le intensity, he placed it at the higher degree in the account. Finally,  be did not measure the electric tension beyond 600 degrees of the straw electrometer; then  the electricity began to give out sparks, and a small Leyden phial, which was charged  with free air. gave quite powerful shocks.  f Lehrbnch der Metcorologie, von Kaemtz, tom.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.   353   might conclude that the electricity of rain or snow is sometimes posi-  tive and sometimes negative, and this nearly for the same number of  times. But we ought to observe that the two other series of observa-  tions by Schiibler* do not exhibit the same result ; of the 412 observa-  tions of wliich they are composed, the rain or snow was 161 times posi-  tive and 251 times negative, that is to say^ in the proportion of 100 to  155. It would appear, even according to these observations, that the  winds were not without influence on the kind of electricity with which  the air was efiected. In fact, in grouping the positive rains and the  negative ones according to the directions of the winds, Schiibler found  the following results :   Winds.   Number of posir  tivo rains.

These observations concur in showing that the rains which foil  â€¢while the north winds are prevalent are more frequently positively  electrified than negatively, while the contrary is exhibited by the  south winds. The maximum coincides with the north wind and the  minimum with the S. or SW. wind.  Although in fSchubler's observations, mentioned above, the pro-  portion of the number of days of positive rain to that of days of nega-  tive rain was as 100 to 155, yet the mean force of the positive electri-  city was greater than that of the negative in the proportion of 69 to 43.  This superiority of positive over negative electricity was observed in  all the winds, as may be seen by the following table, in which the  mean forces of the two electricities are given for each :   Winds.

Besides,  it is evident that an explanation ought not be hazarded until these  first observations shall be confirmed by new observations, in which  the indications furnished by the instruments shall be more in accord-  ance with the actual intensity of the electricity which is to be  measured.  Â§ 2. â€” 0/ atmospheric electricity during storms.  Atmospheric electricity has its greatest tension in stormy weather,  and is often so great that the instruments are insufiScient to measure  it. The currents are sometimes so intense that they demagnetize the  needles of the rheometers, and tear in pieces the gold leaves of the  electrometers.* This powerful tension is exhibited also by the flashes  of lightning, the sparkling rain, and the luminous effects which  appear at the extremities of conducting bodies.  These observations concur in showing that electricity undergoes  frequent and sudden variations in its nature as well as in its intensity  ^ Comptes Rendus, tome III, page 147, and tome XIII, page 211. 1836 and 1841.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 355  during the wliole time a storm lasts. Volta,* who directed his atten-  tion to these variations, states that he observed as many as fourteen  changes of sign in the space of one minute by exposing his electro-  meter to the action of thunder clouds ; and, according to De Saussure,t  these changes follow each other in some cases with such rapidity that  we hav^e not time to record them. Schilblerl has also made some ob-  servations, which define these electric variations better than any one  had done before him ; they teach us that the electricity of the electro-  meter gradually increases in proportion as the storm draws near ; that  it reaches its maximum when the storm is nearest to the point of ob-  servation. Independently of these gradual changes, it also under-  goes others, which are exhibited in a sudden manner at the moment  of the appearance of every flash of lightning ; finally, that this last  phenomena produces, also, in the electricity a sudden passage from  one state to another of an almost equal intensity. To study the  course of the electricity during storms, Schlibler made a series of ob-  servations at very close intervals of time, and he represented the  result by a curve, as in his observations on the electricity of rain and  snow.  To show how complicated are the electric phenomena, we here  quote the detail^ of observations made during two storms â€” one of  which passed at a distance^ the other appeared directly over the zenith  of observation :  \"April 11, ISOG. â€” In the day the electricitj' of the iiir is feebly positive, and tlio t.e:a-  pertiture ro?e to 1 1Â° R.  \"C o'clock, evening. â€” It began to rain; tlie electricity became negative.  \" 7 o'clock, evening. â€” The rain ceased; dark cloud covers the sk}-, and a storm shows itself  in the horizon on the southeast. The electricity is still negative; it decreases suddenly  â– with the flashes of lightning, every one of them producing, in the straws of an electro-  meter, an approach, followed by a new divergence, but less than that which took place  the moment before.  \"7 o'clock li minutes, evening. â€” A flash of lightning suddenly reduces the electricity to  zero, but causes it to pass for an instant to the positive state ; it afterwards becomes  negative.  \"7 o'clock 18 mimdes, evening. â€” The electricity becomes positive, and remains so from this  instant till that in which the storm appears to be neurerest; the positive electricity goes on  increasiug ; v/itli every flash of lightning the straws diverge, to fall back almost immedi-  ately, yet preserving every time a greater divergence than what they before had.  \"7 o'clock 45 minutes, evening. â€” The storm moves in the direction of the northeast ; the  positive electricity decreases, and the flashes of lightning are more rare.  \" 8 o'clock 4 minuks, evening. â€” Tlie electricity is at zero ; but a rain which follows causes  it anew to pass to the ntgative state ; nothing more is perceived of the storm.  \" J/-yy 14, 1813. â€” During the day the temperature rose to -|-1GÂ° 3 R ; the baromct^jr  is several lines below its mean ; the wind blows lightly from the SE., and the electricity  has a feeble positive tension.  \" 4 o'clock 40 minutes, evening â€” A storm rising on the horizon in the SW. ; the positive  electricity increases with every flash of lightning, but more rapidly than in the fust storm ;  great drops of water fall.  \" 4 o'cUtck 47 minutes, nening. â€” The storm is nearer ; its distance appears about 4,000 feet.  A very vivid flash of lightning, followed by a peal of thunder, suddenly changes the  positive to negative electricity, of a nearly eijual intensity ; at the same time there  occurrs a heavy shower. From thi.s point, and wJiile the storm passed to the NW., the  negative electricity presented a course opposite to that taken by the positive electricity.  The rain continued.  \" 3 o'clock 4 minutes, evening. â€” The electricity became positive anew.  t Journal de Physique, tome LIX, page 296. 1809.  + Voyages dans les A'fes, tome II, Â§ 801, page 220.  Â§ Journal de Sclr.veigger, tome IJ, page 377.   356 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.  \"5 o'clock 12 minutes, evening. â€” The electricity becomes negative.  \"5 o'clock IS minutes, evening. â€” The electricity decreases considerably with the rain ; but  continued negative, and this for a long time, after the rain had completely ceased.\"  The sudden passage from the strongest positive to the strongest nega-  tive electricity is certainly the most remarkable fact in the electrical  variations which were exhibited while the last storm continued.  Schiibler observed that this phenomenon is not rare in stormy weather,  and it ordinarily occurs after vivid flashes of lighting or during the  sudden showers which often accompany them. This remark of the  German philosopher is confirmed by the observations of M. Peltier,*  made by means of the rheometer. \"On the 16th of June, 1836,\"  he writes to the Academy of Sciences of Paris, \"I was awakened at  two o'clock fifteen minutes in the morning; a storm was raging on  all sides ; I ran to my instruments ; they denoted 80Â° of a negative  descending current ; the vivid flashes of lightning produced only ten  to fifteen degrees of decrease of deviation. At 2 o'clock 30 minutes  the negative current denoted 70Â°, when a very powerful flash of light-  ning occurred ; the needle whirled about and stopped at 80Â° on the  other side, where it remained thirty seconds ; then it returned to 70Â°.  The storm passed ofi* about 2 o'clock 45 minutes ; the needle returned  to its zero ; then passed to the positive side, where it remained.\"  The sudden changes which occurred in the intensity of the electricity  at tlie instant of the appearance of the flashes of lightning were  also observed by this philosopher. He speaks thus on this sub-  ject in the same note: \"The storm of August 4, 1836, was entirely  diflerent from any other ; at 2 o'clock in the morning the electricity  was at first positive and then negative ; the needle advanced gradu-  ally towards its maximum ; then a flash of lightning occurred, and  the needle fell back half way ; then recommenced its ascending course  until the next flash of lighting, which made it retrograde. The  progressive course so entirely coincided with the electric changes  that I could foretell them by the fall of rain detaching itself from the  cloud.\"  We have already said that Volta and De Saussure observed the  frequent succession of the two electricities exhibited by the elec-  trometers when they were exposed to the action of thunder clouds.  This frequency of the phenomenon did not escape M. Peltier's obser-  vation, who cites, among others, the storm of the 6th of August,  1836, as having exhibited to him at least twenty-five changes. Voltaf  sought for the cause of these changes in the electrical induction which  thunder clouds must naturally exercise on each other. If it be sup-  posed that while a cloud positively electrified produces in the electro-  meter a positive divergence, another cloud possessing a stronger  electricity, but of a contrary nature, happens to come above the  former, the electricity of the stronger will, according to Yolta, neu-  tralize, at a distance, that of the weaker, and will drive, into its lower  part, the electricity opposite to that which existed there at first ;^ or  rather the morepowertul electricity, after having caused the neutralizing  '- Oomptes Rendus, tome III, page 147.  â– j- Journal de Physique, tome LXIX, page 343.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 357  of the opposite electricity, will, by virtue of its excess, act directly  on the instrument placed at the surface of the earth, producing there a  negative divergence. If, aiterwards, these two clouds happen to sej^arate  from each other, the electrometer must exhibit the positive divergence  which it at first had. We may conceive, says Volta, that these clouds,  driven by the wind and the different currents of air which appear  everywhere to exist in stormy weatlier, undergo a sort of fluctuating  movement sufficient to cause the various electric states which are  observed in the electrometer. For the purpose of reproducing, by ex-  l^eriment, an imitation of this phenomenon, Volta placed, horizontally,  one below the other, two disks of metal,, insulated and movable,  charged with opposite electricities. As the distance that se})arated  them was very great, the lower disk, which was negative, produced^  in an electrometer placed below it, a negative divergence ; but in  proportion as the same disk was raised or the other was lowered the  negative signs gradually decreased till they sunk to zero, after which  the opposite electricity was manifested.  It is very probable that a great number of changes which are  observed in electricity during storms are only effects similar to those  under discussion. If we unite to them the numerous discharges  which, in disturbing the electrical equilibrium at every moment, modify  the action, of induction, to which the instruments are subjected, we  shall, without difficulty, coD:>prehend that the numerous oscillations  ought to be exhibited in the intensity as well as in the nature of their  electricity. M. Peltier* thoui^ht that these oscillations might also  result from the partial electrical changes which take place from the  interior towards the exterior of a thunder cloud. In fact, we have sc.>n  that, in the way shown by this philosopher, the partial conductability  of the clouds gives to them distinct atmospheres â€” the one exterior  and a great number of others interior. When the external atmo-  sphere has escaped by an instantaneous discharge, all the internal  masses, which have their own atmospheres, restore gradually to the  surface the electricity which it had lost. These partial changes which  follow the external discharge of a cloud must be manifest to the in-  struments placed at the surface of the earth, if the latter have an  adequate sensibility; for example, in an electrometer we see the leaves  spring out, open, close suddenly, or strike against the armatures  without any explosion being heard.  It is after a certain number of these partial discharges that we see  the flash of lightning which indicates the discharge from the surface,  after which the internal exchanges recommence, and with them the  oscillations of the electrometer.  We design to state in the second part of this memoir all the results  to which the observations hitherto made on atmospheric electricity  lead, in order to present in the same outline the state of our knowledge  of this branch of meteorology. We may remark that among these  results some of them are derived from observations too limited in  number to definitively take rank in science, and that as to others,  they were obtained by means of too imperfect instruments, or those of  ^ Ann. dc Chira. ct de rhj'sifiue, 3d series, tome IV, page 423.   358 ATMOSPHEEIC ELECTRICITY.  â– which the indications were complicated by elements foreign to those  sought; in the mean time we await new observations which may  serve to correct them. It is only by means of many series of regular  observations, made with proper instruments, that wo can hope to  illustrate, and resolve the various questions which are raised by the  results under discussion.  Confining ourselves to the province of the historian, we proceed to  give in the last part of our task an epitome of the information hitherto  gained relative to the phenomena of lightning.   PART III.  SUMMABY OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF LIGHTNING.  CHAPTEE I.  OF THE FLASHES OF LIGHTNING.  When the two electricities accumulated in the contiguous portions of  two clouds, or of a cloud and a body placed within its sphere of activity  at the surface of the earth, have a,cquired a tension capable of over-  coming the resistance the air opposes to their union, an electrical  explosion takes place, and we see the lightning dart through the air  under different forms, such as, according to M. Arago,* diffused flashes,  linear and zigzag streams, and globular masses ; the latter having a  progressive motion.  Some attempts have been made by Helvigf to determine the velocity  of the linear flashes of lightning. His observations by means of the  camera lucida have led him to attribute to them a velocity of 40,000  or 50,000 feet in a second ; but, as Messrs. Pfaff and Kaemtz| observe,  so many illusions may have existed in the mode of observation pur-  sued by this philosopher that we can only consider this data as a  rough approximation. But we know, according to the beautiful expe-  riments of Mr. Wheatstone^Â§ that the velocity with which the electric  fluid passes through a conducting wire is about 115,000 leagues per  second, and we may conceive that the velocity of linear discharges of  lightning must be the same. [This does not follow.]  The length of these flashes does not appear to be well known ; we have  only a single direct determination of this element. In a storm which  happened on the 2d of May, 1839, M, Weigsenborn,|l of Weimar,  counted 19 seconds as the time comprised between the appearance of  '-' Anmiaire du Bureau des Longitudes pour I'an 1838, pp. 249, 255, 257.  t Annales de Gilbert, torn.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 359  a horizontal flash of lightning and the commencement of the report,  and he found that the angle emhraced by the two extremities of this  flash was 75Â°. By means of these data he calculated the length of  the flash observed to be more than 8,932 metres â€” that is to sa}^, more  than 2 leagues. M. Arago,* in his notice of thunder, points out a  very ingenious method of oljtaining if not the true lengths of the flashes,  at least the limit within which these lengths must be contained ;  but this method rests on the hypothesis that the duration of the  peal of thunder is the time which its sound requires to pass through a  space equal to the diflerence in length of the two lines, drawn from  the ear of the observer to the two extremities of the flash. In apply-  ing it to some observations, M. Arago found for certain flashes the  lengths of at least 3.3, of 3.4, and 3.8 leagues. So great a length,  naturally leads us to admit that the electricity vrhich forms the flash  is incomparably greater than that which can be accumulated in the  most powerful batteries. But M. day Lussacf observes that we cannot  really judge of the relative intensity of the electricity accumulated on  our conductors and in a thunder cloud by the length of the sparks, since  the former are very good conductors of electricity, and are surrounded  by air, which in its usual state has little conducting power, while the  clouds are tolerably good conductors, and the surrounding air, rarified  and saturated Avith moisture, nossesses in a considerable degree the  power of conducting electricity. The portion of vapor with which  the air enveloping the cloud is probably more or less charged appeared  to M. Pouillet| capable of serving as a medium to produce a discharge,  in the same manner that metallic powders, spread on woolen or silk  cloth, cause the spark of our machines to be projected to a greater dis-  tance. In order to explain the length of the discharge of lightning he  supposes that in the course v/hich it is to take there are patches of vapor,  and possibly even those of air, already electrified by the contrary  induction of the electricities which have a tendency to rueh against  each other, and that at a given moment the equilibrium is finally  broken without there having been any transfer of the fluid of one  cloud to another^ but simply the successive transfer of the electricity  of one patch to another over the whole path of the discharge.  M. Lara6Â§ explains the length of the flashes of lightning by supposing  that it may be the result of the small excess of the conductibility of the  clouds over that of the air between them, and consequently the free  electricity of feeble tension, diffused at their surface, may be discharged  between two clouds at several points at once, and successively between,  different portions of each one of these clouds.  It is known that the zig-zag form is common to the flash of light-  ning and to the electric spark. Helvig]| sought to determine the exact  form by means of a camera lucida, and, according to this observer, it  ~' Anmiaire pour 1838, p. 459.  t Annales de Chimic et dc Physique, torn.

But it would not be without interest  to science to have more certain data as to the form of linear discharges  of lightning, and the more so as it is thought that some connexion  lias been discovered between this form and the peals of thunder.  Possibly the property which certain substances possess of becoming  instantaneously phosphorescent under the influence of the light de-  veloped by an electrical discharge, and this at the distance of several  yards, as M, Becquerel has shown, f might furnish means of obtain-  ing phosphorescent impressions of the streaks of lightning, and thus  determine all the irregularities which the discharge exhibits in its  course through the air.  It may be asked, What is the cause which produces the zig-zag forms  of lightning ? AVithout stopping to consider the hypothesis of Lo-  gan,! ^^^^^ regarded them as the result of irregular refractions which  the atmospheric vapors and the clouds cause the rays of light to  undergo, we shall remark that two different explanations have been  given of this phenomenon. According to the first, which is by  Parrot, Â§ it is produced by alternate portions of the air, more or less  humid, and consequently of more or less conducting power, which the  electrical substance meets in its passage, and which oppose to it unequal  resistances in different directions. It is true that the atmosphere  contains a great variety of exhalations, and particularly of watery  vapor irregularly diffused ; besides this explanation agrees with  the phenomenon which lightning presents at the surface of the earth,  where we see it leave bodies which are poor conductors of electricity  for those which offer it a more ready passage ; but this explanation  is considered insufficient, because it cannot be applied to the ordi-  nary electric spark. In fact, in the narrow space which separates  a body from the conductor of the electric machine, we cannot regard  the air of a chamber as presenting strata alternately dry and moist,  and yet the spark none the less pursues a sinuous course.  The second explanation, which is more generally admitted, is based  on the resistance which compressed air opposes to the motion of  electricity. Atmospheric air being a slight conductor of electricity,  it is natural to suppose that the electricity, in passing through it,  drives before it the molecules of which it is composed, from whence  results, successively, compressions along the whole line through which  the discharge takes place. This effect of an electric discharge is also  confirmed by the known experiment of Kinnersley. Compressed air  opposing a greater resistance, the electricity will follow the path along  which the air is less condensed, and will deviate from its direction in  a straight line to traverse that of a broken line.  Linear discharges of lightningordinarily take placebetween the clouds;.  Â« Beibriige zur Witterungskunde, p. 353. Leipzig, 1820.  t Coiuptes Kendus, torn.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 361  \"but it is not rare to see them launch out from one group of clouds to  another; sometimes, even, the electric fluid, after several zig-zag move-  ments, returns toward the region from whence it came. This last  phenomenon is frequently observed in volcanic clouds.* Exact obser-  vations place it bej'ond doubt that streaks of lightning sometimes  become forked, and are divided into three branches, which often sepa-  rate to points very remote from each other. f  Mr. FaradayJ has given a new and ingenious explanation of the  phenomena. As he regards them, the different forms which the flashes  of lightning take do not belong to the discharges, but to the edges  of the clouds behind which they are produced. Let any one imagine  a dark cloud, presenting an irregular and well defined border, placed  between the eye of the observer and the place of electrical discharge;  at the moment when this is effected the cloud will present an illu-  minated edge, similar to the shining edge which it would exhibit  were it placed between the sun and the observer. Such may be, in  many cases, the cause of the apparent form of the flashes ; what the  observer really sees being only the irregular outline of a cloud.  Mr. Faraday states that he has frequently been able to verify this  opinion, and according to him, we are thus to explain the branching of  the discharges of lightning, their return to the region from whence  they came, and also the remarkable phenomenon of the flashes having  frequently exactly the same form and succeeding each other rapidly  in the same point of the sky, without, however, being produced by the  same electrical discharge. We readily believe that illusions of this  kind sometimes take place ; but we have observed the branching of the  lightning exhibited under such circumstances that it becomes difficult,  not to say impossible, to apply the explanation of the learned English  philosopher. For example, the Abbe KichardÂ§ states that he saw a  luminous discharge, single at its departure from the cloud, divide itself  in two at some distance from the earth, and each half strick a separate  object. Here is certainly a case of forking in which the bright line  delineated in the space belonging clearly to the discharge of lightning.  The streaks of lightning are not always of the same color. Those  which present themselves under the form of a narrow winding dis-  charge are, in general, white ; they have sometimes been observed,  but rarely, of a purplish violet or bluish tinge. The light of the dif-  fused flashes of lightning neither presents this whiteness nor an  equal brilliancy ; its tint is often of a very intense red, sometimes  mixed with blue or violet. Sometimes it appears only to illumine the  edges of the clouds; at others it includes their whole superficial ex-  extent. The differences which are observed in the intensity and color  of the light of the flashes may depend upon several causes, among  which we must reckon more or less the density and moisture of the  stratum of the air in which the clouds are found, as well as its greater  or less degree of conductibility. In fact, experiment proves that   * Philosophical Transactions for 1795, Ist part, p. 73.  t Aunuaire for 183S, p. 252; Dictionnaire de Gehler, torn. T, p. 1000; and Lehrbuch der  Meteorologie, torn.

The electrical sparks of our machines have  also different appearances, and especially vary their color according  to the hygrometric state of the air. They are also generally the  more brilliant the better the substances between which they take  place conduct electricity. Finally, in the electric explosion occurring  between the strata of a cloud lying above another^ it may happen, as M.  Kaemtz* observes, that on account of the thickness of the lower cloud  the light of the flashes, however intense it may be supposed, produces  on the eye of the observer only a feeble and diffused light.  The experiments of Mr. Wheatstone show that the duration of the  linear streaks of lightning and of dift'used flashes does not exceed the  thousandth part of a second. It is not the same with the globular dis-  charges, which are sometimes visible for several seconds, and pass from  the clouds to the earth with sufficient slowness for the eye plainly to  follow their course and ascertain their velocity. Their existence  appears to be now well established. Schiiblerf and M. Kaemtz| men-  tion flashes of lightning which had the appearance of a current of fire as  large as the arm, terminated by a much larger and more brilliant ball ;  and MunckeÂ§ saw a discharge which descended vertically, and which  must have been about 200 feet long, transformed, under his eyes, into  a great number of small balls. These globular discharges, which some-  times leave along their passage inflamed portions, appear frequently  in the midst of volcanic storms ;|| the same is the case with linear  streaks of lightning ; they often become subdivided, and after their  explosion the}'' commonly leave a strongly sulphurous smoke. We  are as yet ignorant of the cause of the formation of these meteors ; they  seem to be the agglomerations of ponderable substances strongly  charged with electricity. M. Arago^ thought that it might not be  impossible that the lightning in passing through the air sometimes  produces instantaneously a sort of half union of substances which may  exist in this medium, and thus produce these globular discharges.  There are many facts which favors this opinion. First, it is established  that lightning, when on its passage through the air, produces chemical  combinations, as is proved by the presence of nitric acid in the rain  â– water gathered during storms.** Then the observations of M. Fusi-  Dieri,tt confirmed by those of M. Boussingault, on the presence of  metallic iron, of iron in different degrees of oxydation, and of sulphur  in the powdery deposits which surround the orifices in the bodies  through which lightning has forced a passage ; the fact that hail-  stones have for a nucleus small fragments of sulphuret of iron,|J the  \"\" Lehrbuch der Meteorologie, tome IT, p. 42D.  f Journal de Schweigger, tome XLI, p. 36; ]82i.

[It is more probable that  these substances are carried immediately up from the earth by the force  of the discharge. â€” J. H ] The existence of the deposits, of which  we have spoken above, proves that lightning conveys these bodies.  Besides it is known that the ordinary electric spark may also convey  ponderable substances in a state of great tenuity. It may happen then  that the lightning, in passing through the air, may induce a com-  mencement of the union of the different substances which it contains^  and that the electricity concentrated there by their conductibility may  appear under a form more or less globular. Nev/ experiments and new  observations, however, can only assign the proper value which this  opinion should have in science.   C H A P T E R II .  OF THUNDEK.   As is the case with every electric explosion, the flash of lightning  is accoDjpanied by a noise more or less intense of longer or shorter  duration, to which is given the name of thunder. This noise varies  with the distance of the observer from the place where the electrical  discharge takes place ; if it is very near, the flash is almost immediately  followed by successive and rapid detonations, but at a little distance  these detonations are replaced by a sort of reverberation^ which lasts for  several seconds, and which is frequently intermingled with violent ex-  plosions. Physicists generally are agreed in considering the thunder as  the result of the sudden re-entrance of the air into an empty space, thus  likening the phenomenon to what happens in the experiment known as  the burst bladder, but they differ in opinion as to the manner in  which this void is produced. x\\ccording to some, the flash of lightning  is always attended with the sudden formation of rain, and the vapor  contained in a large space being suddenly condensed, it must form in  the atmosphere, almost instantaneously, a void into which the strata of  surrounding air rush by virtue of their elastic force. This rapid motion  will produce a loud noise, and as the portions of the atmosphere  which have filled the void formed by the condensation of vapor leave  in their turn an unoccupied space, new strata of air will rush into  this latter, producing a nev/ report, and so on.  It is conceived, also, that the intensity of the explosions must become  weakened, since, on the one hand, the cause which produces them  loses its intensity, and, on the other, because they take place at dis-  tances more or less remote from the observer. To this we may reduce  in substance tiie opinions advanced by De Luc,* Girtanner,t Mayer,  and Monge.j;  *^ Idues 8ur la M^te'orologie, torn. II, page 150. Paris, ]787.  t Dictionnaire de Gehler, torn. I, pages 5G8 and 5G9.  X Encyclopedic Moderne, torn. XXII, page 319. Brussels, 1832.   364 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITr.  This explanation is in accordance with the violent showers which  ordinarily attend the loud peals of thunder, but numerous objections  have been made to it whicli are difficult to answer in a satisfactory  manner. We do not see, for example, why the rapid condensation of  vapor into rain should not always be attended by thunder. On the  other hand, it has been established that there is sometimes formed, in  a perfectly clear sky, a single cloud, the appearance of which is imme-  diately followed by the rapid formation of several other clouds, which  spread in a short time over the whole extent of the sky without thunder  being heard.  Other philosophers have sought for the cause of thunder in the  vacuum generated by the lightning in its passage through the air.  Kinnersley's thermometer and many electrical effects prove that the  electricity, in traversing the air, drives aside the portions which it  meets, producing a momentary void, into which immediately after the  surrounding air rushes, wi! n a violence which depends on the intensity  of the electricity. Hencj the prolonged noise of thunder is the report  from all points of the discharge. This explanation was combatted  by M. Pouillet,* who remarked that, if this were the cause of thunder,  the passage of a cannon ball in the air ought to produce a similar  noise, while there is heard from it only a sort of hissing. This  philosopher contends that when the spark passes between two bodies  the electric fluid experiences no movement of transfer like that of the  projectiles of ponderable matter, but that there are decomposition and  recompositions of electricity along all the path of the discharge, and  consequently there is a vibration more or less violent in the pon-  derable matter â€” a vibration which M. Pouillet compares to a kind of  tearing apart, or quick separation, as, for example, in the experiment  of the perforated card. According to him, the noise is the result of  this vibration which afterwards is propagated in all the surrounding  mass.  On the subject of this explanation M. Becquerelf observes that  there is no proof of the agitation of the particles of the air being  sufficient to produce the noise of thunder ; and as for the objection  drawn from the motion of the ball, as the circumstances are not the  same, the velocity of the ball being appreciable, while that of elec-  tricity is not so, he thinks that the effects ought not to be alike in the  two cases. The velocity of electricity being nearly infinite compared  to that of the ball, the vibration of the air must be vastly more in-  tense, and there is nothing to prevent the contractions and expan-  sions of the air from producing detonations with reverberation.  The explanation which attributes the sound of the thunder to the  sudden re-entrance of the air into the void produced by the lightning is  regarded by M. TessanJ as insufficient, and we owe to this obicrver some  new ideas on the formation of this sound. According to him a gaseous  conducting body, such as a cloud, changes its form and volume, and  which its surface is externally subjected from the surrounding dry air  consequently its density, when it is electrified, because the pressure to  '' EMments de Physique et de Me'tcorologie, torn.

ATMOSPHEEIC ELECT2ICITY. 365  decreases in proportion as the electrical charge increases, and because  the expansion of the electrical clouds is always such tint their own  elastic force, added to the expansion of the electric fluid, is found to be  in every point equal to the external atmospheric pressure. Now, if in  this state an electric discharge bursts from a cloud, the external air  being no longer retained by the expansive force of the electric fluid  which produces the equilibrium will rush from all parts towards the  cloud. There will be a condensation and a driving back of the sur-  rounding particles, and consequently a report. Such would be, accord-  ing to M. Tessan, the explanation of thunder, and the shower that  follows it.  A question, the solution of wdiich possibly may not be without  some importance in the explanation of thunder, is the existence of  flashes of lightning without noise. Many observations tend to prove  its existence ; and first, do we not often perceive, even in a clear sky,  in the beautiful nights of summer, gleams more or less vivid which  are termed heat lightning, and which are not distinguished from  the flashes of ordinary lightning except that they are not attended  by thunder ? It is true some philosophers regard these flashes of  heat lightning as the reflection on atmospheric strata more or less  elevated, of the flashes of common lightning produced in thunder clouds  hidden by the convexity of the earth. Experiments mentioned by M.  Arago* prove tliat the feeble light which results from the kindling of  several ounces of powder is reflected very perceptibly by the atmo-  sphere ; we may then admit that the reflection, infinitely more bright,  of distant flashes of lightning must produce similar effects. Moreover,  we may observe that there exist observations which directly demon-  strate the possibility of this explanation, We find in De Saussure'sf  work that on the night of the 10th or 11th of July, 1783, this philo-  sopher, finding himself at the hospital of the Grimsel, with a calm and  clear sky, saw near the horizon, in the direction of Geneva, several  bands of clouds from which darted forth flashes of lightning that pro-  duced no noise. Now, the same night and at the same moment the  city of Geneva experienced a most terrific storm. But if heat light-  ning appears sometimes to derive its origin from atmospheric reflec-  tion, observation shows that in many cases we cannot attribute it to  distant storms. Among others, Schiiblerl states that in some parts  of Wurtemberg, over an extent of more than 400 square leagues, there  were observed on the night of the 26th of August, 1823, from nine to  eleven o'clock, flashes of lightning in a sky perfectly clear, without the  slighest storm appearing in that whole extent of coimtry. Besides, the  fact that heat lightning is sometimes seen entirely around the horizon,  may alone suffice to demonstrate that it is impossible always to explain  it thus; for it would be necessary to suppose that storms exist at the  same instant and in all directions, from the centre at which the ob-  server is placed in a calm and clear atmosphere, a supposition which  is scarcely admissible. We may remark again that if heat lightning  ordinarily shows itself on the edge of the horizon, it is also sometimes  Â»â€¢ Annuaire pour 18o8, p. 429. f Voyages dans les Alpes, torn.

A number of physisists likewise regard tliis phe-  nomenon as existing by itself indepgndently of sforms.*  Besides these flashes of heat lightning, frequently in cloudy weather  very bright flashes may be seen to pass through the clouds without  being followed by any noise. f Perhaps it might bo said that the storm  is at too great a distance from the observers to hear the thunder, since,  according to the calculations of M. Aragot a distance of three, four or  five leagues is sufficient wholly to deaden the noise of the detonations  of the lightning. But to this it may be answered, that during the  same storm and in the same clouds frequent flashes of lightning are  observed to gleam forth, a small number of which only are accom-  panied b}'' thunder. It is true that M. Delez3nneÂ§ has given, in a  similar case, an explanation, based on the phenomenon of interference  of the waves of sound ; but if this explanation is applicable to the case  in which a flash of lightning without thunder is followed by another  accompanied with noise, we cannot see how it can be admitted when  numerous flashes of lightning succeed each other in silence. Now if  it were Avell established that there are flashes of lightning without  thunder, would not their existence be irreconcilable with the expla-  nation which regards the sudden re-entrance of the air into the void  left by the flash of lightning as the physical cause of thunder? Obser-  vations on cases of lightning supposed to be witliout thunder, giving  the heights and distances of the clouis, in which they appear, might  therefore throw some light on the question of the theory of thunder.  Another fact which, if it were confirmed by new observations,  would be no less important in regard to this theory, is that of  the hissing noise by which a flash of lightning was attended, in a  storm whicli raged on the road from Avignon to Remoulin on the night  of the 18th or 19th of September, 1840. \"A flash of lightning,\"  says M. Tessan|| in reporting this observation, \"'caused a loud hissing  sound, attended by a terrific crash of thunder. The flash, the hissing,  and the crash appeared to me simultaneous, as well as to two persons  v/ho were with me in the front part of the stage coach ; I, however,  believe that it was rather in the order just mentioned in which the  sensations succeeded each other.\"  Whatever explanation of thunder we adopt, we must not neglect  to take into account two remarkable circumstances, which are its  long duration and the successive decrease as well as increase of intensity  which are so frequently renewed during the reverberations of the same  peal. In discussing the point as to what effect echoes may be considered  â€¢~ Schiibler thinks tliat the flashes of heat lightning are only irradiations of insulated  clouds, surcharged with electricity. M. Mattenci has sought for the cause in the electricity  accumulated at the surface of cert.ain portions of the earth which have become insidated,  either bj' the nature of the soil which compose them, or by the effect of the evaporation  which has dried them up. Finally, Bnmdes believed that the phenomenon of heat light-  ning has some relation to the falling stars. â€” See Lehrbuch der ileteorologie von Kaemtz,  torn.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 367  to have in producing these phenomena, M. Arago* remarks that there  is little hope of arriving at anything decisive on this subject. lie  cites the echoes which have continued during half a minute from the  sound of the discharge of a pistol, and from the observations he has  been able to collect, the longest peals of thunder are not more than  thirty-six, forty-one, and forty-five seconds. The objection has been  made that sailors hear the rolling of thunder in the open sea Avhere  then there is no terrestrial object capable of reflecting the sound ; but  observation proves that clouds possess, like other bodies, the property  of producing the reflection of sound. f Nevertheless a remark seems to  prove, according to M. Arago, that the rolling of thunder does not  always result from simple reflected sound when the flashes of lightning  succeed each other in a sky uniformly cloudy. Some are attended by  long reverberations while others are followed only by short and sharp  peals. It is evident that these remarkable differences cannot be ex-  plained by considering the rolling of the thunder as a simple phe-  nomenon of echo.  Recourse has been had to another consideration derived from the  inec|uality of time which the noise, produced by the displacement ot  the air in the different points along the course of a flash of lightning,  takes to reach the ear by which it is perceived. Dr. Eobert IlookeJ  appears to be the first who observed this circumstance ; according to  him the different portions of the long line of the flash being in  general at different distances, the sounds generated, whether succes-  sively or simultaneously, will require different or unequal times to  reach the ear of the observer. Hence the length of the flash of lightning  v.'ould determine the duration of a peal of thunder, and to an observer  placed under the line of a flash of lightning, near its middle, the  same peal would produce reverberations only half as long as to one  placed at the extremity of the flash. This explanation, based on the  time necessary for the propagation of sound, has been generally adopted  by philosophers. This also accounts in the most rational manner for  the reverberation of thunder. As for the changes of intensity so fre-  quently mentioned, HelvigÂ§ regards the zigzags of the flash of light-  ning as playing a very important part in this phenomenon. He founds  his opinion on an observation in which he saw a flash of lightning  Avhich, in descending towards the earth made four bends, and pro-  duced as many distinct and well defined explosions, but not all of  the same force. According to him a change in the direction of a  flash of lightning must occasion a change in the sound of the thunder.  And in fact, as M. Arago|| also observes, v/hen a flash of lightning  that is proceeding directly from an observer doubles upon itself for  a moment, it is evidently a necessary result that there will be an  increase of the noise. Farther, this increase v/ill in its turn be fol-  lowed by a sudden decrease, if by a second bend the flash is brought  again to move a little nearer to the visual line, and so on. The changes   ^ Annuaire pour 1S38, page 451.  t Anaalcs da Cliiiuie et de Ph)-sique, tomeXS, pajcc 210. 1822.  :]: The Pobthunious Works of Kobcrt Hooke, page 42i, Lon.lon, 1705.  y Anualts de Gilbert, tome LI, page 13'J.

Kaemtz,*  from the fact that the compression of air must naturally be stronger  towards the apex of the angles where the inflexions of the flash of  lightning take place. There would then be, according to these phi-  losophers, a close connexion between the claps of thunder and the zig-  zags of the streaks of lightning, which it would be important to con-  firm by direct observation.   CHAPTEE III   OF THE PRINCIPAL EFFECTS PRODUCED BY LIGHTNING AT THE SURFACE OF  THE EARTH.  After having followed the lightning in its course through the air  and discussed the phenomena which it presents, it only remains for  us succinctly to state the principal effects which mark its passage to  the surface of the earth.  Definite observations show us that lightning follows the best con-  ductors of electricity which it meets in its passage ; that it turns oif  from its original course to strike metallic masses behind large piles  of masonry or even inside of them , when a conductor is wanting or does  not ofier a passage for its sufficient escape. Though harmless as long  as it passes through a metallic rod of sufficient size, we observe it  issuing from the extremity of the metal by breaking, pulverizing, or  throwing off the substances which oppose its course.  As in the case of the discharge of an electric battery, the lightning  in its passage considerably raises the temperature of the conducting  bodies, and frequently melts or volatilizes them. It is not unim-  portant to know what is the greatest thickness of different metals which  lightning has been known to fuse, and to assign to this phenomenon the  limits that have been observed. M. Arago,t in his notices on thunder,  directed his attention to this question, and from tlie sura of the obser-  vations he was able to collect, deduced the following conclusions:  that a flash of lightning could melt completely and through its  whole length a chain of iron 130 fetet long, of which the diameter of  the different links was not above a tourth of an inch; that it might effect  the fusion of a conical bar of copper 9 feet long and one-third of an  inch diameter at the base ; that it could also melt a leaden pipe of 3  inches in diameter and half an inch thick ; and, finally, that lightning  has never yet brought to red heat a bar of iron of half an inch in  'diameter.  When lightning traverses conducting wires and the heat which it  sets free is not enough to fuse the metal it shortens them. This singular  phenomenon was brought to view by the observation of an English  * Lebrbuch der Meteorologie, tome II, page 434.  f Annnaiie pour 1838, p. 305, &c.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 369  experimenter, Nairne,* in which the lightning, after having passed  through a tube for conducting rain water, followed a metallic wire,  by the aid of which a person could, without going out of his bed,  open and shut a gate ; after the passage of the lightning it was dis-  covered that this wire was shortened several inches. It is to be  observed that the common electric discharge produces the same elFecfe  as that mentioned by Nairne, which has been proved by M. Edmund  Becquerel.f The latter attributes this phenomenon to the expansive  force of the electric spark.  Another effect of lightning, not less remarkable, is the magnetic  polarity which it communicates to iron and steel. The packet ship  New York, in May, 1827, exhibited a striking example of this  effect. When this ship reached Liverpool, after having been twice  struck with lightning, Mr. Scoresby| discovered that the nails of the  partitions and broken panels, the iron work of the masts, the knives  and forks, even the points of the mathematical instruments, had ac-  quired a very decided magnetic power. It has also been observed that  when the lightning passed near the needle of the compass it changes  its magnetism, sometimes entirely destroys it, or reverses the poles.  These eftects, which are common to lightning and to ordinary electri-  city, and of which the consequences may be very serious, are not rare ;  the annals of science furnish a great number of examples.  Lightning, in condensing the particles of imperfect conductors of  electricity, sets free sufficient heat to kindle light substances, such as  straw, hay, cotton, &c. In forcing its way through sand to reach a  sheet of water at a certain distance below the surface of the ground,  it instantly fuses together the particles, and gives them the form of  vitrified cylinders, called fulminating tubes. These tubes, which  are sometimes 30 feet long, 2 inches in outer diameter and a few  lines in the inner diameter, are often divided into fragments by long  transverse fissures and terminated at their lower extremity by several  branches resembling roots. Their inside walls consist of glass uni-  formly brilliant and pure, while their covering is formed of a crust or  grains of agglutinated sand, the color of wjiich varies with the nature  of the strata through which the lightning passed. There can remain no  doubt as to the oiigin of these tubes, especially after the experiments ef  Messrs. Savart, Hachette, and Beudant Â§ These experimenters obtained  tubes of 25 millimetres long with a millimetre of inside diameter, by  causing the discharge of a very strong battery to pass through glass  reduced to powder. Effects of fusion similar to tlie fulminating tubes  have been observed on the peaks of high mountains ; where the surfaces  of the rocks present balls and vitreous strata, which alike attest the  passage of lightning. ||  Lightning produces mechanical effects of an astonishing intensity.  Thus when it bursts into a room it almost always displaces or over-  throws the furniture and utensils ; tears pieces of metal from   ^Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LXXII, Part I, p. 357. 1782.  tBibliothtMiuo Universelle, noiivclle series, torn.

These mechanical effects have been  differently accounted for by physicists. M. Pouillet* thinks that  they cannot be explained by the ordinary laws of electric attrac-  tions ; but that they depend on a difterence in the decomposition of  the natural electricities of bodies, according as this takes place by  slow or by sudden action. In the first case the conductibility is suffi-  cient for allowing the displacement of the electric fluids, and they have  time to arrange themselves at the surface, where they exercise against  the air a pressure which is capable of retaining the body in posi-  tion. In the second case, all the atoms of the mass undergo simul  taneously and suddenly a decomposition of their natural electricities ;  they are acted upon with so much violence that the arrangement  required by the laws of equilibrium has not time to be perfected, and  the masses are thus acted upon by forces incomparably greater than  those which tend to retain them in tlieir position.  M. Aragof has given to these phenomena of transportation pro-  duced by the lightning an entirely different explanation. He admits  that the lightning in its passage through bodies which contain water  developes steam, the expansive force of which is exerted in every direc-  tion ; so that, if we conceive of moisture being in the pores or cells of  a free-stone which the lightning strikes, the sudden development of  the vapor will break it, and its fragments will be projected to a dis-  tance in every direction. Under the same circumstances the rapid  transformation into vapor of water mixed with the stratum of the  ground on which the foundations of a house rests will be sufficient,  according to M. Arago, to raise up the building in a single mass and  transport it to a distance. This philosopher refers, to the same cause,  the singular dividing into splinters which wood undergoes when  lightning passes through it. It divides it lengthwise into a multi-  tude of slender laths or very fine splinters, and in green Avood  separates the bark from the trunk; the wood, leaves, and bark are oftea  completely scorched, in consequence of the dispersion of the water,  without presenting any trace of combustion.  It is probable that the expansive force of the vapor produced by the  passage of the electricity through wood may be the cause of the phe-  nomena which is presented when lightning strikes it, since water  which has only reached the temperature of 260Â° possesses an elastic  force of 45 atmospheres ; and since the heat developed by lightning in  j)assing through metallic wires is sufficient to melt them, it must  raise the temperature of the small quantities of water which it meets  in its passage to a high degree. | But if the ingenious explanation of  * Ele'mons de Phyfiique Expcrimentule et de Meteorologie, torn. I, p. 613.  t Annuaire pour 1838, page â– !(13.  'I la advancing tlie same opinion, M. Beoiuerel thought that we might explain thcse-  phenomena by supposing that the electric discharge meets less resistance in running  through the woody ti'orcs in the direction of lengtli than across thein ; this, according  to him, shows an expansive action, and, consequent!)', a tendency to cleave in the form of  laths. Traite de I'Electricite et du Magnctisme, torn. VI, Itre partie, page 107.   ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 371  M. Arago is applied without difficulty to the effects which lightning  produces in wood, it does not appear to be the same when we seek  to give account of the transfers effected by the lightning. It is diffi-  cult to conceive how the sudden vaporization of a small quantity of  water placed in the fissures of the body is capable of detaching the  fragments of a weight of more than two hundred pounds and to send  them fortli to a distance of nearly two hundred feet, as observation has  often proved. It is also by having recourse, as M. Pouillet has done,  to electrical attractions that M. Peltier\"^' explains tliis last phenomenon.  It is known that this philosopher regards a thunder-cloud as having  two distinct electrical tensions : the tension of free electricity at the  surface, and that of electricity retained at the surface of each of the  vesicles of vapor. This latter electricity not being able to participate  in the igneous discharge produced by the former, since it never  leaves the inside of the cloud, continues to act by its tension on terres-  trial bodies, and maintain them, in a free state of contrary electricity.  It is this powerful tension of attraction which, after the igneous dis-  charge caused by the nuturalization of free electricity, produces, ac-  cording to M. Peltier, the raising and transportation of the heavy  objects vv^ith which the strokes of lightning are very frequently at-  tended.  [The simple explanation of the phenomena is that the air in the  path of the discharge is instantaneously endowed with an intense re-  pulsive energy, which causes it to expand with explosive violence, and  thus produce the observed mechanical effects. J. li.]  Our object being to state only the principal effects of lightning we  shall add but a few words on the disastrous effects which are produced  when the discharge strikes men and animals. Observation teaches  that it kills them, either by producing lesions in the organs and in  the vascular system, or by paralyzing the nervous system ; they tlien  quickly undergo putrefaction, as is the case with all bodies sufier-  ing a violent death. But it sometimes happens that individuals are  struck with lightning without being killed, while other persons are  known to be killed by liglitning without being directly struck. The  former fact is to be explained by the consideration that organic bodies  being partial conductors, the electric matter may glide over their  surface without entering their interior ; while the latter is referred to  the effect known by the name of the return stroke, the result of  a violent action wliich takes place in the ponderable elements of  bodies, by the sudden recombination of their natural electricities decom-  posed by the electric induction of the thunder-cloud. Finally, it is  sometimes the case that lightning sets fire to light clothing on an  individual without causing any sensation of burning. This phe-  phenomenon is explained by the property which the electric fluid has  of setting fire to all fine substances which enter easily into combus-  tion, and of rarely kindling solid substances.   -' Observations efc Piocherclics expeiiinentalos siirles Causes qui concourcnt ;i la formation  des trombes, page 94; and Coinptos llcndus, torn.

Daniel's researches on electrolysis. â€” It may be considered as  well established that the chemical decomposition produced by the gal-  vanic current is always proportional to the force of the current, and  yet a more accurate examination of the electrolysis of different bodies  has disclosed phenomena which cannot satisfactorily be made to accord  with this law. If the current passes at the same time through a tan-  fgent compass, and through a voltameter, the quantity of detonating  gas evolved is always proportional to the tangent of the angle of de-  flection, whether the fluid in the voltameter be diluted sulphuric acid,  or a solution of phosphoric acid or of sulphate of soda. Casselman  has proved this by a series of accurate experiments in the treatise  already mentioned several times.  This seems, at the first glance, to agree completely with the law of  constant electrolytic action ; but the solution of salt was also decom-  posed, the acid accumulated at the positive, and the base at the nega-  tive pole, and consequently, in addition to the decomposition of water  corresponding to the force of current, a part of the salt was also  acted upon.  Daniell was the first one who accurately observed and investigated  this phenomenon. â€” (Philos. Transact., 1839, part I, page 9*7 ; 1840,  part I, page 209 ; Pog. An., 1842, sup. vol. p. 565 and p. 580.)   KECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   373    In the circuit of a battery of thirty constant zinc-copper elements  a decomposing cell of the following construction was inserted. A  strong glass cylinder of ahout 14 inches cubic content and closed at  both ends, was cut lengthwise and a porous ^.^ ^^g  clay plate inserted between the two halves ; the  whole was then connected again by means of  brass rings with clamp screws. In each of  the two cells thus formed 'a platinum electrode  2|- inches long and 1 inch wide was fastened  to a wire passing through the bottom of the  vessel. A bent glass tube was ground to the  top of each cell for the purpose of conducting  off the evolved gas. A preliminary experi-  ment showed that after 24 hours only a very  minute quantity of distilled water passed from one cell into the other.  Figure 156 is a sketch of this apparatus.  The first experiment with this apparatus was the following : Both  cells were filled with a solution of sulphate of soda so that the  electrodes were just covered ; the apparatus was then kept in connexion  with the battery until the evolved gases amounted to 29 cubic inches,  (corrected for pressure and temperature 28.3 cubic inches.) There  were, therefore, 3.6 grains of water decomposed.  The solution at the negative pole was strongly alcaline ; it was  carefully drawn oft with a glass syphon, and saturated with sul-  phuric acid of known strength, and was thus found to contain 12  grains of free soda. The solution at the positive pole was acid, and  by saturating it with a solution of carbonate of soda 15.1 grains of  free sulphuric acid were found.  If, now, the atomic weight of oxygen be taken at 100, that of water  will be 112.5, that of sulphuric acid 500, and that of soda 390.  Hence result the follov/ing proportions :  112.5 : 390 = 3.6 : 12.5  and 112.5 : 500 = 3.6 : 16  For one equivalent of the water decomposed, therefore, in one of  the cells, nearly one equivalent of sulphuric acid has been separated,  and in the other nearly one equivalent of soda.  Several experiments with other salts gave the same result. But  this experiment furnishes no datum for determining the relation of  the chemical decomposition to the force of current. This relation  would have been simply and precisely ascertained if, in addition to  the decomposing cell, a tangent compass had been inserted in the  circuit. It is to be regretted that this instrument appears to be so  little known in England, or at least very little use is made of it.  Daniell inserted into the circuit, instead of it, a voltameter filled with  dilute sulphuric acid, and found equal quantities of detonating gas  evolved in the voltameter and in the cell with sulphate of soda ; but  it appeared that, besides the decomposition of water, still another  effect had taken place in the voltameter, for the acid had accumulated  at the positive pole. For this reason Daniell examined more accu-  rately the decomposition of dilute sulphuric acid in a decomposing   374 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS,  cell with a porous diapliragm, and found, after the evolution of a  certain quantity of gas representing one equivalent of water, on the  side of the positive pole about one-fourth an equivalent of sulphuric  acid more, and on that of tlie negative pole one-fourth an equivalent  less than before the experiment. In this case, therefore, besides the  decomposition of water, a separation of water from sulphuric acid had  taken place analogous to the decomposition of the salt, though only  to the amount of one-fourth an equivalent.  This transmission of sulphuric acid to the amount of nearly one-  fourth an equivalent of the deconaposed water was independent of the  degree of concentration of the acid. Daniell modified the experiment  in various ways, but always obtained the same result.  A voltameter filled with sulphuric acid, therefore, is not applicable  for measuring the force of current passing through the solution of  sulphate of soda.  Besides the double cell with the solution of the salt, Daniell then  introduced, in addition, fused chloride of lead in the circuit of  the battery. It was placed in a bent tube of (green) glass, free from  lead, above a spirit lamp ; a platinum wire in the fused chloride of  lead served as the negative pole, while the positive was formed of  plumbago. At the latter chlorine gas was evolved ; upon the former  the reduced lead was deposited.  Here the following remarkable result was obtained : For one equiva-  lent of chloride of lead decomposed, in the other cell one equivalent  of water, and in addition to this one equivalent of salt were decom-  l)osed. According to the usual acceptation, therefore, it would appear  that in the cell with the solution of salt there was a chemical action  twice as great as that produced by the same current in the cell with  the chloride of lead ; this is in direct contradiction to the law of con-  stant electrolytic action.  In order to avoid this contradiction, Daniell considers the consti-  tution of salts from a quite novel point of view. He considers, for  instance, the sulphate of soda not as immediately formed by the com-  bination of acid and base, but assumes the electro-negative constituent  of the salt to be one equivalent of sulphur with four equivalents of  oxygen, while the positive is only sodium.  According to this view, therefore,  Sulphate of soda is not SO,. Na.O, but SO^. Na.  Sulphate of potassa is not SO3. KO, but SO^. K.  Nitrate of potassa is not NO5. KO, but NOg. K.  Phosphate of soda is not P0|. Na.O, but POy. Na.  Sulphate of copper is not SO3. Cu.O, but SO4. Cu.  If the current pass through the solution of such a salt it is not the  water but the salt which is decomposed into the constituents just  named. In the electrolysis of the sulphate of soda, therefore, SO4 is  produced at the positive pole as a direct etfect of the electrolysis, from  which (by a secondary action) is immediately set free, leaving SO3 ;  while at the other pole the Na. separated takes oxygen from the water,  and in this way liberates for each equivalent of Na. an equivalent of   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS, 375  hydrogen ; wliile the Na 0, i~iroduced by secondary action, remains in.  the solution.  The electrolysis of sulphate of copper proceeds in the same manner;  with this difference only, that the copper, reduced at the negative  pole, is not immediately oxydized again, and therefore evolves no  hydrogen, hut is deposited at the negative pole in the metallic con-  dition,  Daniell also proposes a new nomenclature corresponding to this  theoretical view of the constitution of the inorganic salts. He desig-  nates, for instance, the combination SO^ as oxysuJpMon, NO5 as  oxynitrion, &c.  According to this view, sulphate of copper is equal to oxysulphion  of copper ; nitrate of potassa is equal to oxynitrion of potassium, &c.  The experiments with a saturated solution of sal ammoniac perfectly  agree with the supposition that sal ammoniac is chloride of ammo-  nium, viz: that it is composed of the simple anion, (the negative con-  stituent,) CI., (chlorine,) and the compound kathion, (the positive  constituent,) NH^, (ammonium.) The positive pole, made of tin,  â€¢was dissolved ; while at the negative hydrogen and ammonia were  liberated, proceeding from the decomposition of NH^ into ISTHg and  H. Sulphate of ammonia is, accordingly, oxysulphion of ammonium,  SO,. NH,._  These views also lead to the generalization of the theory of hydrogen  acids, which has been repeatedly discussed by chemists, according to  which the oxygen acids, containing water, are like the hydrogen acids,  binary compounds of hydrogen, with a radical ; thus, sulphuric acid  would be SO4. H.  Between hydrate of sulphuric acid SO,. H and sulphate of soda  S04.Na, therefore, the same relation would exist as between muriatic  acid Cl.H and table salt Cl.Na ; the H being only replaced by Na.  But the above mentioned experiments on the electrolysis of dilute  sulphuric acid do not fully agree with this view.  If the hydrate of sulphuric acid really is oxysulphion of hydrogen,  then it must by electrolysis be decomposed into H and SO, ; but the  oxysulphion, liberated at the positive pole, is immediately decomposed  into SO3 and 0, the latter escaping as gas, while SO3 remains in the  fluid ; therefore for each equivalent of hydrogen liberated at the nega-  tive electrode, and for each equivalent of oxygen at the positive, an  equivalent of sulphuric acid SO., ought to appear at the positive pole ;  but, according to the above quoted experiments, after electrolysis only  :^- equivalent SO3 more is to be found in the positive cell than had  been there before.  The experiment was modified in various ways, but always with the  same result. Phosphoric acid behaved in like manner.  By electrolysis the quantity of phosphoric acid in the positive cell  was only augmented by \\ equivalent. A similar ex])eriment, made  with a solution of caustic potassa, showed that while 1 equivalent of  water was decomposed, somewhat less than y equivalent of potassa was  transferred to the negative pole.  Baryta water gave results similar to those obtained with caustic  j)otassa.   376   EECENT PROGRESS IN PUYSICS.   It would have been a great support for Daniell's view if lie had  succeeded in isolating the hypothetical oxysulphion SO^. In order to  attain this, if possible, he experimented with dilute sulphuric and  phosphoric acids, and with a solution of sulphate of soda in an  U shaped decomposing cell, provided with a diaphragm below, the  leg containing the positive pole being cooled down to oÂ°F, in order,  by this low temperature, to prevent the decomposition of SO^. But  these experiments did not give the desired result.  Daniell then experimented with solutions of acid salts. He pre-  pared a solution of hi-sulphate of potassa. After electrolysis it was  found that for each equivalent of hydrogen evolved at the negative  pole one equivalent of oxygen had escaped at the positive pole, but  that the cell at the negative pole contained only y equivalent of  potassa, and that at the positive pole I equivalent of sulphuric acid  more than before, or, in other words, that for one equivalent of water  decomposed -} equivalent of potassa had been transferred to the nega-  tive, and ^ equivalent of sulphuric acid to the positive pole.  This result appears, at the first glance, very complicated, but  Daniell succeeded in suggesting a simple explanation. Let us assume  that the fluid consists of 3 electrolytes, water, neutral sulphate of  potassa, and hydrate of sulphuric acid, or, according to Daniell's  designation, OH, SO4K and SO^H. If, now, the current is so divided  that one-half is conducted through HO, one-fourth through SOJ<^,  and one-fourth through SO4H, the direct results of the decomposition  will be :   At the positive pole-  l equiv. 0,  I equiv. SO^,  ^ equiv. SO4,   From OH   From SO4K   From SO.H   At the negative pole.  ^ equiv. H,  â– |- equiv. K,  l' equiv. H.   By the secondary effect the one-fourth equivalent of K takes up ^  equivalent to form \\ equivalent KO, and thereby {- equivalent of  H is liberated ; but at the other side SO4 separates into SO3 and O,  and thus we have :   At the positive pole â€”  ^ equiv. 0,  \\- equiv, SO3 -|- i equiv. 0,  ^ equiv. SO3 -j- |- equiv. 0,  h equiv. SO3 -\\- 1 equiv. 0,   At the negative pole â€”  ^ equiv. H,  I equiv. KO -f- ^ equiv. H,  ^ equiv. H,  I equiv. KO + 1 equiv. H,   which, in fact, perfectly agrees with the results of the experiment.  This, also, gave the key to the explanation of the decomposition of  diluted sulphuric acid; it is a compound electrolyte, consisting of  water and hydrate of sulphuric acid. The current is so divided that   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 377  I of it is conducted by the water, and I by the hydrate of sulphuric  acid, and thus we obtain :  At the positive pole â€” At the negative pole â€”  f equiv. 0, f equiv. H,  ^ equiv. SO^, I equiv. H,  and by the decomposition of SO^ :  At the positive pole â€” At the negative pole â€”  f equiv. 0, f equiv. H,  I equiv. SO3 + {- equiv. 0, ^ equiv. H,   I equiv. SO, -{- 1 equiv. 0, . ' 1 equiv. H,  exactly as demonstrated by the experiment.  In support of his view of the electrolysis of acid salts Daniell also  mentions the fact, that from a neutral solution of sulphate of copper  the metal is deposited in a compact mass at the negative pole, and  firmly adheres to it ; while the copper is deposited in a more pulveru-  lent state when reduced from a strongly acid solution.  In the neutral solution only SOjCu. is decomposed, and therefore  only Cu. deposited at the platinode; while in an acid solution HO and  SO4H are also electrolized, and, therefore, besides Cu., H is also libe-  rated at the negative pole.  Daniell also relates some additional observations on the electrolysis  of secondary combinations. He examined carbonate ofpotassa, of soda,  and of ammonia, and found that the carbonic acid and oxygen, both  given off as gas at the positive pole, were equivalent to the alkali and  hydrogen at the negative pole. He considers, therefore, the carbo-  nates as oxycarbonions of potassium, sodium, ammonium, &c.  Note. â€” [Daniell' s theory of the constitution of salts, although  affording, as far as it goes, a simple explanation of the phenomena  of electrolysis, is not adopted by chemists at the present time. The  theory now becoming general is one which, while it is perfectly in  accordance with the whole range of chemical facts, explains, as well  as that of Daniell's, everything relating to electrolysis, but is sus-  ceptible of far greater extension. In this view salts are considered  not as made up of two pre-existing substances, but as a ivhole, a form  or type dependent upon laws of nature which we can yet but partly  determine. The general expression for a salt will then be E. M., or,  rather, R. Mn., in which M. represents a metal, or hydrogen, (a metal,)  which may be replaced by any other metal. li, in this case, repre-  sents that element, or those elements, which combine with a metal or  metals so replaceable. This view is only an extension of that of Davy,  which, by a splendid generalization, includes the so-called haloid  salts â€” the chlorides, iodides, &c. â€” under a common head with the  salts of, what are called, oxygen acids. A departure from this view  at one time led to the separation of common salt (chloride of sodium)  from the very family to which it gave name, and involved an intricate  and circuitous explanation of phenomena which were evidently iden-  tical.  But the theory of the constitution of salts to which we refer not   378 EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  only embraces Davy's views, but goes still farther. It not only in-  cludes, under a common expression, tlie salts and the acids, but also  the oxides. In this relation it must be distinctly understood that,  while the type exists as a whole, and the replaceable metal is also  that which, as an element, may be separated from tlie type, it is by  no means necessary that the remaining elements should be, together,  capable of a separate existence. Before carrying out this theory in  its application to the phenomena of electrolysis, we should, as a bare  act of justice, state that it is mainly due to the labors of Laurent and  Gerhardt, chemists, who have gained the noble but uncoveted distinc-  tion that they have attained their greatest reputation when they  have â€” died.  It is also not a little remarkable that the views of these chemists  should now be quoted as supporting a correct idea of electrolysis,  when their chief labor was to overthrow the so-called electro-chemical  theory. It is quite possible that some other generalization may cause  both theories to coincide, (a clue to which has been furnished by these  chemists ;) but, meanwhile, it is highly instructive to learn that  where the nature and reaction of various elements are concerned true  chemical philosophy is able to assert and maintain its own dominion.  To proceed to details without entering into unnecessary refine-  ments, we shall show the electrolytic action upon the salt type, always  presupposing the indifference of either electrode to the substances  evolved, the metal (or the hydrogen) being eliminated at one pole and  the residue at the other, and no secondary eifect being produced. As  instances of the simplest case we have the following :  From 0. H., II. is removed, and 0., the residue, is given off at the other pole.  From CI. H., H. is removed, and C!., the residue, is given off p.t the other pole.  From CI. Cu., Cu. is removed, and CI., the residue, is given off at the other pole.  Of these water is the most stable compound, and is, therefore, de-  composed with the greatest difficulty.  But, carrying out this view, such compounds as CI. Cu.g, &c., are  still considered as belonging to the same type ; but the metal is  regarded as entering into combination with a new equivalent, which  is either a simple multiple or fraction of that which usually occurs.  This hypothesis, advanced without reference to electrolysis, is strik-  ingly corroborated by the experiments of Becquerel, noticed further on.  But if, with many chemists, we consider water to be Hj, the  ordinary oxides Mj, (and this is in accordance with the physical  properties of the elements,) we will have M H as a hydrated  oxide, which, in the case of K H, will be more readily decomposed  than water alone.  In the instances above given we have noticed only such cases of the  saline type, which, on the abstraction of the metallic element, leave a  residue, itself an element and capable of a separate existence. But  in the \" oxygen acids \" the residue is not capable of a separate exist-  ence and breaks up into such compounds, or compounds and elements,  as can exist. As representatives of this class we have S 0^ H, or  generally S O4 M, from which H or M being taken, the residue  cannot remain as such, but is given off and S O3 unites with water   EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 6l\\)  and remains in solution. Pure S O4 H (concentrated sulphuric acid)  does not afford the water, and the remaining S O3 is decomposed by a  secondary action.  We are thus able to represent equally well the increased facility of  decomposition of water, either by the addition of an acid or of an  alkali, (in the latter case secondary action may, however, take place,)  and this, too, from a purely chemical point of view, chosen without  reference to electrolytic action.  One further remark is required. In the salt type N 11, is capable  of takin -2; the place of a metal ; this is simply a statement of the fact,  but in electrolysis this substitution for the metallic element is with-  drawn instead of the metals but not being capable of an independent  existence, (under the circumstances, if at all,) it appears in the form  of hydrogen and ammonia N H3 + H. We do not pretend to follow  out the cases in which one or more of the equivalents of the hydrogen  of the N H, are replaced by some other elements which experience has  shown can be introduced instead of them. The mode of reasoning  and the consequences will be similar.  It will not be difficult, by carrying out the same theory of the com-  position of salts to explain the electrolysis of the phosphates and  arseniates, noticed in a subsequent part of this report.  Daniell's views, then, are correct, as far as they go, in showing the  manner in which salts are broken up in eleltrolysis, but they are in  error in considering that the two parts into which the salt is broken  are two distinct substances which are capable of independent existence.  Hence the failure of Daniell in his attempts to isolate his \" Oxysul-  phion,\" S 0^, a compound incapable of independent existence.  The difference between these two theories of the constitution of  salts, beyond the im})ortant fact that one is far more general than the  other, may by some be considered as trivial ; but this is not the case,  for at least one valuable result is obtained, that chemists are relieved  from the opprobrium of describing and descanting upon the important  properties of certain compounds which tliey cannot produce and which  the most intelligent among them do not deem capable of production  or of independent existence.  In commencing this note the intention was simply to announce that  the hypothesis of Daniell, as to the constitution of salts, was not in  accordance with the commonly received opinion of chemists of the  present day, and to follow out the latter, with reference to the phe-  nomena of electrolysis, to what were deemed their inevitable results.  But, upon examination, it does not appear that any formal announce-  ment of the concordance of the present views of chemists with the laws  of electrolysis has been made, though doubtless every intelligent man  has followed up this concordance, for it is inevitable. This reflects  greater credit upon those who have, in a more advanced state of the  science, announced correct purely chemical theories, and upon Davy,  who, at a much earlier period, gave the hint of, possibly, a far higher  generalization, while still much credit is due to Daniell for leading  back the scientific world to sounder views. â€” Gr. C. S.]  Â§ 172. Deposits upon diaphragms. â€” In the memoir just discussed  Daniell also describes some very interesting phenomena, the considera-    380 EECENT PEOGEESS IN PHYSICS.  tion of whicli, to avoid interruptions, we have deferred, viz : tlie  deposits upon the diaphragms and the accumulation of the fluid at the  negative pole,  Faraday had already found by placing the positive pole in a con-  Pig. 157. centrated solution of sulphate of magnesia  ^ ^ and the negative in water floating upon that  solution, (the experiment being most con-  veniently made in the manner indicated by  â– ^gure 157,) that by the passage of a very  powerful current magnesia was deposited  at the surface of contact of the two fluids. In  the water oxygen passes toward the + po^e  and in the solution of sulphate of magnesia  magnesium toward the â€” pole ; and when  they meet each other at the dividing surface of the two fluids they  combine to form magnesia, which is precipitated. Similar observa-  tions are noticed by Daniell, in the above mentioned memoir.  He filled a glass cylinder, closed at the bottom by means of a piece of  bladder, with a dilute solution of caustic potassa, and suspended it so  that it just dipped below the surface of a concentrated neutral solution  of sulphate of copper in a wider glass vessel. He then placed the  negative pole of a battery of twenty cells in the solution of potassa  and the positive in that of the sulphate of copper. At the negative  pole hydrogen was evolved, at the positive oxygen, while the bladder,  from which also some gas arose, was copiously coated v^^ith metallic  copper interspersed with oxide of copper and blue hydrated oxide.  This action is thus explained. The sulphate of copper is decomposed  into S O4 and Cu.; the ibrmer passes to the positive pole, the latter to the  bladder, where it is arrested, and gives up its charge to thQ hydrogen  of the other electrolyte, the solution of potassa, v/hich then passes on  to the negative pole and is evolved. On the other hand, the oxygen of  the solution of potassa on its way towards the positive pole is arrested  by the bladder, transfers its charge to the S O4 passing in the same  direction, and combines with the copper it meets at the bladder.  But this action is too rapid for this combination to be complete, a  part of the copper is precipitated in the metallic state upon the blad-  der, while a part of the oxygen escapes as gas.  In fact, the metallic copper diminishes in quantity as the force of  current decreases. With feebler currents the bladder was covered with  a thick coating of oxide of copper, in which only a few spangles of  metallic copper were visible.  From nitrate of silver much metallic silver was deposited upon the  membrane, mixed with oxide of silver. Gas, too, was disengaged  from the diaphragm. The whole of the oxygen was not evolved at  the positive pole, but a part of it combined by secondary action with  the oxide of silver in the solution to form a peroxide.  Mfra.te of lead gave similar results. Froto-nilraie of mercury  exhibited the most remarkable phenomenon. Not only were globules  of mercury formed upon the membrane, but a shower of small globules  fell from the diaphragm throughout the experiment.  Â§173. Accumulation of fluid at the negative 'pole. â€” Porret first ob-   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 381  served that fluids are transferred without any decomposition from one  electrode to the other. -^ â€” (Ann. of Philos., Jul., 1816; Fogg. Ann. XII.,  618.) He divided a glass vessel by a diaphragm of bladder into two  cells, filled them with water, and suspended in each a platinum plate  connected with the poles of a battery of 80 pairs. In this way nearly  the whole of the fluid was transferred to the negative cell. This eflect  did not take place when the conducting power of the water was  improved by the addition of sulphuric acid. Daniell used distilled  water in his decomposing cell. On connecting it with a battery of 30  cells, a few bubbles only appeared at the electrodes, but none was  disengaged, (in this case again the insertion of a tangent compass  would have been very desirable;) but after 40 minutes the fluid at the  negative pole was \\ inch higher than at the positive. When a little  freshly precipitated alumina was difi'used in the water at the positive  pole, a portion of this finely divided solid matter evidently passed  with the water to the negative pole. When the cell was filled with  a mixture of 8 jiarts of water and one of sulphuric acid, no change of  level took place. But nevertheless this phenomenon does not depend  upon the conducting power, for it frequently appears with saline solu-  tions, which conduct well, even in a higher degree than with pure  water.  When the cell with the porous diaphragm contained sulphate of  soda, the fluid in the negative cell rose H inch, while nine cubic  inches of oxygen were liberated there; with phosphate of soda the  difference in height was 2 inches. Nitrate of potasa produced this  transfer in a much less degree.  In order to ascertain whether in this process of transfer the entire  fluid was carried over or only the salt, or the water, Daniell examined  the specific gravity before and after the exj)eriment without finding  any perceptible difference.  Whatever may be the immediate cause of this phenomenon, it appears  to have some analogy with the translation of good conducting sub-  stances, which in the formation of the luminous Voltaic arc serve as  a continuous connexion between the two poles. Daniell believes that  this process has no relation to endosmosis.  Â§ 174. Eleclrolysis of polyhasic salts. â€” Daniell in connexion with Miller  extended his researches on electrolysis to still more complicated cases.  (Philos. Transact., f. 1844, pt. I; Pogg. Ann. LXIV, 18.) Of these  we shall now consider more in detail the electrolysis of the different  modifications of the phospliates. But to make these interesting phe-  nomena intelligible to those not familiar with the constitution of the  phosphates, I shall briefly explain the most important part of the  theory, referring i'or an exceedingly clear exposition of the subject to  Otto & Graham's Lehrhuch der Chemie, 2d edition, second volume, page  380.  The common phosphoric acid PO^ forms, with soda, three different  salts, viz:  3N,0,P0, 1.)  2N; OHO, PO5 2.)  N, 02HO, Po, 3.)  the second of which is the common officinal phosphate of soda; it was   382 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  formerly called the neutral, while the first was designated aÂ« the hasic,  and the last as the acid salt.  In No. 2, HO, and in No. 3, 2H0 are essential constituents of the  salt, HO takes tlie place of one equivalent of base, and thus in all  three cases one equivalent of acid is combined with three equivalents  of base.  If a solution of acetate of lead is added to that of No. 2, a precipi-  tate of phosphate of lead is produced, which also contains three equiva-  lents of base to one of acid, and therefore consists of 3 PCO, PO5.  A solution of nitrate of silver precipitates from a solution of No. 2  the tri-basic phosphate of silver 3 AgO, PO^, which is distinguished  by its yellow color.  This modification of phosphoric acid, which is characterized by  always saturating three equivalents of bases, is therefore called tribasic  phosphoric acid, and is also designated as c phosphoric acid. If three  equivalents of bases are replaced by three equivalents of water, this  combination gives the c hydrate, the ter-hydrate, or the tri-basic hy-  drate of phosphoric acid.  When the common phosphate of soda 2 N^OHO, PO5 is ignited its  nature is entirely changed. After being re- dissolved it gives crystals of  an entirely different salt, which was formerly denominated pyro-phos-  phate of soda. By ignition, the equivalent of basic water has been  expelled, and thereby a salt obtained which has only two equivalents  of soda for one equivalent of PO5, or is 2 Nâ€ž0, PO5.  On adding acetate of lead bi-basic phosphate of lead is precipita.ted  2 PCO, PO5, vv'hich, when decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, gives  the solution of the bi-basic or h phosphoric aci^.  Graham considers this dilute acid as the solution of the hydrate  2 HO, PO5, which he denominates deuto-hydrate of phosphoric acid.  When this acid is saturated with bases two equivalents of the base  always combine with one eq^^iivalent of acid. The h phosphate of soda  gives by the addition of nitrate of silver a white precipitate of h phos-  phate of silver, while the tri-basic silver salt has, as already men-  tioned, a yellow color.  By igniting the salt, formerly known by the name of acid phosphate  of soda, N^0.2H0, PO5, the two equivalents of water are expelled,  and the mono-basic phosphate or a phosphate of soda remains N^O,  PO5. By adding acetate of lead or nitrate of silver the corresponding  lead and silver salts are obtained PCO, PO5, and A^O, POr;. These  salts are distinguished by their gelatinous character.  The hydrate of the mono-basic, or a phosphoric acid, or the proto-  hydrate of phosphoric acid is also distinguished from the other hydrates  of the same acid by producing a white precipitate in a solution of  albumen.  The a and h hydrates of phosphoric acid are converted into common  phosphoric acid by heating their solutions.  We will now proceed to Daniell's and Miller's experiments on the  electrolysis of the phosphates. A strong solution of tri-basic phos-  phate of soda and water 2 N,^ OHO, PO^ was poured into the negative  side of the double cell, and a dilute solution of soda into the other.  On passing the current from a constant battery of 20 cups, oxygen was   RECENT PROGEESS IN PHYSICS. 383  evolved at the positive, hydrogen at the negative pole. The current  was interrupted alter 48 cubic inches of hydrogen had been obtained.  The fluid in the cell at the positive pole, carefully saturated with  nitrid acid, gave with nitrate of silver a copious yelloio precipitate, c  phosphoric acid had, therefore, evidently been carried to the positive  cell.  A like result was obtained, when instead of the salt 2 N^OHO, PO^  a solution of 3 N^O, PO5 was put into the negative cell ; in this case,  too, after the termination of the electrolysis tri-basic phosphoric acid  \"was found in the negative cells. But when, on the otlier hand, a  solution of the bi-basic phosphate of soda 2 N^O, PO., was used on the  side of the negative pole, after the termination of the electrolysis it  was found that b phosphoric acid had been transferred to the solution  of soda of the positive cell, for the fluid, when neutralized with nitric  acid, gave, on the addition of nitrate of silver, a white precipitate.  Finally, a solution of the mono-basic phosphate of soda N^O, PO5  was electrolized under the same circumstances, and the fluid of the  positive pole yielded with nitrate of silver, after the termination of  the electrolysis, a white gelatinous precipitate, thereby proving that  a j)hosphoric acid had been transferred to the positive cell.  Here we have the remarkable phenomenon that the same body PO5  with equal composition occurs in different modifications, conditions  usually ascribed to an allotropic state ; PO5 saturates, according to  circumstances, one or two or three equivalents of base. In the elec-  trolysis of phosphates the phosphoric acid always appears at the posi-  tive electrode in the same modification in which it was present in the  salt of the negative cell. From a tri-basic salt c phosphoric acid is  transferred to the positive electrode, from a bi-basic salt c phosphoric  acid, and from a mono-basic salt a phosphoric acid.  The view of the constitution of the salts to which Daniell was led  by his experiments on electrolysis, and which has been explained in  Â§ 171, is in perfect agreement with the electrolytic relations of the  phosphates when considered in connexion with the above described pe-  culiariiies of these salts.  According to this theory we must consider  3 Na 0, P O3 as Na.+P 0^â€ž Tritoxyphosphion of Sodium,  2 Na O, P O5 as Na2-}-P Oj, Deutoxyphosphion of Sodium,  Na 0, P 0^ as Na+P 0^, Protoxyphosphion of Sodium.  In the electrolysis of Tritoxyphosphion of Sodium, Na3 is liberated  at the negative pole, while P 63 passes to the positive. Q^ the oxy-  dati(m of the three e([uivalents of Na, three equivalents of H are  evolved at the negative pole, while at the other pole three equivalents  PI combine with P 0, to form H3-f-P 0^, that is the Ter- or Trito-hy-  drate, so that three equivalents of oxygen must necessarily escape at  the positive pole.  In the electrolysis of the Deutoxyphosphion of Sodium, P 0^ passes  to the positive pole and evolves two equivalents of oxygen, by com-  bining with H. to form Ho+P O7, that is Deutohydrate, while at the  other pole two equivalents of Sodium are formed and two equivalents  of hydrogen evolved.   384 EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  In the electrolysis of tlie monobasic salt, P Og goes to the positive  pole and forms the protohydrate H-}-P Og.  Â§ 175. Electrolysis of arsenites and sulphites. â€” The English physi-  cists next directed their attention to the electrolysis of salts whose  acids had a lower degree of oxygenation than those already examined.  The negative cell was charged with a solution of arsenite of potassa,  (K 0+As O3,) the positive with a solution of potassa. At the positive  pole oxygen was evolved, but no hydrogen appeared at the negative  pole, the electrode being covered with metallic arsenic. According to  Daniell's view, K was liberated in the negative cell by electrolysis,  and by its oxydation enabled the corresponding H to reduce the arse-  nious acid ; As O4 was transferred to the positive cell, one equivalent of  oxygen liberated and the remaining arsenious acid formed with the  potassa present arsenite of potassa.  Sulphite of potassa (K O+S O2) in both the cells gave hydrogen at  the negative, but no oxygen at the positive pole ; sulphuric acid was  produced in the positive cell, which by acting upon the sulphite evolved  some sulphurous acid, K was liberated by the current at one pole and  hydrogen evolved by its oxydation ; SO2+O, designated by Daniell  as Suboxysulphion, was transferred to the other and appeared there as  SO3.  Hyposuljjhite of Soda (Na O-j-Sa O., gave similar results. Hydrogen  was evolved at the negative pole, and no gas at the positive pole, but  a strong smell of sulphurous acid was perceived there, accompanied by  a gradual deposit of sulphur. 83 OsH\"^ passes to the positive pole, is  decomposed into S^SO^, and by the action of the sulphuric acid upon  the surrounding salt sulphurous acid is evolved.  Tlie experiments on the electrolysis of the yellow and red prussiate  of potash we cannot discuss in this place.  Â§ 176. IVans/er of the bases. â€” In the electrolysis of the phosphates  the acid was carried into the positive cell filled with a solution of Foda.  Daniell next endeavored, inversely, to transfer the bases of the i)Osi-  tive cell into the negative one filled with acid. With a solution of  sulphate of copper and potassa Cu 0. S O3+KO. S O3 only traces of  copper were carried to the negative cell and dej^osited at the negative  pole, but it was found that, compared with the gases evolved, ^ equiv.  of potassa had been transferred to the negative cell.  A solution of sidphate of aluvmia and potassa (alum, Alo O3, 3 S O3  -f-KO.SO.) gave similar results; potassa was transferred to llie  negative cell in the same proportion as in the previous experiment,  but no alumina.  From a solution of .ndphate of magnesia and potassa (Mg 0. S O3-I-  K 0. S O3) in like manner only potassa was carried over with a minute  quantity of magnesia.  Instead of the double-salts a series of solutions of sesquisidphate of  alumina (Alg O3. 3 S O3,) of sesquisulphate of iron (FCg O3 3. S O3) and  sidphate of copper (Cu O. S O3) were next introduced into the positive  cell and the negative charged with diluted sulphuric acid. Neither  alumina nor oxide of iron or copper passed in perceptible quantities  into the negative cell. Both the cells were then filled with a solution  of sulphate of copper. The metal precipitated at the negative pole,   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 385  the solution was deprived of copper ; one equivalent of sulphuric acid  had passed into the other cell, but the quantity of copper contained  in it remained unchanged ; no cop})er, therefore^ had been transferred  from the positive to the negative cell.  Sulphate of zinc acted in the same manner.  But these results are not to be attributed to the influence of the dia-  phragm. When a long syphon tube reversed was filled with a solu-  tion of sulphate of copper and at the ends tv/o strips of the same metal  were immersed as electrodes, the color of the fluid became lighter at  the negative and darker at the j^ositive pole.  '' By this it appears demonstrated,\" says Daniell, \" that the metals,  which are cajmble of decomposing water at ordinary temperatures, or  whose oxides are largely soluble in water, are susceptible of transfer-  ence in the Voltaic circuit from the zincode (positive) to the planti-  node (negative pole,) while those which are not marked by this strong  affinity for oxygen remain stationar}^\"  On impartially considering the circumstance that some bases, by the  electrolysis of the solutions of their salts, do not pass to the negative  pole, the idea occurs that, in this case, the salt is not directly electro-  lized, and does not conduct the current, but that its decomposition is  only a secondary phenomenon. When metallic copper is precipitated  fiom a solution of sulpliate of copper at the negative pole, while no  copper is coming from, but one equivalent of sulphuric acid is passing  to the positive pole, it can scarcely be otherwise explained than by  supposing that SO4H is directly electrolized ; H goes to the negative  pole and reduces one equivalent of copper there, SO^ to the positive and  evolves one equivalent 0, leaving one equivalent SO3 behind. This, it  is true, is not in agreement with Daniell's views as explained in Â§ 171,  which, however, apply to all those cases where the bases of the de-  composed salt also suffers a transfer, as, for instance, in the electrolysis  of KO -\\- SO3.  Â§177. Becquerel's researches on the laws of electro-chemical decomposi-  tion. â€” The younger Becquerel has also instituted interesting researches  on the laws of electrolysis, (An7i. de Chim. et de Phys. Ser. Ill, T. XI,  pp. 162 and 257 ; an abstract in Pogg. Ann. LXV, 401.) Faraday  had stated, as a principle, that of the different combinations which  may take place between two elements only those are decomposed by  the current which consist of an equal numlier of equivalents of either.  Matteucci had already demonstrated the probability that this prin-  ciple was not generally applicable, (Bibl. Univers. Ser. nouv., T. XXI,  p. 153,) and J3ecquerel has by numerous experiments removed all  remaining doubts upon the subject.  Becquerel first examined several chlorides of metals in the state of  fusion as well as in saturated aqueous solutions. In using the fused  chlorides the accuracy of the result was disturbed by the circumstance  that the chlorine evolved at the positive pole, becoming diffused  through the fluid, in part re-dissolved the metal precipitated at the  negative pole, tliereby making the quantity obtained always too small.  For this reason Becquerel mostly employed the metallic chlorides  dissolved in suitable fluids, after having satisfied himself that as much  metal is precipitated from the solutions as from the fused chlorides,  25   386   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS-   and also fhat in these solutions the chloride of the metal only is electro^  lized and not the water, for chlorine was always evolved at the posi-  tive pole and not oxygen, as would have been the case if the water,  even in part only, had been electrolized.  The solution to be examined was contained in two vessels connected  by a syphon, each of which received an electrode. The negative  electrode was usually of platinum, while for the positive electrode  either this or other metals were used.  If the solution was liable to be decomposed by the air it was covered  with a bell-glass, which could either be exhausted or filled with an  indifferent gas.  Besides this decomposition apparatus a voltameter was inserted into  the circuit; the battery usually consisted of 30 feebly charged elements.  The following table gives the results of a series of experiments :    Dissolved in   Water decom-  posed.   PRECIPITATED METAL.    Computed.   Found.

In the first three cases 1 equivalent of metal, in fact, was precipi-  tated at the negative pole of the decomposing apparatus for 1 equiva-  lent of water decomposed in the voltameter ; but in all these cases  the electrolized chlorides consisted of 1 equivalent of metal and one  of chlorine.  The chloride of copper contains 2 equivalents of metal to one of  chlorine, and in this case for one equivalent of water decomposed in  the voltameter 2 equivalents of copper were precipitated in the decom-  posing apparatus.  From the chloride of antimony only -| equivalent of antimony were  obtained, and, in fact, it is a combination of only f equivalent of metal  for 1 equivalent of chlorine.  By computing the quantity of chlorine carried to the positive pole  of the decomposing apparatus, it appears that for each equivalent of  water decomposed there was one equivalent of chlorine evolved.  This law was also confirmed by another series of experiments, in   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 387  which the precipitated metal was not determined, but the amount of  evolved chlorine ascertained by the loss of weight of the electrode,  which was of copper. In this manner experiments were made â€”  With chloride of copper Cu. CI.  chloride of iron Fco CI3.  chloride of tin Sn CI2.  chloride of antimony Sbg CI5.  The chlorine computed as equivalent with the water agreed in all  these cases with that observed, though only one of the combinations,  viz, Cu CI, has equal constituents of the constituent parts.  Iodides and Bromides gave similar results.  Becquerel also instituted experiments with oxides. H^ dissolved  sub-oxide Cu^ and oxide of copper Cu 0, each separately, in liquid  ammonia, and closed the flask air-tight by means of a cork, through  which the wires of the electrodes passed. Simultaneously with either  of these solutions a solution of nitrate of copper, serving as a volta-  meter, was inserted into the circuit of a single constant zinc-copper ele-  ment. These experiments, each of which was continued for several  hours_, demonstrated that for 1 equivalent of copper, precipitated at  the negative pole of the voltameter, charged with nitrate of copper,  there were deposited â€”  2 equivalents of copper from the solution of Cuj 0.  1 equivalent of copper from the solution of Cu 0.  The last binary combination examined by Becquerel was oxygenated  water H O2. For every equivalent of water decomposed in the in-  serted voltameter two equivalents of oxygen were liberated from the  oxygenated water at the positive pole.  The researches on the electrolysis of solutions of different salts lead  to results similar to those which we have seen were obtained by Daniell.  Faraday's proposition, therefore, that binary combinations are only  electrolytes when they are composed of equal equivalents of both con-  stituent parts proves to be untenable, since many bodies can directly  be decomposed by the current which do not fulfil this condition.  In reference to the quantity of decomposition, the result of Becque-  rel's researches may be best expressed in the words of Poggendorff :  that with an equal force of current for every equivalent of water there  is also an equivalent of any combination decomposed, provided that  it can be decomposed at all.  Â§ 178. Formation of cldoride of nitrogen hy electrolysis. â€” When a  saturated solution of sal ammoniac, between platinum electrodes, is  exposed to the galvanic current hydrogen is evolved at the negative  pole, but no chlorine at the positive, and, if the solution is sufficiently  concentrated, no oxygen either, but the positive platinum plate be-  comes covered with small, yellowish, oily drops of chloride of nitrogen.  When spirit of turpentine is poured upon the solution, the rising  drops detonate as soon as they come in contact with tlie turpentine.  It is better to place the ])ositive pole not vertically but in an inclined  position in the fluid. This interesting phenomenon was discovered  nearly at the same time, without the knowledge of each other, by   388 EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  Kolbe, then sojourning in England, and by Bottger, in Francfort.  Kolbe describes the formation of chloride of nitrogen by the electro-  lysis of a saturated solution of sal ammoniac in Phil. Mag. XXX, p,  336. Bottgen has, as far as I know, never published anything on this  subject, but showed the experiment in the laboratory at Giessen.  The formation of the chloride of nitrogfen is evidently a secondary  effect. If we consider the sal ammoniac as chloride of ammonium H^  IS\" CI, then, by the decomposition, CI. goes to the positive and H^ N  to the negative pole. From H^ N one equivalent of hydrogen is evolved  which escapes, leaving Hg N, while the nascent chlorine at the posi-  tive pole decomposes the chloride of ammonium, producing chloride  of nitrogen and muriatic acid. When to chloride of ammonium H^  N CI 6 equivalents of chlorine are added, 6 CI, 4 H Cl^ (4 equivalents  of muriatic acid,) and N CI3 chloride of nitrogen are produced.  Â§ 179. Oxijdizing ejects of the oxygen evolved at the positive pole of  the battery. â€” The oxygen evolved by the galvanic current at the posi-  tive pole has, in its nascent state, strong oxydizing properties, so that  it forms combinations into which the free oxygen, under other circum-  stances, would not directly enter. Kolbe has instituted interesting  and important experiments on this subject.  A saturated aqueous solution of chloride of potassium is decomposed  between platinum electrodes, by the current from a battery of four  Bunsen's cups, in such manner that at first chlorine is evolved at the  positive, hydrogen at the negative pole, and free potassa formed, which  gives the fluid an alcaline reaction. In proportion as, by the progress-  ing decomposition, the fluid is deprived of chloride of potassium the  electrolysis acts also upon the water, liberating at the positive pole, be-  sides the chlorine, also oxygen, which partly escapes, and partly com-  bines chemically with the chlorine, forming at first hypo-chlorous acid,  (CI. 0,) and then chloric acid, (CI. O5,) which are found in alcaline  solution in combination with the potassa.  The formation of chlorate of potassa must certainly, under these  circumstances, be considered as the result of the action of the chlorine  upon the free potassa. But the same process of decomposition also  takes place if to the solution of the chloride of potassium even more  sulphuric acid is added than corresponds to the equivalent of the  potassium, so that no free alkali can occur, with the single difference  that in this case hyperchlorate of potassa (KO CI 0;) is formed,  which usually crystalizes when the fluid, which becomes hot, has  cooled again.  Finally, also, from pure muriatic acid, especially when a few drops  of sulphuric acid are added, a mixture of free chloric and hyperchloric  acid is obtained; while, at the same time, free chlorine escapes at the  -f- pole and hydrogen at the â€” pole. Hence it appears that chlorine  and oxygen, in the nascent state, combine directly, without the pres-  ence of any free alkali, while heretofore the so-called predisposing  affinity was considered an essential condition to this combination, (as  on passing chlorine through a solution of caustic potassa.)  A solution of cyanide of potassium is easily oxydized under similar  conditions, and cyanate of potassa (KO. Cy 0) is formed. Kolbe  could not obtain a higher oxygen compound of cyanogen, corresponding   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 389  to the chloric or hyperchloric acid, by the long continued electrolysis  of cyan ate of potassa; neither did a solution of fluoride of potassium  yield an oxygen compound of fluorine.  Kolbe also succeeded in obtaining products of oxydation from  sesquichloro-carbohypo-sulphuric acid, HO -\\- C^ ^h ^2 O5) ^7 nieans of  the current, (Liebig's Ann., vol. 54, p. 157 ; Philos. Magaz., XXX,  334,) while this acid, under other circumstances, resists the most  powerful oxydizing agents, so that it may be boiled with chromic or  nitric acid, &c., without undergoing any change.  When a concentrated solution of sesquichloro-carbohypo-sulphate of  potassa is exposed between platinum electrodes to the current from a  battery of 4 Bunsen's cups, at first no hydrogen is evolved at the  negative pole, while chlorine, carbonic acid, and, afterwards, oxygen,  are evolved at the positive pole.  As soon as the decomposition commences, an acid reaction of the  solution is perceptible, owing to the formation of free muriatic and  sulphuric acids. In a later stage of the process, these acids increasing  in quantity, hydrogen appears at the negative pole_, until, finally,  after all the muriatic acid has been decomposed, and the evolution of  chlorine has ceased, small octahedral crystals of per-chlorate of potassa  are deposited from the solution, which now contains free sulphuric  acid and bi-sulphate of potassa.  These results may be explained in the following manner : The  oxygen, liberated at the positive pole in consequence of the decompo-  sition of water, acts upon the acid, and causes its separation into  difterent compounds. Tbe oxydation of the acid is complete when it  has taken up 12 equivalents of oxygen; the decomposition may then be  represented as follows :   f KO + CIO7  KO -f C2CI3S2O ' 2SO3  12 6 J 2 CO,  [2 cr   There are formed, therefore, per-chlorate of potassa^ sulphuric and  carbonic acid^ and free chlorine; but the formation of per-chloric acid  does not take place in the first instance, for in tlie beginning of the  process chloric acid is produced. If the fluid is evaporated in the  earlier stage of the decomposition before the crystalization of the per-  chlorate of potassa commences, the well known rhombic plates of  chlorate of potassa are obtained.  While the oxygen evolved at the positive pole produces these  oxydizing eff'ects, no gas escapes at the negative, since the hydrogen  there liberated also enters into several combinations. One part of  this hydrogen replaces one or two equivalents of chlorine, and forms  acids HO + ( ^ ) nf )^2 ^s) Chloro-formyl-hypo-sulphuricacid, and  HO + ( ) C\\}^^ ^^' Chloro-elayl-hypo-sulphuric acid â€” two acids  which are described by Kolbe in vol. 54 of Liebig's Annals. Anotber  part of the hydrogen combines with the liberated chlorine and pro-   390   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.   Fi?. 158.   duces muriatic acid. But these acids are also oxydized at the positive  pole, and thus this process of oxydation is continued until the whole  of the chlorine in the solution is either changed into per-chloric acid  or evolved in the gaseous form.  These phenomena of decomposition may be explained by supposing  the decomposition of water to be the primary, the oxydation of the  acid the secondary, effect. Daniell's theory of the electrolysis of solu-  tions of salts is here entirely inapplicable. According to this theory,  the salt should be considered as K -\\- (C, CI3) 83 Og ; the acid combi-  nation at the positive pole ought to be separated into two equivalents  of sulphuric acid and the insoluble sesqui-chloride of carbon Cj CI3.  The oxydation of the chlorine absolutely requires the supposition  of a primary decomposition of water.  Â§ 1 80. Eledrolysisof valerianic and acetic acid. â€” Kolbe, by subjecting  organic substances to electrolysis, and accurately observing the course of  their decompositions, has initiated a method which promises to become  of great importance to science. We shall here follow Kolbe's researches  as far as is necessary for the comprehension of the electrolytic part of  the phenomena^ without entering upon the discussions of the consti-  tution of the organic substances examined.  Kolbe's memoir on the electrolysis of organic compounds is to be  ibund in full in the Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, vol. LXIX,  page 257.  As free valerianic acid is a bad  conductor of the galvanic current,  Kolbe used for the electrolytic de-  composition a concentrated aque-  ous solution of its potassa salt.  The decomposition-apparatus was  arranged, as shown in fig. 158.  The glass-cylinder was about 11  inches high and 2\\ inches wide.  The exterior metallic cylinder  was of copper, the interior of  platinum foil. The copper cyl-  inder was connected with the  negative, the platinum cylinder  with the positive pole of a bat-  tery, consisting of four Bunsen's  cups.  When this apparatus was filled with a solution of valerianate of  potassa KO + (Cg H^) C2 O3, and the current passed, as indicated,  through the fluid, a brisk evolution of gas took place at both the poles,  and at the same time light oily drops of a slightly yellow tinge, and  an agreeable etheric odor appeared upon the surface of the fluid. The  very odoriferous gases escaping contained (after all atmospheric air had  been expelled from the apparatus) not a trace of oxygen. The mixture  of gases consisted of hydrogen, carbonic acid, and a third gas, burning  with a brilliant flame, and which gave to the mixture its peculiar odor.  After the action of the current had continued for several hours, the    RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 391  stratum of oil collected upon the fluid had reached a height of several  lines, and the greatest part of the valerianate of potassa had been  clianged into carbonate and bi-carbonate of potassa^ the latter of  which usually partly crystalized at the end of the process. In order  to ascertain at which pole each of these products appeared, Kolbe  placed the platinum plate in a porous clay cell, which was closed air-  tight at the top and i)rovided with a tube for conducting oif the gas  evolved. This cell, filled with valerianate of potassa, was set in a  glass vessel also containing a solution of this salt, and in which the  copper cylinder serving as the negative pole was placed. AVith this  arrangement it was found that of the above mentioned products of  decomposition, besides free potassa, only hydrogen occurred at the  negative pole, while all the others, the essential oil, the carbonic acid,  and the odorous gas, accompanied by free acid, (the arrangement of  the apparatus prevented tlie formation of carbonate of potassa^) ap-  peared at the positive pole.  Kolbe then proceeded to an accurate examination of the individual  products of decomposition. At first he investigated the oily flnid.  It soon appeared that the crude oil was not a single substance. By a  process which cannot here be described in detail, lie found the crude  oil to be a mixture of two different substances. After purification,  the volume was reduced to about one-half, and the fluid thus obtained  was limpid and colorless, of a very agreeable ether-like odor, and of  a flat and afterwards burning taste. It is soluble in alcohol and ether,  but not in water, boils at 108Â°, is very inflammable, and of remarkably  low specific gravity, viz: 0.694.  The chemical formula of this body, which Kolbe calls valyl, is Cg  Hg, i. e., it consists of 8 equivalents of carbon, and 9 equivalents of  hydrogen.  The crude oil is valyl mixed with Cg Hg -|- (Cg Hg) Cg O3, viz :  with valerianate of oxide of valyl. The odorous gas which escapes  with the carbonic acid, is also a hydro-carbon, viz : Cg H3, and there-  fore of the same composition as olefiant gas, to which it is also analo-  gous in its relation to chlorine^ but its specific gravity is twice as  great.  The whole course of these decompositions is now easily compre-  hended. By the oxygen evolved in consequence of the electrolysis at  the positive pole, the valerianic acid (C^ H^) Cj O3 is oxydized and  broken up into valyl C3 Hy and carbonic acid, or rather the valyl itself  undergoes again a partial oxidation, and forms oxide of valyl Cy H,, 0,  which combines with valerianic acid and produces with the remaining  valyl the crude oil. Besides this, a secondary oxidation of the valyl  occurs by reason of the nascent oxygen abstracting from it 1 equiv. of  hydrogen to form water, wheieby the substance C^ Jl^ homologous  with olefiant gas is produced, which, with the carbonic acid, escapes at  the -}- pole.  Acetic acid undergoes similar decompositions by the influence of the  galvanic current. Acetic acid being too poor a conductor, Kolbe  also used its potash salt for his experiments. Acetic acid (G, H3)  C2 O3, like valeric acid is oxidized at the -\\- pole, and thereby sepa-  rated into methyl Cj H3 and carbonic acid C2 0^ or rather 20 O2,   392 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  which both escape as gases at the -f- pole, while the equivalent of  hydrogen corresponding to the oxidizing oxygen at the positive pole  is evolved at the â€” pole. If we consider the pure acetic acid to he  combined with 1 equiv. of water, the^ process is simply explained by  the electrolysis of the equivalent of water, and the oxidation of the  acid resulting therefrom in the following manner:  C H , 2 vol.  H0+ (aHg) 0^03=^0, Hg 2 vol.  (2CO2 4 vol.  The examination of the gasses evolved shows, how'ever, that, in pro-  portion to the methyl, more hydrogen and carbonic acid are contained  in the gaseous mixture. But this discrepancy is also easily explained.  The process would be as indicated in the above equation if only one  equivalent of water was electrolized ; but the electrolysis also extends  to another part of the water of the solution, and thereby, on the one  hand, the quantity of hydrogen is increased, and on the other, a part  of the methyl is oxidized to carbonic acid and water, and in this way  a greater proportion of carbonic acid is produced. Besides the methyl  always contains a small quantity of oxide of methyl.  Â§ 181. Electrotype. â€” After de la Kive already in September, 1836,  (Philos. Magazine, Dingier, Poly. Jour., 105 vol.) had directed atten-  tion to the fact, that in a Daniell's battery the precipitated copper can be  scaled off from that of the battery, presenting a microscopically accurate  copy of its surface, it occurred to Jacobi and Spencer, almost simul-  taneously as it seems, to make a practical application of this fact. In  this they were decidedly successful, as is generally known.  Jacobi first made, in 1839, a Daniell's battery, in which an engraved  copper-plate was employed, but he also made at the same time, experi-  ments in a separate decomposing cell, where another copper-plate was  placed as the anode opposite to the engraved plate, and thus he kept  the solution of the sulphate of copper always saturated.* He also  soon found out that an acidulated solution of sulphate of copper is  more effective, and that the copper precipitated is pulverulent when  the current is two powerful ; he observed that generally not more than  fifty to sixty grains of copper per square inch can be reduced during  twenty-four hours, when it is required to be compact. In order to de-  . termine more exactly the force of current he used a common compass.  Jacobi soon after published a memoir on this subject, entitled '^Die  Gcdva7ioplastik,\" Petersburg, 1840. Spencer's experiments (Din-  gler's Journal, 75 vol., 1840, and Mechanics' Magazine, No. 846)  were, according to him, commenced as far back as 1837; he did not  use a separate decomposing cell, but a Daniell's battery, like Jacobi's,  with a diaphragm of plaster of Paris, (instead of which unglazed  earthenware may also be used,) and common salt with the zinc. The  diaphragm was placed vertically in a trough of corresponding dimen-  sions and thus formed the two cells. That the zinc ought not to be  amalgamated, and that its thickness should be in a certain, but not  <* The pliencmcnon mentioned in Â§ 176, that the copper does not pass to the negative  pole, has here no disturbing iniiuence since the distance of the plates is always veiy small,  and the ancde is usually placed above the kathode.   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 393  given, proportion to that re(j[uired for the hiyer of copper, as Spencer  at first stated, has in no respect been confirmed by subsequent experi-  ence. Spencer originally intended to fill the traces drawn in a plate  thickly coated with varnish, expecting that the galvanic precipitate  would adhere firmly to the copper below, and thus serve for printing  after the manner of a wood cut ; but he never obtained in this way  results of any practical value. The reduced copper would not adhere  to the plate until the latter had been acted upon by nitric acid. He  had already experimented extensively when he first published his re-  searches on the subject. He copied engraved copper-plates by gal-  vanism, or pressed them into lead and used the impressions as moulds,  covering the engraved plate while warm with wax, which was after-  wards carefully wiped off, for the purpose of preventing the adhesion of  the deposit; he also made moulds of plaster of Paris and clay, which  were coated with boiled linseed oil, and when this was dry, with mastic  varnish, and afterwards covered with bronze powder or gold leaf;  these moulds were connected with the zinc plate by a copper wire  coated with varnish or sealing-wax.  The original idea of Spencer, to produce types in relief for printing,  was afterwards modified by Von Kobell, in Munich. â€” (Patent of 1841,  Dingler's Journal, vol. 95.) He covered a copper-plate thickly with  engraver's varnish, which was made to conduct by means of finely  powdered and elutriated graphite ; larger places, which were not in-  tended to print, (lights,) were separately covered with wax, by means  of a brush, and covered with a conducting substance. The entire  plate was then covered with copper under the action of the battery.  To facilitate the separation, Von Kobell, in previous experiments,  already had slightly silvered engraved plates by immersing them in a  solution of chloride of silver and common salt. But the same method  has been described by Palmer, under the name of Glyphography, in  volume 95 of Dingier.  Afterwards the apparatus, when no separate decomposing cell was  used, was, according to Jacobi's direction, arranged in the following  manner : I'he zinc was placed horizontally upon pieces of wood or  glass, in a wooden or glass vessel, the bottom of which was formed in  the smaller ones of bladder, and in the larger ones of stronger animal  membrane, or even of tanned calf skin. This vessel was set in  another larger one, and suitably supported at a distance of one to  four inches from its bottom ; upon a copper-plate in the larger vessel  the plate to be covered was laid, after it had been carefully greased,  and wiped off, or silvered. The edge of the lower plate, so far as not  covered by that serving as a mould, was coated with wax. To it were  soldered, according to its size, one or more copper wires covered with  wax, dipping into mercury cups, into which were led an equal number  of wires connected with the zinc. In this way the apparatus could  easily be taken apart for inspection when required. The zinc was  immersed in very dilute sulphuric acid, as in Daniell's battery, and  the mould in a solution of sulphate of copper, kept saturated by pow-  dered crystals suspended in a bag. Into moulds of plaster of Paris, or  clay, wires were fastened, which were covered with wax to prevent   394 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  the deposit of copper, to obviate difficulty in the subsecLuent separa-  tion of the plate.  In order to separate the copper-plates they were put into a vice  and filed around their edges, and when a cleft was observed a horn  spatula or other similar tool was introduced to produce the separation,  which was assisted sometimes by a gentle heat. The plate first obtained  serves again as a mould, but the separation from this is accomplished  without difficulty.  Sometimes an apparatus, similar to the one just described, is used,  in which several smaller objects are placed at the same time upon the  lower copper-plate. \"When the process is continued for several days,  the apparatus has to be taken apart every day in order to remove pro-  jections upon the precipitated copper by the file, to renew the acid-  ulated water at the zinc, and also to remove impurities deposited from  the solution of the sulphate of copper and from the zinc itself.  But the electric copying of copper-plates was attended by several  difficulties. Gerlach, for instance, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 82, and  Journal fur Practische Chemie, September, 1841,) observed that the  galvanic copper-plates are very brittle, and that although this pro-  perty could be removed by the application of heat, yet in this case the  linear expansion amounts to -^2} which, when unequal, might even pro-  duce distortions. Gerlach, from some of his experiments^ seems to  think that raising the temperature of the plates only to the heat of  melting tin might remedy the brittleness without producing the  objectionable expansion, but gives no exact information on this point.  It was also found that the copy sometimes firmly adiiered to the  original, or caught in lines which were undercut, and Eisner, there-  fore, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 80_, and Journal fur Practische Chemie^  1841, vol. 22,) considered it hazardous to subject very valuable plates  to this process. The contractions which take place in the moulds,  especially when of plaster of Paris, the risk of bending the precipi-  tated deposit on removing it from the mould, or in filling up the  back, &c,, do not admit of applying the electrotype for copying scales  or other measuring instruments. Besides, according to De la Rive,  (Dingler's Journal, vol. 99,) such plates stand but few impressions,  and especially the lines of wood cuts copied by means of galvanism  are said to be frequently hollow, because in deep traces the solution  of the sulphate of copper is not properly renewed as it is decomposed,  and therefore becomes exhausted, and the deposition ceases until the  line overgrows laterally ; it is also said that vermilion cannot be used  for printing from these plates, because mercury separates, which is  not the case with ordinary engraved plates. Vogel, of Francfort, on  this account, (Dingler's Journal, 110 vol.,) made impressions, espe-  cially of steel plates, in wax, powdered over with graphit, which pro-  ceeding was repeated after the impression was made, and removed the  excess with a bellows.  An original idea of Vogel was to cover the etched plate after remov-  ing the varnish, (an engraved one had previously to be treated with  dilute nitric acid,) entirely with the precipitate, then to grind it off  again to the original surface of the plate in order to obtain all the  traces filled in the manner of inlaid work, (Dingler's Journal, 106   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 6\\)b  vol.) How far tins idea has been practically successful, for instance,  \"by precipitating silver upon iron, I do not know. Knoblaucli proposed,  (Dingler's Journal, 105 vol.,) by deposition upon a well made copper  plate, to produce plates for engravers ; because they would be without  any defective places and already formed with a plane and polished  surface. Stereotype plates may be immediately deposited upon im-  pressions made on wax covered with lead foil. Such plates, as well as  electrotype copies of wood-cuts are always made very thin and after-  wards tinned on the back by the aid of chloride of zinc, and then  filled up with type metal. From wood-cuts, the mould is made either  by an electrotype, the surface of the wood having been made to con-  duct by graphite, or else by impression in wax, &c. But when wood  has to be immersed in a fluid, the parts not to be covered should be  doubly protected â€” first, by a coating of sheet lead, and over this again  by another of wax. Von Kobell made a peculiar application of the  galvanic production of copper plates, under the name of galvan-  ography. â€” (Presented to the academy at Munich, May 4, 1840.) He  painted, after the manner used with India ink, wdth a solution of  damar resin in spirits of turpentine, with the addition of oxide of iron,  upon a polished copper plate, and had it galvanically covered with  copper without previously making it conducting. The plate thus  obtained is immediately ready for printing ; the brightest lights are  the places where no varnish has been applied. The overgrowing of  the varnished places proceeds in part from points of the copper un-  derneath acting through the varnish, but also in part from the uncov-  ered places. But since these plates do not allow of many impressions,  they may be multiplied by the electrotype method. Yon Kobell has  explained this process in a separate treatise. â€” (Munich, published by  Cotta.)  For electrotype copies of other objects than copper plates^ moulds  usually must be made first. They are obtained either by impressions  made in soft lead plates or from cliches in a fusible alloy, or by casts  of plaster and wax, or of plaster alone, or else of wax alone, or of a  mixture of equal parts of wax and rosin.  As to the metallic moulds no metal can be used which is acted upon  by the solution of sulphate of copper, as iron, tin, zinc ; these require  a previous electro-plating with silver. Bottger, in the Frankfort Gew-  erhefreund of 1840, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 78,) recommends an alloy  of 8 bismuth, 8 lead, 3 tin, (melting at 86Â°R.,) and advises the use  of metallic moulds wherever they are applicable. He pours the fused  metal into a paper box, stirs it with an iron wire until it begins to  thicken, and then presses the object to be moulded upon it until it  cools. Impressions in thin lead which has been cleaned with ley, are  also recommended by BOttger ; they are taken in a press or vise upon  moistened pasteboard. Very fragile objects may be covered with lead  foil, (tin foil is not applicable,) rubbing it carefully with a little pad  of cotton ; before taking it ofi\", a mixture of wax and rosin must be  poured over it ; but for such objects casts are preferable.  For casting moulds with melted wax combined with plaster or with  plaster alone, or with a mixture of wax and rosin, it is only necessary  that the object to be copied should be surrounded by a strip of paper   396 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  and the fluid mass, free from air bubbles, poured upon it ; when tlie mass  is cooled and hardened it can be taken off without difficulty. Moulds  of plaster of Paris must afterwards be soaked in melted wax to make  them water-proof. Gutta percha is also used for moulds ; it is slowly  heated in water, and when dried exposed to a moderate pressure in  a vise in contact with the object to be moulded. To render these or  wooden moulds conducting, Spencer, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 77, p.  343,) after finding gilding with gold leaf or dusting with graphite  either too expensive or unsatisfactory, took 3 Jo of phosphorus, dis-  solved it in one part of strong alcohol in a water bath, immersed the  mould for some seconds in a weak solution of nitrate of silver, and  exposed it to the vapors evolved from the solution of phosphorus  heated in a watch glass on a sand bath. Instead of this last process,  Bottger proposed to place the mould, when soaked in nitrate of silver,  in a vessel into which non-inflammable phosphuretted hydrogen is con-  ducted. The latter is obtained by gently heating in a retort a few  small pieces of phosphorus with alcohol and caustic potassa. At  present such moulds are commonly powdered over with finely elutriated  graphite or finely divided silver, and the excess removed with a soft  brush.  The reproduction of round forms by the electrotype offers consid-  erable difficulties ; a separate decomposing cell has generally to be  used, and the surface of the element must be nearly equal to or larger  than that to be coated. Jacobi proceeded in the>following manner :  He made a conducting surface on a bust, in alio relievo, moulded in  wax, covered it very thinly by means of galvanism, removed the wax  by melting, cleaned the mould thus obtained with spirits of turpen-  tine, and then precipitated upon the inside a thicker layer of copper,  from which he attempted to scale off the exterior thin cover, (Ding-  ler's Journal, vol. 78,) but did not succeed without injuring the copy  obtained. A Mr. Soyer, in Paris, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 78,) repro-  duced, in this way, a bust tolerably free from imperfections, and im-  mediately offered to make, for the sum of 200,000 francs, an electro-  type copy of the well known great elephant. Fortunately for bioa,  nobody accepted the offer. The Duke Max Von Leuchtenberg fol-  lowed a similar method, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 80.) His electrotype  operations are conducted on the grandest scale, as may be seen from  the fact that the black powder deposited on the copper anodes, from  impurities in the copper and sulphuric acid employed, and which had  to be removed every twelve hours, amounted in a period of about two  years to forty \"puds,\" (about 1,444 pounds.)  In the laboratory of Stiglemeyer they were not more successful in  reproducing statues on a large scale. A Mr. Moyle, (Dingler's Jour-  nal, vol. 80, Sturgeon's Annals of Electricity,) says that he produced  such figures over moulds of wax, which he afterwards melted out, but  alleges that he has also obtained with silver results of the greatest  perfection. The Society for Encouraging Industry, in Prussia, offered  a premium for the electrotype production of a larger statue, which  was awarded to Mr. Von Hackewitz, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 108 ;  Transactions of the Society of 1848.) He made, over the model, a  mould in pieces, of two parts wax, two turpentine, one rosin, and five   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 397  graphite; rendered first the lower pieces and their joints conducting,  and suspended zinc in dilute sulphuric acid in bags of\" animal mem-  brane so that it was nowhere in contact with the mould. He then  added the solution of the sulphate of copper and connected the zinc  with the conducting mould. When the first thin coating was formed  in two successive pieces of tlie mould, they were placed together, and  the zinc in the bag put in conducting connexion with the joint ; more  copper was then precipitated, and in this way the separate thin pieces  were united into one. In this manner all the parts of the statue were  connected, with the exception of the arms, which were made separately  in a similar way. As no bags with zinc could be introduced into the  very narrow parts, separate batteries had to be used in such cases for  the first coating. Such a procedure may be adopted for the sake of  obtaining a premium, but it certainly proves that so far no really  practical results have been obtained. A method similar to that used  in this case for uniting the separate pieces h&s been employed for  soldering copper rings by means of galvanism; the rings are protected  by varnish, but the surfaces to be joined are left bright, and the  copper is deposited until the whole space is filled.  A peculiar application of tlie electrotype was made by I\\Iallet and  Meillet, in covering glass and porcelain vessels with a thin copper  co&ting on the parts to be exposed to fire. Mallet covered the vessels  with Canada balsam and graphite, but Meillet used gum and nitrate  of silver dried in a flame ; intense heat, however, destroys this con-  ducting coating between the vessel and the copper deposited upon it,  which latter becomes loose. M. Simson, in 1843, proposed (Dingler's  Journal, vols. 89 and 91) to act upon the places to be covered by ade- '  posit of copper with hydrofluoric acid to remove the jDolished surface,  and then to rub them over with graphite by means of a cork. Mohr  saw such vessels in the Paris exhibition of 1844 ; reported on them as  quite new in Dingler's Journal, vol. 103, and tried to imitate them.  But he used copal varnish and bronze powder, and therefore his coating  was only firm where it could embrace the vessel, as in retorts, but not  in evaporating dishes. Afterwards experiments were again made on  this subject by Eisner. â€” (Dingler's Journal, vol. 108.) He again  made use of varnish and graphite, and also applied the etching pro-  cess ; when the places had been covered Avith a mixture of flour-spar  and sulphuric acid for twenty-four hours, and then, after washing,  rubbed over with graphite, the deposit adhered firmly even upon  evaporating dishes, exactly as stated by Simson years before, though  Eisner does not mention this. It has been attempted by Mallet to  connect glass tubes in this manner; their ends were ground even, and  for a distance of one-half to one inch rendered conducting by means of  varnish and graphite. But the joining of the ends as well as the im-  mersion of the tubes present peculiar difficulties. For the latter  purpose the vessel must be perforated, and the openings closed with  clay after the introduction of the tubes, before pouring in the solution  of sulphate of copper.  Talbot, Steinheil, and also Wheatstonehave experimented in re-pro-  ducing metallic mirrors by the electrotype process. Talbot endeavored  to make the copper mirrors white by exposing them to the vapor of   398 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  hydrosulphuret of ammonia, but Steinheil gilded them. The original  metallic mirrors can be used as moulds without any special prepara-  tion. Steinheil took great care to obtain the first deposit perfectly-  pure; for this purpose he made use of a separate decomposing cell, and  immersed a proof-plate first to ascertain whether the action was regular  and the precipitate even and rose-colored. Afterwards he placed the  mould in an ordinary, simple apparatus, and continued the operation  until the mirror was one inch thick. Projections, &c., he removed  every day with a file. As yet this process seems to have led to no  practical results. â€” (Dingler's Journal, vol. 99.)  Electrotype copies of daguerreotypes, which had been previously  gilded, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 91, Philos. Magazine, September,  1843,) were proposed by Draper; but they appear to have led to no  result, or at least not to that desired. Still less practically successful  was Napier's process; he deposited copper upon linen cloth in order  to make it water-proof. The weight of this coating was intended to  to be only 12 ounces per square yard. â€” (Dingler's Journal, vol. 91.)  In order to procure the solution of sulphate of copper required for  such purposes at a less price, Schubert advises (Dingler's Journal, vol.  81; Erdmann & Marchand's Journal fur Practische Chemie, 1841, No.  11,) to buy from coppersmiths the copper ashes (scale,) to mix them  with sulphuric acid of 15-20Â° Baume to the consistency of paste, and  let them remain thus for twenty-four hours upon plates of stone ware,  and then wash them with sulphuric acid of the same strength. This  last process is to be repeated until either the copper ashes are exhausted  or the acid is saturated. The former is the case when the ashes on  being moistened no longer become red, and the latter is seen from the  saturated color and the cessation of the acid reaction. Instead of fresh  sulphuric acid in the after washings, the fluid may be used which has  been partially exhausted in the electrotype process.  Â§ 182. Gilding, silvering, etc., by means of galvanism. â€” It had already  been observed for some time that in certain cases metals precipitated  in a compact state and adhered firmly to pole wires immersed in  metallic solutions, and it had also been suggested that in this way an  entire coating of one metal upon another might be obtained; but De  la Eive first made a distinct application of this by showing how a solu-  tion of gold must be decomposed by means of galvanic currents, in  order to coat an object, when forming the negative pole, uniformly with  a thin layer of gold.  De la Rive (Dingler's JournaljVol. 76; ComptesEendus,1840,p. 578,)  used a solution of chloride of gold â€” 40 to 80 grains metallic gold to 1  pound of water â€” in a bladder, and suspended it in water, acidulated  with \"a few drops\" of sulphuric acid, in which the zinc was placed;  the object to be gilded was connected with the zinc by means of a copper  wire, and immersed in the solution of gold; after a short time he took  it out, washed it, rubbed it well with a clean linen cloth and immersed  it again, and he repeated this several times. After a few immersions  he considered that the object was sufiiciently gilded, and that a longer  continuation of the operation was of no use. Among the reasons  which led him to this process he mentions the following: \"3. The  property of the electric current of passing the more readily from a fluid   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 399  to a metal, and vice versa the more readily this metal is acted iipon by  the fluid. In the case given the metal immersed in the solution of  gold is more easily attacked than the gold itself; as long, therefore, as  the immersed part is not entirely gilded, the current will seek the  points in the metal to be gilded which are still uncovered, and will  deposit gold upon them, whatever may be the length of the path it has  to traverse through the liquid, i. e., however irregular the form of the  object to be coated.\" The objects to be gilded had a clean metallic  surface given to them, and remained after the gilding either malt or  polished, as they had been before. The gilding thus produced by De  la Rive was therefore in all cases only thin ; he gave no quantitative  indications either of the force of current or of the weight of the gold  precipitated. At first De la Rive gilded directly only silver and brass;  iron had to be previously coated with copper. Bottger repeated these  experiments with a solution of gold as nearly neutral as possible, and  thought that he observed a reddening of the ol3Ject wlien the conducting  copper wire was immersed in the solution of gold. He says tbat copper  cannot be gilded at all when the solution of gold contains even but  traces of copper; then copper only can be precipitated, and De la Rive,  according to him, must be mistaken in his statement of the necessity  of previously coppering iron objects ; he succeeded very well in gilding  steel pens, &c., withou-t the use of copper. â€” (Dingler's Journal, vol.  78; Frankfurter Gewerbefreund fur 1840, No. 10.) With chloride of  platinum objects can in the same manner be thinly platinized.  Bottger considers 5 to 6 immersions of one minute each sufficient for  a strong gilding.  Iron can certainly be lightly gilded with chloride of gold without  previously being coated with copper, and Arago laid before the academy  a watch-spring gilded by Dent (Dingler's Journal, voh 80, p. 399,  Compt. Rend., vol. 12, 1841, p. 779,) and stated that a Mr. Perrot, at  Rouen, had previously already done the same thing, but would not  present it to the academy before he had gilded an entire watch while  it was going ! But the gilding and silvering process only became prac-  tically useful after the employment of the cyanogen compounds. Elk-  ington had a manufactory of jewelry at Birmingham, where the gilding  and silvering were done by immersion, and where also experiments  were made in gilding with chloride of gold by means of galvanism.  But when John Wright, a surgeon, had made use of the compounds  of cyanogen, Elkington at once understood the great importance of the  matter, and bought the right of this invention to incorporate it in the  specification of his process of gilding, for which he had just applied  for a patent. In France, also, he procured a patent, and there had to  compete with Von Ruolz, whose patent was of an earlier date by some  days. Afterwards they ibrmed a partnership.  Elkington always employed a separate decomposing cell, and used  for gilding either three pounds cyanide of potassium, ten pounds of  water, and five ounces of oxide of gold, or two pounds cyanide of  potassium, ten pounds of water, and two ounces of oxide of gold ;  thick coatings in this process became matt, and had to be scoured with,  a wire brush. Iron had to be coppered ; for this purpose it was placed   400 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  in contact witli zinc in sulphuric acid diluted to one-half until it was  perfectly clean, and then in an acidulated saturated solution of sul-  phate of copper in a brass vessel, with which the iron was brought in  contact. V. Ruolz used either cyanide of gold dissolved in cyanide  of potassium, or cyanide of gold in prussiate of potash, (yellow or  red,) or else sulphuret of gold in neutral sulphuret of potassium ;  and though the latter is reported as the best by the commission which  examined the subject, (Dingler's Journal^ vol. 83, Comptes Rendus,  November, 1841,) their experiments were all made with the cyanogen  compounds only. In one of these experiments one gramme of dry  chloride of gold was dissolved in 100 grammes of water with ten  grammes of yellow prussiate of potash, and the battery used con-  sisted of six Daniell's elements, each plate of which was two decimetres  square. The precipitate was found to be proportional to the time,  and amounted, on a brass plate of fifty square centimetres, to 0.063  grammes of gold per minute when the fluid was heated to 60Â° C,  0.0296 grammes when heated to 35Â°, and 0.0126 grammes with a  temperature of 15Â° ; while, according to the comparative experiments  of Dumas, with fire gilding upon a like surface, 0.1297 grammes were  deposited as a maximum, and 0.0214 grammes as a minimum, and by  the wet way only 0.0137- â€” 0.0211 grammes.  Similar results were obtained by the commission with solutions of  one part of cyanide of silver in 100 of water and ten of yellow prus-  siate of potash. But with cyanide of platinum the coating was one  hundred times slower ; with the double chloride of platinum and  potassium dissolved in caustic potassa, the commission of the Academy  states that the results were equal to those obtained with gold. The  experiments in coating with copper, tin, cobalt, and nickel, are very  superficially reported ; of nickel, its easy precipitation upon iron is  only mentioned, and in coating iron with zinc its favorable electrical  action in protecting the iron is pointed out, while V. Ruolz after-  wards alleges (Dingler's Journal, vol. 86, Comptes Rendus, August,  1842, No. 6) that iron covered with zinc is more easily rusted at bare  spots than that coated with lead or tin ; which experience is also con-  firmed by Eisner, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 88.)  The circumstances which were concerned in producing these con-  tradictory experiments are not to be ascertained from the respective  memoirs. But when the commission adds, \" We are convinced that,  by this process, iron can be coated with brass ; it needs only that  copper and zinc should be precipitated upon it, and then the object,  surrounded by coal dust, is to be heated to redness, whereby brass  will be produced,\" it appears very much like a conviction obtained at  the desk, and may be considered as that additional part of the new  invention which every such commission thinks it a matter of duty to  contribute.  The new process met with general favor, and it was soon found  that equally good results were obtained with a solution four to six  times more dilute, and that the use of one element only, or of the  simple battery in which the zinc was placed in a solution of table salt,  was more convenient. But with large quantities of the solution, and   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 401  a lon<if continued operation, the odor of prussic acid proved injurious,*  and the prussiate of potash frequently produced a hluish green sedi-  ment, (Eisner, Dingler's Journal, vol. 88,) while the cyanide of  potassium was too expensive, before Liebig had made known his new  method of preparing it. At first, also, the gilding was not made  heavy enough, singular notions of saving gold being then prevalent,  and in tliis way the process fell into disrepute witli the public, and,  in fact, fire gilding can never be made so poor as that done by means  of galvanism. At first, too, especial importance was attributed to  the fact that the articles could be entirely finished before exposing  them to the process of gilding, and only after some experience it was  ascertained that heavy gilding was always without polish (matt;)  that by the use of varnish or wax certain places could be protected  against the deposit of gold was immediately observed by Ruolz, and  it was also soon known that a reddish hue might be given to the  gilding by the addition of cyanide of copper. â€” (Eisner, Dingler's  Journal, vol. 88.)  At the present time the cyanide of potassium usually employed is  that prepared after Liebig's method, as any one can make it for him-  self, although it is still rather expensive, as the product is small for  tire quantity of material employed. The following is Liebig's direc-  tion, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 84, from the Annalen der Chemie und  Pharmacie, Marz, 1842 :) Eight parts of prussiate of potash are to be  thoroughly dried by gentle calcination upon a hot iron plate ; then  powdered and intimately mixed with three parts of dry carbonate of  potassa ; put at once into a Hessian crucible previously raised to a  dull red heat, and which has to be kept at this temperature ; the  mixture melts to a brown magma, with a lively evolution of gas ;  after some minutes, when the fluid mass becomes red hot, the color  grows lighter, and after prolonged fusion the contents of the crucible  appear limpid and amber yellow. If, from time to time, a hot glass  rod is immersed and then withdrawn, the adhering substance, when,  cooled, at first is brown, after a while it is yellow, and at last, when  the operation is finished, the drop on the glass rod is limpid and  colorless like water, and congeals to a perfectly white crystalline mass.  During the fusion brownish flakes are seen floating about in the  fluid, which unite at last into a sponge-like mass, and assume a light  gray color. If the crucible is then taken from the fire and somewhat  cooled, in most cases the whole of this gray powder settles at the bot-  tom ; by stirring once or twice with the glass rod this deposition is  facilitated. The supernatant fused mass can now easily be poured  out into a heated porcelain dish, so that, with a little care, not a par-  ticle of the sediment passes over.  This mass is then broken to pieces and preserved in well-closed  vessels, as it readily deliquesces and decomposes when liquified.  The solution of gold is j^i'epared in the following manner : The  gold is rolled thin, cut up, and then heated in a porcelain dish, on  a water bath with seven times its weight of muriatic acid, to which  â€¢~\" In tliis case ventilation is tlie only applicable remedy ; but, in iuldition, the cyanogen  compounds produce all the symptoms of poisoning with prussic acid when brought into  contact with sore hands, &c., and the greatest precaution is certainly advisable.  26   402 EECENT PEOGRESS IN PHYSICS.  nitric acid is added, from time to time, until all the gold is dissolved;,  or ten to twelve times its weight of aqua regia may at once be taken ;  the solution is then evaporated to dryness. The chloride of gold thus  obtained is dissolved in water, and the yellow protechloride separated  by filtration ; carbonate of soda is then added until a feeble alkaline  reaction is observed, and at last the solution of cyanide of potassium  (one part of salt to ten to twenty of water) is stirred in. When all  is well dissolved, and the solution, which at first appeared turbid, is  again clear, it is boiled for half an hour. When the color of the.  gilding becomes impure, carbonate of soda is again to be added, and  the boiling repeated, or more cyanide of potassium may be used,  especially if the gold at the anode is no longer perfectly dissolved. â€” â–   (Ryhiner, Dingler's Journal, vol. 110.) A fine red color is obtained  when the process is carried on at a moderately elevated temperature.  The silver solution consists of one part crystallized nitrate of silver in  thirty- two distilled water, to which solution of cyanide of potassium  is added until the precipitate which at first appears is again dis-  solved. â€” (Eisner, Dingler's Journal, vol. 88.) Freshly precipitated  and well washed chloride of silver is also used ; as much of this i&  stirred at intervals into a solution of one-tenth cyanide of potassium  in one of water as can be dissolved, and then as much more cyanide of  potassium and water is added. This solution may also be used for  electrotype silver work. For the copper solution, one part of sulphate  of copper in twelve of water are used, and the process conducted as  with the silver. But coppering does not succeed well with a single  pair ; a battery of at least two or three elements should be used.  I omit here a number of suggestions in reference to the use of other  compounds, because they never came into practice, and I shall only  mention that the addition of a minute quantity of sulphuret of carbon  is especially favorable to the precipitation. â€” (Millward and Lyons,  Dingler's Journal, vol. 108, from the Repertory of Patent Inventions,  February, 1848.) Five ounces of sulphuret of carbon are mixed with,  six quarts of the gilding fluid, and of this mixture two ounces are  daily added to every ten quarts of the solution of metallic cyanide.  This is confirmed by Elkington, at least for silver. â€” (Dingler's  Journal, vol. 114, from the Practical Mechanic's Journal, October,  1849.) Peculiar difficulties occurred in the platinizing j^rocess as  well as in that of coating with nickel, and so far all the progress  made seems not to have rendered the processes practically applicable.  According to Fehling (Dingler's Journal, vol. 86) and Bottger (from  Annaden der Chemie und Pharraacie, September, 1843, vol. 90,) the  best results are obtained by adding a little ammonia to the chloride  of platinum and ammonia. Buttger also recommends a similar pro-  cess for nickel ; but the preparatory purification of the commercial  metal is very troublesome.  In coating iron with zinc by means of galvanism (Pelatt, Dingler's  Journal, vol. 95, from Technologiste, February, 1845,) an acid solu-  tion of sulphate of zinc, with a large anode of this metal, must be  used in order to obtain a durable deposit.  The different plans ibr gilding iron and steel without previous cop-  pering are omitted here, and I refer for those of Deebordeaux to Ding-   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. AOd  ler's Journal of 1845 and 1846. So far they have had little or no  practical success.  The idea of precipitating alloys, mentioned in the report of the  academy, though it there is represented as already confirmed by  experiment, was afterwards carried out by Von Ruolz. He actually  succeeded in depositing bronze upon iron, specimens of which lie pre-  sented to the academy, but found that the proportion of the metals  in the solutions should be different from that in the alloys required.  Von Piuolz dissolved, in 500 parts of water, a sufficient quantity of  cyanide of potassium to produce a solution of 4Â° Beaume, and added,  at a temperature of 40Â° â€” 48\"' R., first, 30 parts of cyanide of copper  and then 10 of oxide of tin ; from this deposits with 10 to 20 per cent,  of tin were obtained. Afterwards Jacobi also took up this subject  (Dingler's Journal, vol. 93, from Bulletin de St. Petersbourg) and  prepared a brass solution by using, in a solution of cyanide of potas-  sium, an anode of copper and a kathode of platinum, until the latter  became covered with copper ; he then used an anode of zinc until the  precipitate assumed the desired color ; after this he was able, by using  an anode of brass, to coat iron with brass. Although I made many  trials I could never succeed in precipitating brass in this manner, the  color of the deposit soon changed and the brass anode became black;  from some remarks it seems that Jacobi had a similar experience.  But I have obtained strong and adherent coatings of brass upon iron  by using, instead of a brass anode, one of copper and zinc together,  each of which metals could be immersed to a greater or less depth,  until the desired color was obtained. This is in accordance with the  experience of Von Ruolz.  That gold can be precipitated, alloyed with copper, has already been  mentioned ; but it is considered better to deposit at first a layer of  pure gold before adding ihe cyanide of copper to the solution of gold.  When the metallic solutions become exhausted by use, either the  force of the current has to be increased or some of tlie concentrated  solution must be added. But at present the anodes are usually made  of the metal to be precipitated, and by these the solution is kept at  the required state of concentration ; formerly the anodes Avere always  made of platinum. This expedient has already been mentioned by  Petzhold, in his memoir, \"Die galvanische Vergoldung, Versilberung  und Verkupferung, Dresden uud Leipzig, 1842 ;\" and Jacobi, in his  treatise on coating with brass, remarks that it is not at all necessary  to make metallic solutions in a chemical way ; that the solution may  be obtained by using, in a solution of cyanide of potassium, an anode  of the required metal and kathode of platinum, until the metal de-  posits upon the latter. Such anodes are made of tliinly rolled sheets  of the metal soldered to a platinum wire. In silvering, anodes of  silver are only applicable with strong currents, or cyanide of i)otas-  sium in excess ; because, according to Napier, (Dingler's Journal,  vol. 95, from Philosophical Magazine, November, l!S4i,) cyanide of  silver is formed which is insoluble in water, as well as in neutral  cyanide of\" silver and })otassium. According to Napier's researches,  the cyanide of potassium is not decomposed while silver is in the  solution.   404 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  In this same way gold, &c., may also be removed from objects when  used as anodes. This may be done with advantage when an object,  by improper management of the gilding, assumes a blackish color.  But cyanide of potassium is also a solvent for gold without the gal-  vanic current.  As to the strength of the current, experience has taught that it  must be very small, so that no bubbles of gas, or scarcely perceptible  ones, should appear on the metal to be coated. Deposits slowly formed  are more compact and adhere more firmly to the surface beneath  them.* The durability of the galvanic coating was at first doubted,  and Becquerel even proposed (Dingler's Journal, vol. 89, from Comptes  Kendus, July, 1843) to first amalgamate the piece to be gilt with ni-  trate of mercury, to gild it and then subject it to the common coloring  process, which requires a degree of heat sufficient to expel the mer-  cury. The want of durability in galvanic gildings seems, at first, not  to have been attributed to its true cause, viz: the thinness of the de-  posit. Baral (Dingler's Journal, vol. 105, from Comptes Rendus,  May, 1847,) dissolved objects which had been subjected to the process  of fire gilding, and also such as had been gilded by means of gal-  vanism, in order to examine in both cases the film of gold, and found  the galvanic coating to have more continuity, but believes that it is  less adherent, because in fire gilding a double amalgam is formed,  and after the expulsion of the mercury a part of one metal is left  intermixed with the other. But if we take into consideration that  the coating produced by fire gilding is more porous and consequently  more readily worn away, we shall feel inclined to trust in the dura-  bility of the galvanic precipitate. But, besides, experience has shown  that galvanic gilding is as durable as that produced by the old process,  provided it is of the same thickness. Objects silvered by means of  galvanism often turn yellow after a while, but this may be prevented  by soaking and washing them carefully in warm water, when taken  out of the silvering solution, (Dr. Philipp, Dingler's Journal, vol. 92,  from the Berliner Gewerb-Industrie und Handelsblatt, 1844, No. 2.)  Objects that have become yellow can be made white again by coating  them with a paste of charred cream of tartar and water, and when  this is dried by heat, boiling them in an aqueous solution of cream of  tartar ; they must then be well washed and dried. â€” (Eisner, Dingler's  Journal, vol. 93.) Mourey recommends coating the objects with borax,  and heating to a temperature just sufficient to luse the borax. â€” (Ding-  ler's Journal, vol. 97 ; from the Technologiste, June, 1845.)  With reference to the means of supplying the electric current, we  must take into consideration not only their constancy, but also the  expense and the inconvenience produced ; for instance, by the nitrous  fumes of Bunsen's or Grove's elements. For small objects a simple  apparatus is commonly used with an animal membrane as a diaphragm,  and with a solution of chloride of sodium or cyanide of potassium at  the zinc pole ; the object to be coated is then used as the other pole ;  *I have precipitated gold with violent evolution of gas to the amount of 1 milligramme  per square centimetre, and afterwards rubbed it with the linger with a piece of linen cloth,  and lastly, with a wire-brush, without taking off more than J^ of the deposited gold. Of  2 milligrammes per square centimetre, ^ of the gold was removed by a similar procedure.   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 405  but in general a separate decomposing cell is i)referable, in whicli the  anode is of gold, &c., connected with a common Daniell's battery.  The Duke Max Von Leuchtenberg, whose laboratory for galvanic  gilding is not surpassed b)'' any other, (tlie Elkiugton's operate prin-  cipally with silver,) uses plates of iron and coke charged with  sulpliuric acid, and the sulphate of iron produced covers the expense of  maintaining the battery. â€” (Dingler's Journal, vol. U7, from Technolo-  giste, August, 1845.) These batteriesare only charged on Mondays, and  thenusedjwithoccasionaladditions, day and night until Saturday, being  employed at night to decompose the exhausted gold solutions, as gold  anodes are not employed, they being considered dead capital and a  temptation to the workmen. The gold solutions, are prepared in the  laboratory in the following manner : One part of gold is dissolved in  aqua regia and evaporated to dryness, a solution of one part of caustic  potassa is added, the mixture heated and then filtered. The Duke  considers those solutions best whicli contain per decilitre 1 to 0.25  grammes of gold. The extent of this establishment may be imagined  when we learn that (Dingler's Journal, vol. 105, from Bulletin's de  r Academic de St. Petersbourg, No. 130,) three wooden vessels lined  with India-rubber held 5,500 litres of gold solution containing about  80 pounds of gold, and that sometimes in one month GO pounds were  precipitated, as when 204 pairs of copper capitals and bases for St.  Isaac's church were gilded; the total weight of these was 7,200 \" pud,\"  of 16 kilogrammes, and the surflice to be gilded was about 1,300 square  metres. During three j^ears 280 kilogrammes of gold were used ; eight  elements were usually employed as a single pair, but when the solu-  tions were nearly exhausted they were combined as a double-paired  battery, or the size of the anode was increased. If the current was  too strong, so that gas appeared at the kathode, or the object became  dark colored, the surface to be gilded was sometimes increased by  adding other objects. As soon as the precipitate appeared \" matt,'  the articles were taken out and rubbed with the wire-brush, and this  was repeated three times in order to obtain a sufficient gilding.  The application of magneto- electrical machines appears to offer con-  siderable advantages for o})erations on a large scale. It seems that  Sturgeon was the first to use them, but Woolrich first secured a patent  for their application to manufacturing purposes, which was afterwards  bought by the Elkingtons. â€” (Dingler's Journal, vol. 105, from Bul-  letin de St. Petersbourg, ISo. 130.) The latter had a machine con-  structed for their manui'actory of German silver ware, which daily  precipitated seven Russ'an pounds of silver. It consisted of eight  horse-shoe magnets, each of twelve steel plates, two and a half inches  wide, and together four inches thick. Their length from the pole to  the vertex of the arch was two and a half feet, and the arms were six  inches apart. The iron cores of the armatures were six inches long,  two and a half inches thick, and placed radially upon a wheel of two  and a half feet in diameter, towards which the magnets were also ra-  dially directed. The wheel made TOO revolutions in a minute, and the  current deposited sixteen to twenty ounces of silver in an hour.*  [*The use of this machine has been discontinued, as it was not found as advantageoui  as was originally supposed. G. C. S.]   406 EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  In the heavy work of the Duke of Leuchtenberg the quantity of  gold precipitated was determined by chemical analysis. One decilitre  of the liquor was taken out of the gauged vessel before and after the  gilding, and examined ; very convenient methods of analysis were  contrived and an account of them published. â€” (Dingier' s Journal,  vol. 99, from Bulletin Scient. Figur. de St. Petersbourg.) It is evi-  dent that, in this case, only platinum anodes could be used. Small  objects were weighed before and after the gilding. Both methods are  unsuitable for the common gilder, and he can only judge of the strength  of the gilding by the commencement of a \"matt\" appearance on the  polished places. A compass inserted in the circuit would enable any  one, after a few trials, to determine approximately the quantity of  gold precipitated in a minute, even if it were not a tangent compass.  At any rate this would always reliably indicate the state of the current,  while the workman now has no means whatever of ascertaining when  it is growing weaker, and only knows by the evolution of gas and the  darkening of the color when it is too strong.  Frankenstein introduced a new method of gilding, by which the  piece to be gilded is immersed in contact with zinc. The zinc is also  gilded or silvered, and the quantity of the precipitate is, according to  Fehling, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 78,) nearly proportional to the time.  The temperature is raised to 60Â° E., and the object must be taken out  and cleaned every ten or twenty minutes. Frankenstein recommends  for the gold solution six parts of prussiate of potash, four of carbonate  of potassa, ten of water, and one of chloride of gold; and for silver  five parts of prussiate of potash, five carbonate of potassa, two com-  mon salt, five aqua ammonia, and one chloride of silver. The liquid  should be boiled for a half to three-quarters of an hour and then de-  canted. This method has been frequently adopted by manufacturers ;  they use, however, the common solution of gold in cyanide of potas-  sium, adding a small quantity of caustic potassa or soda and wind  annealed brass wire loosel}'' around small objects, such as spoons, &c.  In this manner Frankenstein (Dingler's Journal, vol. 90) gilded the  cross and ball of a steeple in parts, and precipitated twenty-five ducats  upon a surface of fifty square feet, each piece being immersed three or  four times for five to ten minutes. The film of gold obtained by this  treatment was matt, which is always the case when as much as half a  ducat is precipitated upon a square foot. Such a gilding may, accord-  ing to the above mentioned experiments of Dumas, be considered equal  to a good fire gilding.*  Becquerel (Dingler's Journal, vol. 92, Comptes Eendus, March,  1844, No. 2) has made numerous experiments on the precipitation of  metals from their solutions upon other metals, even upon zinc, in  which latter case he ascribed the precipitation to the galvanic currents  produced by the impurities in commercial zinc. He could only, as a  general rule, obtain adherent metallic deposits by contact with zinc,  and when the metallic salt to be precipitated was combined with an  alkali to form a double salt as nearly as possible neutral. In acid  * By the use of brass wire with a piece of zinc at the end the gilding becomes reddish  in color, probably from the copper dissolved out from the brass. I have gilded iron in this  way without previous coppering.   KECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 407  liquids no adherent deposits could be produced even with the use of  separate decomposing cells.  In conclusion, it may also be mentioned that the attempt has heen  made to gild silken threads and tissues without diminishing the flexi-  bility and strength of the goods ; the Prussian Geiverbe Ferein has  offered a premium for such a process, but, as far as I know, no one has  yet been successful.  Â§ 183. Etching by galvanism. â€” It seems that Spencer first took up  this idea ; he procured a patent for his process in August, 1840. The  plate to be etched served as the anode, and was placed in a cell sepa-  rated by a porous diaphragm from the opposite copper plate. With  the copper plate acting as the kathode, sulphate of copper was always  used, but with the plate to be etched different liquids were employed  according to the nature of the metal. â€” (Dingler's Journal, vol. 80.)  For copper dilute sulphuric acid was employed, but it does not seem  that this process was ever found practically useful, since, according to  Hasse, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 84, from the Verhandlungen des Ve-  reins fiir Beforderung des Gewerbfleisses in Preussen, 1841, 5,) the  etching always proceeds more rapidly towards the border than in the  middle, and the same difliculty also occurs around such places as had  been stopped out after having been etched deep enough. Grove  (Dingler's Journal, vol. 82, from Philosophical Magazine, September,  1841) etched daguerreotype plates in the following manner: He used  one of his elements with plates of the same size as that to be etched,  placed the latter in a wooden frame, at a distance of 0,2 inches from a  Smee's platinized platinum plate, and immersed it for 20 to 30 seconds  in dilute muriatic acid, the connection with the element having been,  previously made. The daguerreotype plate was previously varnished  with shellac around its border and on the back, and after the etching  was carefully washed with aqua ammonia by means of a little pad of  cotton, then well rinsed in pure water and dried. Although the finest  lines had disappeared, still the plate gave good impressions. Grove  thinks it especially adapted for taking electrotype copies which may  be used for printing.  About the same time Steinheil, in Munich, and Fizeau, in Paris, also  made attempts to etch daguerreotype plates. Fizeau's plates bore 30  to 40 impressions.  Â§ 184. NohiU's rings. â€” Nobili's experiments are older than the period  to which my report is limited, and some of them date back as far as  the year 182G. He experimented with many liquids, and upon plates  of very different metals at the positive as well as at the negative pole.  An account of these experiments is to be found in Pogg. Ann., vol.  10, and also in Dingler's Journal, vol. 94.  Nobili obtained the most brilliant colors from acetate of lead by  placing the metallic plate at the positive pole and immersing the  negative pole in liquid liquid. It is said that he also succeeded in pro-  ducing mono-chromatic coatings, but that he never communicated the  process to any one. BiJttger obtained such coatings upon platinum from  different })roto salts of manganese (hippurates, acetates, succinates.)  The platinum plate connected with the positive pole was laid in the  jgolution, and the negative pole, which was also a circular plate, was   408 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  placed opposite to it. But it is not necessary that tlie negative pole-  should end in a plate. With a simple platinum wire the same salts  furnish nomo-chromatic tints, which successively change, so that the ex-  periment may he interrupted with any color desired. Only chloride of  manganese gave colored rings like those obtained with acetate of lead.  Bottger used solutions of 1 part of the salt in 12 to 16 parts of water,  and employed a battery of 4 elements. He gives the following as the  best mode of performing the experiment : a short platinum wire is to  be soldered to the centre of a circular platinum plate, a glass dish is'  perforated in the middle, and the plate placed in it, so that the wire  passes through a cork in the hole, and projects a little from the bot-  tom of the dish. The glass dish is then placed upon a board in which  a mercury cup is inserted, and into this dips the wire from the dish,  while another wire passing through the board connects the mercury  with the positive pole.  Eisner (Gewerbeblatt fiir Sachsen, 1842, No. 29 ; Dingler's Jour-  nal, vol. 85) applied Fechner's simple process to produce Nobili's  rings upon steel plates. He poured acid acetate of copper (solution  of verdigris in vinegar) over the plates, touched them in different  places with a zinc rod, dried them and heate 1 them over a spirit lamp,  when different colors are successively developed, and the operation  may be interrupted as soon as the desired tint is obtained. The theo-  retical reflections appended to the memoir do not appear to be based  upon quite clear ideas, and are therefore better omitted in this place.  Becquerel (Comptes Kendus, February, 1844, No. 6; Dingler's-  Journal, vol. 91) repeated the experiments of Nobili in various ways,  and obtained particularly beautiful colors upon different metals when  used as positive poles in a solution of litharge in caustic potassa, while-  the negative pole was a platinum wire or plate. Lead is precipitated  on the platinum, and on the positive pole peroxide of lead, by which  these splendid colors are produced. Becquerel boiled finely powdered  litharge for a long time in a solution of caustic potassa of 20Â° to 22\"^  Beaume, and used six Daniell's elements for his battery. But the'  colors are readily developed with much weaker solutions and with  fewer elements when small platinum plates are employed. It is only  with very fine platinum wires, covered with glass except at the points,,  that more elements are necessary, but the rings thus obtained are  more perfect in form.  Becquerel is said to have produced uniform shades by employing-  many wires projecting from the glass tube and radiating toward the  positive metallic plate. These colors resist very well v/hen rubbed with  the finer polishing powders, such as English rouge, but are changed  by being exposed to the action of acid or aramoniacal vapors. As a pro-  tection against this action, Becquerel recommends the application of two  coatings of a varnish, made as follows : ^ litre linseed oil, 4 to 8 gram-  mes finely powdered litharge^ and 2 grammes sulphate of zinc, are mod-  erately heated for several hours and then filtered. But Becquerel hini-  self admits that some of the colors are injured by this treatment. This  is also the case with shellac varnish. Becquerel has experimented with  gold, copper, silver_, (which gave no fine colors,) platinum, German  silver, and steel ; even bell-metal gave good results, but tin required   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 409  a previous, althoiigli very thin, gildinfij. The younger Becquerel  (Ann.de Chira.and de Phys., March, 1845: Dingler's Journal, vol. 9G)  directed attention to the fact that the order of the colors thus obtained  corresponds to that obtained with transmitted light, and also main-  tained that the thickness of the layers decreases from the centre of the  rings in the inverse ratio of the radii. Zur Nedden (Dingler's Jour-  nal, vol. 94) attempted to refute the opinion that the colors were pro-  duced by \" thin plates\" at all, and thinks that they arise from the  colors of the precipitated combinations and of the metals themselves.  But without disputing the influence of these two causes upon the shade  of individual colors, there cannot be the least doubt that their order,  as obtained, for instance, upon German silver is exactly the same as  that obtained from a wedge-shaped plate of gypsum when the mirrors  of the polarizing apparatus reflect the light in planes at right angles  to each other.  The above mentioned assertion of Edmund Becquerel^ that the thick-  ness of the layers is in the inverse ratio of the radii of the rings, based  upon theoretical consideretions and confirmed by measurement on two  selected plates, was opposed by Du Bois, Reymond and Benz, (Fogg.  Ann., vol. 71.) The former deduced, from accurate theoretical inves-  tigations, the law that the thickness of the stratum precipitated by  galvanic currents at different distances from the negative point must  be inversely as the cubes of the radii, and Benz proved by experiments  that this actually is the case. The discrepancy between these contra-  dictory experiments is not yet explained.  The splendid colors obtained in the manner indicated are already  used in the arts for covering table bells, cups, and other small ware of  brass plate. The solutions of oxide of lead used for this purpose is  prepared in the following manner : One part of caustic potassa is  dissolved in 5-6 water, and boiled with finely ground litharge in  excess for half an hour in an earthenware vessel, being well stirred  all the time. The solution is then filtered and preserved in a well  closed vessel. For use, the liquid is poured into a vessel of lead or  brass large enough to hold conveniently the object to be coated, which  is connected with the positive pole of a Daniell's battery of 3 pairs,  and immersed in the lead solution, when the negative pole is con-  nected with the outside of the vessel. The strength of the current  must be regulated experimentally by means of tlie charging fluids,  so that the formation of the rings, of which usually only the first two  systems are well developed, proceeds somewhat slowly, by which  means the current may w^ith more precision be interrupted just when  the desired shade is obtained. Brass requires some modifications in  the jjrocess, as Becquerel had previously noticed; objects of tliis metal  must be gradually immersed into the solution with the sharp edge  foremost, the circuit having been previously closed. All the objects  must be well cleaned with Tripoli or English rouge, and should not  afterwards be touched with the fingers ; varnish is not usually em-  ployed.  Â§ 185. Obtaining metals from their ores by mea7is of galvanism. â€” Bec-  querel devoted especial attention to the solution of this problem ; but  notwithstanding the promise of his first reports, and the considerable   410 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  amount of aid he seems to have received, no really important result  has been obtained. A report in the Comptes Eendus of 1840 (Ding-  ler's Journal, vol. 77) sets forth in brilliant colors the advantages  of the new process, but^ though a great many electrical reactions are  described, very little information c^n be found on the subject in ques-  tion, except that the method has to be modified according to the nature  of the ores, and that a slight previous roasting is required if the ores  do not contain metallic silver or sulphuret of silver ; for it was to the  ores of this metal that his first experiments were confined, although  he intended to take up the other metals in their turn. Becquerel, by  irrelevant digressions, makes it very difficult to understand his dis-  cussions, and taxes the patience of the reader.  In a later report in the Comptes Rendus of 1842, No. 4, (Dingler's  Journal, vol. 84,) Becquerel gives an account of his experiments in  separating gold. His process is as follows : The ore is dissolved in  muriatic acid, and another muriatic solution is prepared containing  all the other metals in the same proportion in which they are con-  tained in the ore. These two solutions are brought to the same den-  sity, and these serve as the exciting liquids of a simple battery, that  containing the gold being placed with a platinum plate in the inner  vessel, which has a clay stopper in its bottom, and the other in the  outer vessel with a copper plate. The circuit must be kept closed  until all the gold is deposited upon the platinum, whose increase of  weight indicates the quantity of gold precipitated. But it seems that  in the use of this process on a large scale the subsequent separation  of the gold from the platinum might present new difficulties, in addi-  tion to those which would be incurred by an imperfect exhaustion of  the solution of gold.  A similar proposition had before been made by a Mr. Byer, (Ding-  ler's Journal, vol. 80 ; from Mechanic's Magazine, No. 911,) and its  priority disputed by Martin Roberts, but rather with the view of ob-  taining a quantitative determination of ores after their qualitative  analysis. The ore properly prepared was to be dissolved, and the  solution used in a simple battery as one of the liquids, diluted muriatic  or sulphuric acid being used for the other. The metals to be employed  should be two which are nearest alike in affinity, and the metal used  as the negative pole should be the same as the one to be precipitated.  If, for instance, iron is contained in the solution, iron and zinc must  be taken, a known portion of the dissolved ore put in contact with the  weighed iron plate and the circuit kept closed until the exhaustion  of the solution of iron, which metal only, it is said, will be deposited  upon the iron plate. If there is copper in the solution, copper and  iron should be used ; and in this manner different metals may succes-  sively be separated, and their quantity determined by the increase of  weight of the negative metals.  In the Comptes Rendus of May, 1846, (Dingler's Journal, vol. 101,)  Becquerel indicates a process for decomposing silver ores which are  insoluble in water. They are placed with a solution of common salt  in a glass, with the indispensable clay stopper in its bottom, and this  is set in another glass also containing the same solution, into which  zinc is immersed connected with the ore by means of a silver wire.   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 411  The sodium, liberated by the decomposition of the chloride of sodium,  combines with the chlorine of the chloride of silver, and thus the  silver is reduced and obtained in a more or less porous condition. It  is the more compact as the current is weaker, i. e., as the solution of  salt is more dilute, and as tlie aperture closed with the clay stopper is  smaller. But tlie action had, in all cases, to be continued for several  weeks, in order to reduce only a moderate quantity of silver. But  here, too, Becquerel was not the first to describe this, or, at least, a  very similar methcd. The instrument maker and. assayer, Oechsle,  in Pfarzheim, had, in 1842, already published in Dingler's Journal,  vol. 86, the following method of reducing chloride of silver: The  chloride is worked into a thick paste with a saturated solution of  common salt, and then put into a porous cell, which is set in a vessel  containing sulphuric acid diluted to ^Lj the zinc is placed in this ves-  sel, while platinum or silver is used with the chloride of silver, and  the circuit is kept closed until the grayish sediment of silver, when  stirred no longer, shows any milky streaks ; it is then well washed  and dried. A similar process is again described in Poggendorf's  Annals, 1848, No. 11.  James Napier (Dingler's Journal, vol. 97, from Repertory of Patent  Inventions, July, 1845,) proposes to reduce the metals in a fused  state, and this he does by putting the roasted metallic sulphurets  together with the proper flux in a black lead crucible, which, with  the exception of the bottom, had been coated inside with clay. When  all is fused he places upon the mass an iron plate riveted to a rod of  the same metal, another iron rod is to be placed in contact with the  outer surface of the crucible, and both rods connected with the proper  poles of a battery.  William liitchie, in 1844, patented a process for obtaining metallic  copper, which is very similar to that described by Dechaud and  Gautier de Claubry in the Comptes Rendus of 1845, (Dingler's Jour-  nal, vol. 97.) It consists essentially in changing the sulphuret into  sulphate of copper, which is then decomposed by galvanism. The  apparatus for this purpose consists of a number of large troughs with  several divisions, each of which is again divided into two parts by a  pasteboard diaphragm. One of these parts contains sulphate of copper  and a plate of lead, or rather of sheet iron coated with lead ; tlie other  contains sulphate of iron and a cast iron plate, which, together, form  a simple battery. The inventors think that they will be able for  every square metre of plate to reduce 1 kilogramme of copper in  twenty-four hours, and that of the whole quantity of copper in the  solution they can obtain 50 per cent, in plates, 25 per cent, granu-  lated, and the remainder in a finely divided state. The apparatus is  supplied from large reservoirs containing the liquids in the proper  state of concentration, while the exhausted solution of sulphate of  copper, as well as the saturated solution of the sulphate of iron, are,  at the same time, carried off. Accurate statements as to the advan-  tages of this process are still wanting.  [Since the date of the })ublication of Miiller's report the art of elec-  trotyping has been greatly developed. The general principles of this  art, so well shown by our author, are so universally applicable that   412 EECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  a full quotation of later authors, wliicli we had at one time intended,  would be in most cases but a repetition of what has already been said.  The reproduction of works of art by this method has been amply-  illustrated in the late European industrial exhibitions. The simplest  and lowest application which has, however, had the widest employ-  ment is the following : Small figures, generally intended for parlor  ornaments, are cast in zinc, and coated externally with copper or  some alloy of copper. In this process the electrotype is not properly  applied to the reproduction of the figure, but simply to the formation  of a copper surface upon a cast already made. Another plan is to  precipitate a copper shell upon a fusible metal cast, which is afterwards  partly melted out, leaving a very light but sufiiciently solid figure.  By these methods the now common \"bronze\" ornaments are made.  Fine works are actual reproductions of the surface of a mould by  methods already explained, but those requiring more care and atten-  tion bear a correspondingly higher value.  But it is in its applications to printing that this art has had the  greatest influence. Detailed descriptions of the mode of operation are  wanting, but as to their extent we may form some idea from the state-  ment of Lieutenant E. B. Hunt, U. S. A., (in the Report of Professor  A. D. Bache, the Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey,  for 1854, p. 208, Appendix,) who, in speaking of the capacity of  printing from relief, says that \"is well illustrated by the 135,000  impressions regularly worked from the pages of Harper's Magazine.  Each page of this publication is electrotyped, a copper film coating  type and wood-cuts alike, and type metal is melted into the back of  the copper shell to give it the required thickness ; thus both type  and wood-cuts are converted into a relief copper plate, from which the  prints are worked off.\"  The perfect and certain reproduction on the large scale of the finest  specimens of the engraver's art is the most remarkable extension of  the electrotype. Of this we have the best account in the anual reports  of the United States Coast Survey.  Electrotype operations of the United States Coast Survey, Mathiot's  Improvements. â€” Although fine copper plate engravings have been  multiplied in this manner by the English ordnance survey, by the  French \" Depot de la Guerre,\" by the royal establishment at Vienna  and elsewhefe, that we are authorized in dwelling upon the methods  of our own national establishment is shown by the passage from a  letter of Colonel Blondell, director of the \" Depot de la Guerre,\" who  says of the account of the operations of the United States Coast  Survey : \" The perusal of the memoir has convinced me at once of the  superiority of the electrotype methods which are used in the United  States. The reproduction in less than three days of a plate of large  size is an improvement of the highest importance.\"  We have drawn our information from the annual reports of the  Coast Survey, but have also verified this by personal inspection, under  the favor of Professor A. D. Bache, the Superintendent, and of Mr.  Georgo Matliiot, who has charge of the electrotype department.  It should be premised that the maps of this establishment are  engraved in the highest style of art attainable under a minute division   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 413  of lalior in eacli kind of work. The fineness of the work at once ren-  dered necessary some economical reproduction of the plates, in order  that the maps might be sold at a low price, which would have been  impossible if a new engraving had to be made when each plate wore  out. The first attempts brought to light a most serious difficulty,  the copper deposit was liable to adhere, involving the partial destruc-  tion of the costly original.  B}^ an ingenious process of reasoning Mr. Mathiot was led to the  employment of iodine to prevent the adhesion of the deposit to the  matrix. It was, however, found difficult to apply the iodine uniformly.  The plates were next, previously silvered, and then washed with an  alcoholic solution of iodine, which effectually produced the desired  result. It was soon found that when the iodized plate had been ex-  posed to the action of light the separation was most easy and certain,  and this is the plan now uniformly adopted with unfailing success.  For the largest plates a solution of one grain of iodine in twenty  thousand grains of strong alcohol is used.  \" To test the effect of the chemical method of preventing adhesion  on the sharpness of the engraved lines an engraving was seven times  successively transferred from plate to plate, when the closest inspec-  tion failed to show any inferiority of impressions from the last plate  as compared with those from the first.\" â€” (Coast Survey Report for  1851, p. 544.)  The next matter of importance was to diminish the time and conse-  quently the expense of depositing large plates without impairing the  ductility of the metal. Previously the best results attained had been  the deposit of one pound of copper in twenty-foui' hours on a plate of  eight square feet, and this only under extraordinary precautions.  The desired end was attained by a succession of improvements. In  the first place the platinized silver plates of Smee's battery, the one  which Mr. Mathiot seems to prefer, were liable to a coating of impu-  rities derived from tlie zinc, (zinc itself deposited upon them?) this was  found to be removed readily by immersion in a solution of chloride of  iron. In the next place, in order to bring the plates of the battery  nearer together, to reduce the resistance, it was found necessary to  have silver more flat and true than could be made by hammering.  Such plates were finally made by electrotype deposits, by means which  we cannot now stop to describe, but which insured certainty and uni-  formity in their manufacture. After these improvements Mr. Mathiot  was able so to proportion the size and number of the elements of the  battery as to attain the required rapidity of deposit without sacrifice  of the ductility of the metal. Finally, by a sim])le contrivance for  maintaining a constant temperature above 100Â° Fahr. in the decom-  posing cell, the rapidity of the deposit and the quality of the metal  were still more improved, with the further advantage of keeping the  saturation of the copper fluid more uniform throughout its mass.  In order to maintain the exceedingly fine surface required by the  delicatfLWork on these plates, it was found necessary to make the first  immersion in a vertical ])osition, so that impurities in the solution  could not rest upon the plate upon which the deposit was forming.  To save the trouble and time required for drawing olf the fluid and   414 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS.  filtering off these impurities, the following simple and efficient plan  was devised : A bag of fine cotton is placed over a light wooden frame  which keeps it distended, this is gradually immersed in the solution  in the vat, and when it reaches the bottom it is found to contain a  clear filtered solution into which the plates may at once be immersed.  After the first day the plates are placed in another vat in a hori-  zontal position which is more favorable than a vertical one. The  opposed plate when loaded with impurities is removed and a fresh one  substituted, the increase of the dejjosits being estimated from the loss  of the opposed plates.  The attentive reader of this work will have seen the importance of  a galvanometer of some kind for ascertaining with precision the manner  in which the work is proceeding in the decomposing cell. It is not  always convenient to place such an instrument in the main circuit, and.  Mr. Mathiot has arranged i'or this purpose what he calls a \" branch  circuit galvanometer,\" which is in fact a galvanometer placed in a por-  tion of the current led ofi\" by a smaller wire so that the instrument may  have any desired position, an arrangement similar to that already  noticed in the first part of this report. If the portion of the whole  current thus diverted through the side conductor be small, the increase  of resistance due to the greater length of the wire will be but a small  matter when compared with the whole. It is an easy thing to deter-  mine by a few weighings the rate of deposition due to any particular  angle of deviation in the needle. â€” (Coast Survey Report lor 1855.)  By these well contrived arrangements electrotype copies of the most  delicate engravings are literally manufactured with undeviating cer-  tainty. The routine is so well established that an ordinary workman  can, when once well instructed, proceed without risk in the performance  of delicate operations, which at one time might be attended with hazard  in the hands of the most skilful. It must of course be understood that  we have not entered into all of the minutiae of the operations, for which  we must refer to the reports of the Coast Survey. The object has  been to show what we consider a notable instance of the influence of a  tliorough organization in carrying out in practice the most refined de-  tails. The application of this art to quite different objects would  necessarily involve a departure from the precise methods just described.  But the scientific basis, as laid down in the report of Miiller, will in all  cases be applicable. Many ingenious devices for attaining special  ends may be requisite, but they must all be in obedience to the known  laws of electricity.  Before concluding we must refer to one or two additional improve-  ments in the reproduction of copies of engraved maps which have  originated in the same quarter.  At an early period it Avas found a very desirable matter to add  together several detached maps or to correct or improve certain portions  of a finished engraving. It is obvious that this could be accomplished  by the nice adjustment of the parts which were to be the components  of the new map. But this required very accurate and skilful mechani-  cal manipulation, not without some risk to the engraved surface. The  plan devised by Mr. Mathiot for overcoming these difiiculties consists  in \"taking from the plates to be joined electrotype casts weighing not   RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSICS. 415  more than three or four ounces to the square foot. These being cut in  any required form with a pair of scissors, require merely to be cemented,  each in its proper place, on a blank plate coated thinly with shoe-  makers' wax.\" The facility of combination thus introduced has  greatly abridged the time and labor expended upon this species of  work. â€” (Coast {Survey Report of 1855.)  A still further extension of this idea is noticed in the Coast Survey  Eeport of 1857, p. 189. \" It is now practically ascertained that thin  electrotypes are all that is necessary; the stiffness requisite to print  from being given by stretching them on steel plates having a smooth  surface and cut to the proper size.\" Mr. Mathiot also adds as follows :  *' The working of the thin electrotypes has suggested to me the idea  of using these plates on a circular bed or roller, and gaining thereby  the great advantage of cylinder printing for flat plates.\" The im-  provement of copper plate printing by steam machinery is thus sug-  gested as highly probable. â€” G.

METEOROLOGY. 417  METEOROLOGICAL STATIONS CONNECTED WITH THE SENIOR COUNTY  GRAMMAR SCHOOLS.  [From the Annual School Report for 1858.]  1. Circular to the county councils and to the hoards of senior county  grammar schools in Upper Canada.  Gentlemen : I have the honor to inform you that the necessary  instruments for making meteorological observations at each of the  senior county grammar schools in Upper Canada have been procured  by the chief superintendent of education, and are now ready for dis-  tribution by this department.  The section of the grammar school law authorizing the establish-  ment of these meteorological stations in connexion with the senior  county grammar schools of Upper Canada is as follows :  \" Whereas it is desirable at seminaries and places of education  to direct attention to natural phenomena, and to encourage habits of  observation ; and whereas a better knowledge of the climate and  meteorology of Canada will be serviceable to agriculture and other  pursuits, and be of value to scientific inquirers :  ^^Be it therefore enacted, That it shall be part of the duty of the  master of every senior county grammar school to make the requisite  observations for keeping, and to keep, a meteorological journal, em-  bracing such observations, and kept according to such form, as shall  from time to time be directed by the Council of Public Instruction ;  and all such journals or abstracts of them shall be presented annually  by the chief superintendent of schools to the governor with his annual  report.  \" Every senior county grammar school shall, on or before the last  day of November, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, be pro-  vided, at the expense of the county municipality, with the following  instruments :  \" One barometer ; one thermometer for the temperature of the air ;  one Daniels' hygrometer, or other instrument for showing the dew-  point ; one rain-gauge and measure ; one wind-vane.  '' And it shall be the duty of the chief superintendent of schools to  procure these instruments at tlie request and expense of the municipal  council of any county, and to furnish the master of the senior county  grammar school with a book for registering observations, and with  forms for abstract thereof, to be transmitted to the chief superintendent  by such master, who shall certify that the observations required have  been made with due care and regularity.\"  The delay which has occurred in providing tliese instruments has  been unavoidable. Tliose first selected in the United KStates were found  to be unsuitable ; and upon consultation with Colonel Lefroy, so long  and favorably known in connexion with this department, improve-  ments, which experience in this climate had suggested, were adopted,  and a range as low as 35Â° and 40.Â° below zero was given to the ther-  mometers.  The instruments, when ready, were all tested by James Glaisher,  esq., and their variations recorded. They were also examined and  approved by Colonel Lefroy. In addition, the chief superintendent  27   418 METEOKOLOGT.  considered it important to subject them to a winter's test at the Pro-  vincial Magnetical Observatory, Toronto, before sending them out,  and to compare and note any variations which might be caused by  exposure to extreme cold.  The various instruments and books which are now ready for distri-  bution are as follows :  One barometer, either standard or one of a second quality.  A self-registering maximum thermometer.  A self-registering minimum thermometer.  A wet and dry bulb thermometer.  A rain-gauge and graduated measuring glass.  A copy of the Official Instructions and Directions for making and  recording Observations.  Daily register book, containing printed forms, and adapted for the  observations of one complete year.  Monthly and annual abstract book_, containing printed forms, and  adapted for the observations of one complete year.  Blank book for extraordinary records.  Map of the Stars, four tables, and synopsis, reprinted from the  Instructions and mounted for convenient reference.  A copy of Drew's Practical Meteorology.  A copy of Coffin's [Smithsonian] Hygrometrical Tables, bound up  with the Instructions.  (A wind-vane is not sent. It can easily be constructed at the  station.)  The cost of these instruments and books, including packing, &c. ,  will be $140, one-half of which will be borne by this department and  the other half by the county to which the instruments are sent.  \"Where desirable, an officer will be despatched from the department  with the instruments to insure safety in their carriage and to assist  in fitting them up at the proposed station. Should you desire the  instruments to be sent to your grammar school, I will thank you to  notify me at your earliest convenience, so that the necessary arrange-  ments lor that purpose may be made, and transmit the required  amount ($70) with the enclosed form duly filled up. Where, instead  of the standard barometer, a barometer of the second quality is  selected, the price of the set of instruments, &c,, is $110, only one-  half of which ($55) need be sent.  The instructions for taking and recording observations, which have  been approved by the Council of Public Instruction, have been care-  fully prepared by the director of the Provincial Observatory, and  are sufficiently minute and explicit to enable the head master of tbe  grammar school to make the necessary observations without much  trouble. Attention and patience will be indispensable at first, but  time and practice will soon insure regularity and accuracy in the  observer.  In order to afford time for practice, it is suggested that no observa-  tions be recorded in the books sent until the 1st of January next. A  sufficient supply of unbound sheets will accompany each set of instru-  ments to enable the head master to record his observations on them  until that time. A form of monthly returns will also be sent by  mail, in which can be recorded each month's observations. These   METEOROLOGY. 419  monthly reports should be regularly transmitted to the chief super-  intendent, as required by law.  Of the great practical importance, to a new and but partially settled  country, of establishing (thus early in its history, and before its  physica,! condition is materially changed) a complete and compre-  hensive system of meteorological observations, I need scarcely remark,  as the subject will no doubt receive your attentive consideration. The  department will rely upon your cordial co-operation in the matter.  Every enlightened country in Europe is now more or less engaged  in prosecuting inquiries in this particular branch of science. In the  other parts of her Majesty's dominions, and in the United States,  meteorological stations have been long since established. Although  the science is yet comparatively in its infancy, yet from the aggregate  of facts which have already been collected at various points and in  different countries, truths of highest value and importance in scientific  research have been unfolded, unsettled theories have been tested, and  questions relating to physical phenomena, wliich had long remained  among the sealed mysteries of nature, have been satisfactorily solved.  I have the honor to be, gentlemen, your very obedient servant,  J. GEORGE HODGINS,  Depidy Super inter^dent..  Education Office, Toronto, September 25, 1857.  2. 3Ieteorological Stations Edahlished.  During the present year the following meteorological stations have-  been established at the senior county grammar schools in Upper  Canada :  1, Port Sarnia ; 2, Chatham; 3, Guelph ; 4, Hamilton; 5, Ni-  agara; G, Milton; 7, Barrie ; 8, Whitby; 9, Belleville; 10, Pictou ;  11, Perth; 12, Cornwall; 13, L'Original, (instruments purchased  but not yet sent for.)  Each of these twelve stations has been visited by an officer of this  department who, in addition to fixing the locality, position of instru-  ments, &c., has given practical instructions in the use of the instru-\"  ments with which the stations have been provided. It was not thought  necessary to supply wind-vanes, as they are easily constructed at the  stations. Instructions, however, were given for making approximate  observations of the direction and velocity of the wind.  Each of the stations has also been su{)plied with a sufficient quan-  tity of sheets of the various forms and abstracts for practice, previous  to making entries in the registers.  The daily register contains a sufficient number of the two forms, A  and B, for a year's observation, as follows :  Form A contains on each of its pages the following headings, viz :  ''Barometer corrected at 32\" Eah. ; Gaseous pressure; Temperature  of air corrected ; Wet bulb thermometer corrected ; Difterence of dry  and wet bulb; Elasticity or tension of vapor ; Humidity; Direction  and velocity of wind ; Appearance of sky ; Class and arrangement of  clouds; Amount of ckMidinci-s ; Clouds in motion â€” Class, Elei-atiou,  Direction, Form, and Velocity ; Aurora; General remarks.\" These  observations are required to be made three times a day, viz: at 7 a. m,,  1 p. m., and 9 p. m.   420   METEOROLOGY.   Form B contains blanks for one month's observations on one page,  the columns for which are, \" Day of the month ; Self-registering  maximum and minimum thermometers ; Daily range of temperature ;  Rain, Began at^ Ended at. Total duration ; Cubic inches in gauge ;  Depth in inches ; Snow, Began at, Ended at, Total duration ; Depth  in inches ; Total depth of rain and melted snow ; Remarks.\"  Full instructions having been given, the observers, after a little  practice, were required, in accordance with the act and regulations,  to transmit monthly abstracts of their observations to the educational  department, two forms for which were supplied as follows :  Form C, which is a condensation of forms A and B, contains columns  for the corrected observations, and the daily as vrell as monthly means.  Form D includes the \"highest, lowest, and monthly range of  barometer; also, the great ranges within twenty-four hours; the dates  and total number of rainy days, snowy days, foggy days, storms of  wind, frosts; columns for four classes of auroras: sky unfavorable,  observations doubtful ; sky unfavorable, observations impossible ; sky  favorable, none seen ; the highest, lowest, and monthly range of tem-  perature; the greatest and least daily range; the mean temperature of  the warmest and coldest days; lightning, thunder, hail, or rain;  meteors and optical phenomena; general remarks.\"  These abstracts are required to be certified as true copies of the  originals, and the observations as having been made with due regu-  larity, as required by law.

METEOEOLOGY. 421   [Correspondence.]  THE EAKTHQUAKE OF 1811 AT NEW MADRID, MISSOURI.  [From the narrative of an eye-ivitness.)  BY TIMOTHY DUDLEY, OF JACKSONVILLE, ILLINOIS.  I am indebted to James Ritchie, esq., of Jerseyville, Illinois, for  the facts embodied in this article, who was living with his family at  the time of this earthquake in the vicinity of its most violent commo-  tions, and those scenes were so vividly impressed upon his mind that,  after a half century has nearly passed away, they are as fresh and vivid  as though they transpired yesterday :  On the west bank of the Mississippi river, sixty-five miles below the  mouth of the Ohio, by the windings of the river, and about twenty  miles in a direct line, stands an old Spanish town called New Madrid.  The southern boundary line of Kentucky is the famous political  line of 36Â° 30' north latitude, constituting also the southern boundary  line of Missouri, crossing the Mississippi river a short distance  below New Madrid. Thirty miles below was an old French village  called Little Prairie, and south and west of this village is a long  cypress swamp extending north and south a distance of one hundred  and twenty miles, and in breadth east and west twenty-five or thirty  miles, which was called fifty years since the St. Francis swamps.  I have been thus particular in locating these old towns and lowlands  from the fact that evidence is continually accumulating which goes to  prove that all the commotions which have disturbed the eartli's surface  for the last half century in the western States have had their origin  in the St. Francis swamps.  On the IGth day of December, 1811, at two o'clock in the morning,  the inhabitants of New Madrid were aroused from their slumbers by  a deep rumbling noise like many thunders in the distance, accom-  panied with a violent vibratory or oscillating movement of the earth  from the southwest to the northeast, so violent at times that men,  women, and children caught hold of the nearest objects to prevent  falling to the ground.  It was dangerous to stay in their dwellings, for fear they might  fall and bury them in their ruins ; it was dangerous to be out in the  open air, for large trees would be breaking off their tops by the vio-  lence of the shocks, and continually falling to the earth, or the earth  itself opening in dark, yawning chasms, or fissures, and belching forth  muddy water, large lumps of blue clay, coal, and sand, and when the  violence of the shocks were over, moaned and slept, again gathering  power for a more violent commotion.  On this day tv/enty-eight distinct shocks were counted, all coming  from the southwest and passing to the northeast, while the fissures  would run in an opposite direction, or from the northwest to the  southeast.  On a small river called the Pemiseo at that time stood a mill owned  by a Mr. Riddle. This river ran a southeast course, and probably   422 METEOROLOGY.  was eitlier a tributary of the St. Francis or lost itself in those swamps.  This river blew up* for a distance of nearly fifty miles, the bed en-  tirely destroyed, the mill swallowed up in the ruins, and an orchard  of ten acres of bearing apple trees, also belonging to Mr. Riddle,  nearly ruined. The earth, in these explosious, would open in fissures  from forty to eighty rods in length and from three to five feet in  width; their depth none knew, as no one had strength of nerve suffi-  cient to fathom them, and the sand and earth would slide in, or water  run in, and soon partially fill them up.  After the earthquake had subsided there was not a perfect row of  trees left in this orchard â€” one-half destroyed, some leaning in one di-  rection, others directly contrary ; some covered to the limbs in these  chasms as they filled up, and others with their roots turned entirely  out of the earth.  Large forest trees which stood in the track of these chasms would  be split from root to branch, the courses of streams changed, the bot-  toms of lakes be pushed up from beneath and form dry land, dry land  blow up, settle down, and form lakes of dark, muddy water.  Where the travelled, beaten road ran one day, on the next might  be found some large fissure crossing it, half filled with muddy, torpid  water. It was dangerous to travel after dark, for no one knew the  changes which an hour might eifect in the face of the country, and  yet so general was the terror that men^ women^ and children fled to  the highlands to avoid being engulphed in one common grave. One  family, in their efibrts to reach the highlands by a road they all were  well acquainted with, unexpectedly came to the borders of an exten-  sive lake ; the land had sunk, and water had flowed over it or gushed  up out of the earth and formed a new lake. The opposite shore they  felt confident could not be far distant, and they travelled on in tepid  water, from twelve to forty inches in depth, of a temperature of 100  degress^ or over blood heat, at times of a warmth to be uncomfortable,  for the distance of four or five miles, and reached the highlands in  safety.  On the 8th of February, 1812, the day on which the severest shocks  took place, the shocks seemed to go in waves, like the waves .of the  sea, throwing down brick chimnies level with the ground and two  brick dwellings in New Madrid, and yet, with all its desolating  efiects, but one person was thought to have been lost in these commo-  tions.  A family of the name of Curran were moving from New Madrid to  an old French town on the Arkansas river, called the Port ; had  passed the St. Francis swamps and found some of their cattle missing;  Le Roy, the youngest son, took an Indian poney, rode back to hunt  them, and was in the swamp when the first shock took place, was  never seen afterwards, and was supposed to liave been lost in some of  those fearful chasms.  The Port was about one hundred miles below what is now called  Little Rock, and claims its settlement as far back as the settlement of   ^'\" I have used this expression because it was so given by the narrator, and used by the  people, as conveying the appearance of these scenes as they passed before them.   METEOROLOGY. 423  Philadelphia. It was about one hundred and fifty miles southwest of  the swamps, and the people heard the first shocks on the 16th of De-  cember, and at the same time as the citizens of New Madrid, but the  sounds and shocks came from the northeast,*  I will briefly notice some of the phenomena connected with these  earthquakes, the state of the weatber at the time, and the opinions  which the people held in regard to their origin, or the great cause of  them.  The weather was warm and smoky, and had been so for some days,  not a breath of air stirring, and so thick and smoky that the Kentucky  shore, one mile distant, could not be seen at all. They were in a  balmy Indian summer. The morning after the first shock, as some  men were crossing the Mississippi, they saw a black substance floating  on the river, in strips four or five rods in breadth by twelve or four-  teen rods in length_, resembling soot from some immense chimney, or  the cinders from some gigantic stove-pipe. It was so thick that the  water could not be seen under it. On the Kentucky side of the river  there empties into the Mississippi river two small streams, one  called the Obine, the other the Forked Deer. Lieutenant Robinson,  a recruiting ofiicer in the United States army, visited that part of  Kentucky lying between those two rivers in 1812, and states that he  found numberless little mounds thrown up in the earth, and where a  stick or a broken limb of a tree lay across these mounds they were all  burnt in two pieces, which went to prove to the people that these com-  motions were caused by some internal action of fire.  In the Mississippi river, about five miles above what was then called  the first Chickasaw Bluffs, but in later times Plum Point, was an island  about three miles long, covered with a heavy growth of timber, which  sank in one of these shocks to the tops of the trees, which made the  navigation extremely dangerous in a low stage of the river.  About four miles above Paducah, on the Ohio river, on the Illinois  side, on a post-oak flat, a large circular basin was formed, more than  one hundred feet in diameter, by the sinking of the earth, how deep  no one can tell, as the tall stately post-oaks sank below the tops of  the tallest trees. The sink filled with water, and continues so to this  time.  The general appearance of tlie country where the most violent  shocks took place was fearfully changed. 8o many farms were ruined  that our government gave to each landed proprietor a title to a sec-  tion (640 acres) of land in what was then known as the Boon Lick  country, on condition of proving their loss, and by relinquishing their  rights in the injured lands to government.  In all grants of land to private individuals, although the laws regu-  lating such grants may be very stringent, cunning men can be found  who will find opportunity to evade these laws, and sucli was the case  undoubtedly in many of these old grants, but the actual sufferers were   \"The shocks felt in October, 1857, were the most violent in St. Louis, and seemed to  come from the soutii or southwest. In point of fact, seldom a year passes when these shocks  are not felt. Slight, indeed, they may be, as the inhabitants are so accustomed to them they  pay no regard to them, and it is only when the more violent are felt, and extend beyond these  earthquake regions, that any notice is taken of them.   424 METEOROLOGY.  relieved, even if some few individuls were benefitted at the expense of  the general government.  This country was first settled under the Spanish government, ceded  by that government to France, and by the French government, under  the Emperor Napoleon, to the United States in 1803.  The Spanish government pursued a most liberal policy towards  settlers to encourage emigration^ every man who settled in this new  country being allowed one hundred arpents, a married man and wife  two hundred arpents, each male child also one hundred, each female  child fifty, and twenty arpents to each slave, but in no case to exceed  six hundred arpents to each family, or one square mile, an arpent  being about seven-eighths of an English acre, and no single claim to  be more than eighty rods in breadth fronting on the river.  The purchase took place in April, 1803, was ratified by the Ameri-  can Congress in December following, and all settlers from the time of  the purchase in April to the ratification of the treaty were allowed  the same privilege as those which were taken under the Spanish  government.  The face of the country had been so much changed by the terrific  explosions and commotions of these earthquakes, so many fields,  dwellings, and other kinds of property destroyed, that Congress passed  the law for their relief before alluded to, but the remembrance of those  awful scenes still remains in the memory of the few survivors who  witnessed them, and will probably linger around the memory of the  past until their eyelids close in \" the sleep that knows no waking.\"   METEOROLOGY.   425   DISPERSION OF A CLOUD BY AN ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE.   FROM D. W. NAILL, OF SAM S CREEK, MARYLAND.   The accompanying diagram is intended to illustrate an unusual  occurrence, so far as I am informed, an account of which is submitted  for your consideration.  On the 30th July, 1856, a heavy Fig. i.  storm of rain, with some hail and sharp  thunder and lightning, occurred at 6  o'clock p. m.  A second storm of rain came up at T  p.m. from the southwest, before which  a white cloud of the form represented  in fig. 1 was scudding. It was of beau-  tiful whiteness as it appeared between  the observer and the dark face of the  first cloud. It was a conspicuous ob-  ject, and I had observed its progress  along the face of the Parr Ridge for  some two miles, and I should suppose  it to have been a mile distant, when a discharge of lightning passed  down through it, when it was dis- ^.â€ž ,  persed or thrown into fragments, as  shown in fig. 2.  Regarding the occurrence as very  unusual, I looked at the slight remains  of the cloud from different positions, to  satisfy myself that I was not deceived. ^^^W  Having never observed or heard of  such an occurrence before, it has  awakened many reflections in my mind  in relation to the production of elec-  tricity in the clouds, and the offices it  performs there, in its amazing power.    426 COERESPONDENCE.  â–  COHEESPONDENCE   commdnioation from dr. robert hare, on a method of forming  small weights. Â«  August 29, 1856.  I submit, in writing, tlie proposition respecting the production of  small weights which I made to the American Association for the  Advancement of Science, at a recent meeting.  In chemical analysis, and in the assay of the precious metals, the  accuracy of the extremely minute weights employed is of the utmost  importance.  As the governmont has undertaken to furnish standard weights  and measures for the larger operations or transactions of commerce  and the arts, without which accuracy and uniformity could not be  secured to the country at large, so it would seem consistent that to  the minute processes of the arts and sciences a help should be given  which otherwise seems not to be attainable.  The usual process of making weights, by reducing them till they  exactly counterpoise a standard weight, cannot be pursued advan-  tageously when tbey are less each than a tenth of a grain. For  the making of weights below that size, measurement and division are  preferably employed.  An instrument constructed by an ingenious and skilful machinist  (Tyler) is capable of dividing an inch into 1,400 parts by the action  of a ratchet and wheel, which may be so restricted in its motion as  only to move one tooth at a stroke, causing a platform to advance  only the fraction of an inch above mentioned.  For producing by means of this instrument tenths and hundredths  of a grain, a convenient length of very fine palladium wire may be  employed. This being reduced in length very cautiously till it weighs  some equimultiple of a grain, a distance commensurate with the  length of this wire is marked upon a suitable narrow brass plate by a  knife. The number of the ratchet strokes which must be made in  order to measure this distance must be ascertained.  Dividing this number by the number of grains will give the num-  ber of ratchet movements in a length of the wire equal in weight to  a grain ; again dividing this by ten will give the number of such  movements in a length equal to a tenth of a grain ; and, in like man-  ner, if divided by one hundred will give the number of the movements  in question requisite to designate the length equal to yoVo^ ^^^ ^  grain. The length equal to as much of the wire as would weigh a  tenth of a grain being thus founds this distance is to be marked on  the brass plate with a sharp edge.  A strip of steel is in th6 next place sharpened at each end to  a fine edge, and bent so as to resemble a long narrow staple, is  to be furnished midway with a scrc.v, by which the ends can be  '-'â–  Accidentally omitted in the last report.   CORRESPONDENCE. 427  made nearer or fartlier apart, like the points of sprinfjj compasses.  By these means, with the aid of a lens, the ed^es 06 the tool thus  constructed are to be made to coincide exactly with the marks desig-  nating the length of wire equal to the tenth of a grain.  Having made this adjustment by the action of the tool, ten pieces  of the wire being cut and afterwards weighed against a standard  grain weight, if found, too light or too heavy, the screw regulating  the distance must be touched so as to cause the distance to be increased  or diminished, rendering the cuts larger or smaller. When they arc  brought to the weight required, they should, by a delicate assay  balance, be tried against each other to ascertain that they are equal  in weight to each other.  Having thus obtained tenths of a grain in weight equal to each  other, fifths may be made by the same process and tried against the  tenths, tv/o to one, and against each other ; hundredths may be ob-  tained by a like process ; for each a tool being requisite like that used  for cutting tenths, excepting that it should be smaller in proportion  as the lengths required to be cut are shorter.  The instrument by which these results were obtained has a peculiar  capability of reducing the size of the graduatiouR to the limits requi-  site to include a greater or less number within any necessary length.  Suppose it desirable to have as much of a rod as would be equivalent  in bulk to a cubic inch of water divided into such degrees as would  increase hundredths of a cubic inch. Let a tube sufficiently large to  receive the whole length of the rod be at one end recurved at right  angles, and terminated in a point with a capillary orifice. Let the  other end be furnished with a stuffing-box to receive the rod, making  a water-tight juncture. The tube is to be replete with water, the rod  entering so as to reach a little beyond the stuffing-box. A mark is  then to be made on the rod as close to the box as possible. A light  cup being counterpoised on an accurate balance, and a weight equal  to a cubic inch of water being placed in the opposite scale, the apex  of the rod is to be introduced into the cup while the rod is shoved in,  until as much water has been forced into it from the tube as will  balance the weight employed as above mentioned. Another mark is  now to be cut into the rod close to the box as before. Thus a length  of the rod equivalent to the water excluded, and of course equal to a  cubic inch of that fluid, is thus indicated to exist between the knife  marks.  The number of ratchet strokes requisite to measure this distance is  in the next place to be ascertained and divided by the number of  graduations required. The quotient will be the number necessary to  make a degree.  Should the number of the ratchet strokes, when decided as above  mentioned, leave a fraction, it is to be gotten rid of by ineans of the  contrivance already alluded to for reducing each degree proportionally  to any reduction in the whole length necessary to a degree.  I am willing to put the instrument in question into the possession  of the government or of the Smithsonian Institution, on condition that  it shall be kept in good order for the purpose of furnishing accurate  weights, graduations, or measures of liquids or gases, for the purposes  of science and the arts.   428 COERESPONDENCE.  e PLAN OF A BIBLIOGRAPHY.  BY DR. JULIUS FRIEDLANDER.  The daily increase in every department of the sciences by the con-  stant labors of learned men in all parts of the world, resulting in an  extensive amount of new researches and speculations has become so  large, as to make it impossible for any student of science to keep  progress with it. Annual reports on each department have been ac-  cordingly felt for many years as an indispensable necessity. The  reports on chemistry by Berzeliusand Kopp ; on botany by Wikstrom ;  on zoology by Froschel and others; and those famous ones by the  British Association for the Advancement of Science are specimens of  such annual reviews. Still these reports but incompletely satisfy the  want that is felt. If a philosopher who is about to undertake a new  investigation, to study nev/ phenomena, to establish a new hypothesis,  or to contrive a new apparatus, wishes to know what has been pre-  viously done in the same direction, he has a very laborious undertak-  ing before him, and is obliged to rely upon manuals and encyclopedias  merely, unless he has a very extensive library. If he has the latter,  he is still in want of a general index. Everyman engaged in learned  pursuits is constantly appealed to for information as to where this dis-  covery may be found or that experiment detailed.  Many researches are commenced in different parts of the world,  and experiments instituted, which have been already pursued and  tried many years before, and consequently much valuable time is  lost from ignorance of the sources of information whence a knowl-  edge of what has been previously done might have been acquired.  The want of a general encyclopedic account of all that has been pub-  lished on the natural sciences has been long felt, and attempts would  have been made to supply this want, could the heavy expense of such  a work been covered by private individuals. The literature of natural  science is so extensive and diffused through so many periodicals,  transactions of academies and learned societies, encyclopedias, and  other publications, that v/hen we desire to have access to it we cannot  iind it in one place, but must visit Berlin, Vienna, London, and Paris,  besides various private libraries, and moreover be a bibliographer as  well as versed in the sciences.  It certainly seems in character with the objects of the Smithsonian  Institution to promote the publication of such a work as is required,  and nowhere is its necessity so much felt as in America, and in this  Institution, to which such frequent reference is made for the informa-  tion such a publication would furnish.  In accordance with the expressed desire of Professor Henry, the  Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, I will now proceed to trace out  the plan of such a work:  In the first place, I should prepare a general complete bibliograph-  ical index of all the memoirs, periodicals, society transactions, ency-  clopedias, and other collected publications which treat of physics,  chemistry, mathematics, and astronomy, as far as I should be enabled   CORRESPONDENCE. 429  to do SO from the bibliographical researches afforded by the public  and ])rivate libraries of\" Berlin. Having first })ublished such an index,  I would send it to all the large libraries and the eminent scientific  men of the world, asking for additional information, while I myself  w^ould subsequently compare it with the contents of the different  foreign libraries I should visit. By these means, I should be enabled  to find out what may remain to be done and to complete the work.  A scientific account would then be given of the contents of every publi-  cation, and recorded together with its perfect title. The place of pub-  lication of each would be given in addition to the title and contents. I  should trace out the sources of all extracts and translations together  with the original publications, but distinguish them carefully, mark  esjjecially where the full description and illustration of apparatus and  machines may be found, &c. In this way the titles and contents of  about forty or fifty thousand publications would probably have to  be recorded and arranged in a systematic order to be afterwards ex-  plained. Memoirs which have been translated or republished in  different periodicals should be brought under one title, and every source  v/here they can be found noticed, and information given as to where  the original was published, and whether the translation or republica-  tion be complete or not.  It will be necessary to devote the greatest care and attention to the  systematic arrangementof the work. I would certainly not pursue the  method of arranging according to authors' names. My classification  would be according to the scientific systems, with their various and  most extensive subdivisions. This would evidently be by no means the  least laborious part of the task.  After the systematic arrangement of the whole, the printing of the  work can be commenced in several departments at once. Every title  of a publication should have a particular number, and an index of  authors' names be added at the end. I may here remark, that it is  not intended to embrace the departments of mere technical inventions  and machinery, but of all scientific, theoretical and analytical memoirs.  Having thus given a general outline of the proposed work, I will  nov/ state to the Smithsonian Institution the conditions under which  I offer to undertake it. The sum which I ask from the Smitiisonian  Institution for the execution of the whole work is Â§5,000. $2,500 to be  paid in eight instalments during the progress of the undertaking, and  $2,500 on its completion, i. e., after the printing. 400 well printed  copies of the work are to be delivered gratis to the Smithsonian Insti-  tution. I will commence with the publication of the preparatory index,  the expense of which I shall defray myself. This volume will be the  guide to the whole work, and I shall proceed to make all the necessary  abstracts from the works mentioned in this first publication and those  met with subsequently. By means of the preliminary volume, I  shall be enabled to state when the one-eighth of tlie whole publication  will be completed. Baron Alexander de Humboldt, Professor Dove,  Professor Magnus, and Professor Poggendorf, witli whom I have the  honor to be acquainted, are all anxious for the publication of such a  work and will undoubtedly be willing to assist its execution. I   430 CORRESPONDENCE.  would propose also, that it sliould be submitted to the American  ambassador resident in Berlin. To provide for the event of death, I  shall assign the work to the latter. When one-eighth of the work  shall be completed, I propose that the Smithsonian Institution pay over  to me, through the American ambassador, one-eighth of $2,500. I  will submit the manuscript to the American ambassador, who will  return it to me for the systematic classification.  The manuscript will be completed after a thorough investigation of  the libraries of Berlin, Munich, Vienna, London, Paris, Stockholm,  the Hague, Brussels, Geneva, Milan and the United States. I shall  be allowed the privilege, if desirable, to employ a competent person  for the purpose of consulting and making abstracts from the various  American publications. The work will be printed on good paper in  one of the first German establishments, and be inscribed as a publi-  cation of the Smithsonian Institution. Every two months a report of  the progress of the work will be made to the Institution, by means of  which a proper judgment may be formed of its proceeding. The sale  of copies in Europe will cover the expense of printing.  It is only by means of such a work that a scientific person would  be able to execute a complete encyclopedia, such as Leibnitz proposed  to the academies. Access to such a publication can alone enable a  man to discover whether he has all- the material of his particular  department,  [The Koyal Society of London has undertaken to make a general  index of all the transactions of learned societies, which will consist of  about 250,000 separate titles. It will afford one of the most important  means of facilitating the advance of science which has been produced  during the present century, and it is to be hoped that provision will be  made for a distribution of copies of this work at a small cost to every  part of the civilized world, J. H.J   ACCOUNT OF ANTIQUITIES FEOM KENTUCKY.  BY S. S. LYON.  I have in my collection a few articles of antiquity, which may be of  general interest ; should they be deemed of sufficient importance by  you, and should you signify your desire, I will pack them up, and  send them to the Smithsonian Institution as a donation.* That you  may be able to understand what I propose to contribute, I shall give  you such an account of them, and a few of the facts in relation thereto,  as will fall into the compass of a page or two.  Three miles south of Raleigh, Union county, Kentucky, is the place  __â€” _ ___ â€”  * TheBe articles are now in the Smithsonian museum.   CORRESPONDENCE. 431  from which these objects were procured ; from this point to the line of  high water of the Ohio there are a great number of mounds and  burial places of the original inhabitants of the country, as well as  other mounds erected by these people, in which no bodies are found.  The mound from which the remains in my possession were taken is  about two or three feet higli above the surrounding earth, eighteen  feet in its shorter and twenty-one feet in its longer diameter. It is  situated at the north end of a flat point or ridge of land. The mate-  rial taken to cover tlie bodies which it contains is a fine silicious  earth of a recent deposit of this country, (For geological position see  map of Union county, Sec. 31, T. 1 S., R. 2 W., near the location of  Mr, Leonard Robinson.)  The bodies were laid upon the left side, the heads toward the centre  of a circle, and the feet outward. At the head of each was placed one  of the earthen vessels, of Avhich there are a great variety of forms and  sizes; the largest vessels always being placed at the heads of the  adults, smaller ones at those of the younger persons, and the smallest  at the heads of the children. Judging Irom the size of the bodies and  condition of the teeth, this burial place contained infants of a very  tender age, from six to ten months, and persons of various ages, from  childrens to adults of fifty or sixty years of age.  In all cases, rvithout exception, the bodies loere laid on the left side,  the heads toivard the centre of the circle. In some of the vases was  ibund a blackened carbonaceous (?) matter, probably the remains of  food, or an offering to the gods of the dead. In addition to the vase,  many of the bodies had one valve of one of the unios of the Ohio  river placed upon the forehead, the internal side of the shell turned  toward the head. In a few cases the larger vases contained a valve of  an unio, and all the small vases had a shell within or upon them.  Many of the shells accompanying the small vases and those found on  the foreheads of the children were carved and ornamented.  The bodies appear to have been laid upon the original surface and  covered to the depth of two feet or more ; at the heads of some of them  the earth is now from twenty-eight to thirty-four inches deep. In all  cases where there are bodies in these mounds the surface of the earth  has been discolored by fire. The heads of many of the adults appear  to have been compressed artificially.  llie folloioing is a list of the articles.  1st. Two specimens of extreme cases of comi)ression of the skull,  2d.

All the articles being quite fragile they were cleaned when first  procured and received a light coat of copal varnish, except the shells.  The ornamented shells before mentioned fell to pieces.  In the neighborhood of the locality where these mounds were found  are graves differing from those from which these objects were taken.  These graves are 29 by 34 inches square, from 7 to 9 inches deep ; the  bottom and sides lined with black bituminous shale^ and contain bones  broken into short pieces, as if the bodies had been forcibly thrust in  doubled up.  Many additional facts tending to illustrate some of the habits of the  aboriginal inhabitants could be procured if desirable.   NOTES ON BAROMETEK, RAIN AND SNOW GAGES, &c.  BY R. H. GARDINER.  My experience does not confirm the observation in the 33tl page of  the pamphlet Directions for Meteorological Observations upon the fall  of the barometer preceding a storm, and its rise during the storm.  On the contrary, when the barometer rises considerably above the  mean I consider it as an indication that a storm will occur within  31 hours ; and when it has not, and I have had an opportunity to  learn tlie state of the ocean on our coast, I have generally learned that  it was throwing a heavy sea upon the shore, showing that tlie storm  was not very distant. As. soon as the storm commences with us I  expect to see the barometer begin to fall and continue to fall till the  time when it is about to cease. Professer Cleaveland remarked to  me, many years since, that during a storm, as soon as he saw the  mercury in the barometer become convex he knew that the storm was  about over, and that fair weather might be expected immediately.  My experience fully confirms this observation. I consider it a general  rule, though I have known exceptions when, in a violent NE. storm,  the barometer has risen during the whole continuance.  There are two kinds of clouds proverbially with sailors precursors  of stormy weather, mackerel clouds and mare's tails, which are scarcely  sufficiently designated by cirro cumulus and cirro stratus, under  which I suppose that they must be classed.  In our cold climate, where we have frequently in the winter rain  with the thermometer below 32Â°, I consider that the rain gage I use  is superior to any I have ever seen. It consists of a funnel with  an upright copper edge, the superficies of which are exactly a foot   CORRESPONDENCE. 433  square. The funnel rests in a pail. I have a weight which exactly  balances the gage, and every ounce of the water is equal to G.012 of  an inch.  The advantages of this gage are that in the winter season, when  we have frozen rain or snow, the amount of rain is ascertained at once,  without the labor of melting and without the loss sustained thereby.  After it is weighed, a little hot water poured into the gage at once  melts the ice or snow. The size of the gage also makes it less liable  to error. I do not know how the depth of snow can be measured in a  violent storm by any gage. I have a wood of deciduous trees near my  house, and after every snow storm I have the snow carefully measured  in several places. It rarely varies more than one-half an inch. I  take the mean -of the different measurements. I consider a foot of dry  snow equal to an inch of rain. If the snow is moist I make an al-  lowance.  The aurora is of much more frequent occurrence here than in lower  latitudes.   SNOW GAGE.  BY W. E. GUEST, OF OGDENSBURG, NEW YORK.  I beg leave to remark that, during an experience of six years, no  better way has occurred to me to get at the true amount of precipita-  tion in the winter season, in this latitude, than the one pursued by  myself. As a proof of this, let me give you a description of the weather  yesterday: 7 a. m., wind NE.; 2 snow; mild. 11 a. m., wind SE.; 3  hail and rain. Noon, heavy rain. 5 p. m., wind S.; 4 squally, with  rain. 6 p. m., wind W., a gale; cold, freezing. This a. m., all  froze up.  Had I followed the instructions, viz : to insert the zinc vessel in the  snow, sliding under it a tin plate, and then reversing it, very little,  if any, could have been obtained. The rain fallen was all ice; the  snow was scattered in various piles. But with my tin tube, just the  diameter of the rain gage, and two feet in depth, so that what snow  gets in isnot blown out, and, when the storm is over, bring the vessel  into the house, melting gradually and measuring. The tin vessel  obtained by myself has a two-inch flange on the bottom to keep it from  blowing over, and sometimes it requires props to protect it. Our snow  storms are more or less accompanied by wind ; and, from the middle  of November to the first of April, our rains, which are infrequent,  invariably freeze in the falling. The tube you speak of is too small to  receive the snow; it would get clogged; and I cannot see the object of  placing it below frost; it would be arrested hy frost in its passage; and  the only way to obviate the difficulty known to me is the one above  proposed.  28   434 CORRESPONDENCE.  OBSERVATIONS ON THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF KEN-  NEBEC RIVER, MAINE.  BYR. H. GARDINER.  My rule for noting the river as closed is when the ice has remained  stationary for one ebb tide; as, in that case, I have never known it to  move again till there has been rain to raise the river. I have noted  the river as open when the ice has come down from above and gone  out of sight, several miles below. Previous to the erection of the dam  at Augusta the river closed from one to two days later at .this place  and below than above it^ and opened proportionably earlier in the  spring. Now there is much less difference; the dam, by converting a  succession of rapids into a large pond, causes the ice to become much  thicker than formerly and the water beneath to be nearer the tem-  perature of the earth. It has also prevented, to a great degree,  the breaking up of the ice in the winter. The subjoined account from  1785 to 1803 was taken from minutes made by General Dearborn and  continued by Major William Swan.  Opening.

January 28, 1839, river broke up as far as the point below the  sands. Cooper's ship-house and ship that v^ras building within it were  carried away, as was also the frame of another vessel.

Information in regard to the amount of water wliich passes through  rivers at different times is an important element in the improvement  of internal navigation in the application of hydraulic power, and in the  solution of various questions relative to meteorology. The following  letter from Captain A. A. Humphreys, of the Topographical Engi-  neers, who has had much experience in gaging rivers, will be of in-  terest to all who are disposed to co-operate in investigations of this  character :  Dear Sir : In reply to your request to give suggestions as to the  hest method of ascertaining the velocity and depth of rivers adapted  to amateur observers, I must first observe that any such plan must be  rough, as accurate measurements are very expensive.  The most feasible plan for ascertaining the cross section of the river  â– will be to employ a civil engineer to fix the position of a boat by tri-  angulation, while soundings are made from it directly across the river  from bank to bank, -v^ith a common chain and lead. A time of low  water and gentle current should be selected in order to insure accu-  racy. The contour of the bed between the water surfaceand high water  level must be ascertained by a spirit level. The area of cross section on  any day corresponding to any stage can then be readily computed from  the reading of a gage-rod when reference to high water is known.  Accurate velocity observations are too delicate and expensive for  amateur observers, but fair results may be obtained by the following  plan: A base line, say 200 feet in length, is measured parallel to the  current. Two range posts are placed at each end. Their lines of  direction being perpendicular to the base, and of course parallel to  each other, and perpendicular to the current, an observer is placed at  each range and a man with a skiff\" directed to throw over a block of  wood in the swiftest part of the current^ entirely above the upper range.  As this floats past the upper range, the observer shouts to his assistant  at the lower, who notes the exact time of its passing the lower range,  which he can see for himself. The difference of these times gives the  means of computing the velocity, which is equal to 200 divided by it.  This velocity is the maximum velocity of the river. The mean velocity  is about 0.8 of it. The discharge is, therefore, equal to the area of  cross section corresponding to the reading of the gage-rod, multi-  plied by the observed velocity, multiplied by 0.8.  This method, although rough, will give fair results, if properly  carried out. JSfo instruments are required, except a laatch and the  transit and level used by the civil engineers to assist at the soundings.  Your obedient servant,  A. A.
